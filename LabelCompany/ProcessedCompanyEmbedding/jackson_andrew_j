border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in  jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncles plantation in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of  which he opposed in the mids secondhand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina revolutionary war service young jackson refusing to clean major coffins boots  lithograph during the revolutionary war jacksons eldest brother hugh died from

was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in  according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in  to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and founding of memphis further information history of memphis tennessee in  jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter john overton overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw theirs was a frank avowal they like many of their contemporaries would deal with lands within indian territory most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of  that briefly opened to claim by north carolinians all of the indian lands in that states transmontane west he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in  early political career and tennessee militia after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state jackson became attorney general in  and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in  when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its us representative the following year the state legislature elected him as us senator he resigned within a year while in philadelphia then the nations capital jackson aligned himself with the democraticrepublican party and he strongly opposed the jay treaty in  with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of  jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making due to financial troubles jackson resigned the judgeship in  and returned fulltime to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia while serving on the tennessee supreme court he was appointed in  as a colonel in the tennessee militia in  he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers jackson with strong support from western tennessee tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february  governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence against sevier of land fraud subsequently in  when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier responded with hostility to jackson and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until  sevier took revenge on jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts and giving jackson control of only the west planting career and controversy notice of reward offered by jackson for return of an enslaved slave in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in  the next year he acquired the hermitage a acre  ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added  acres  ha to the plantation which eventually totaled  acres  ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves—jackson began with nine owned as many as  by  and later up to  making him among the planter elite jackson also coowned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed  slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as  slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in footsquare cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profitmaking enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wifes honor by may  charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in tennessee who called it a brutal coldblooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man as a result he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in  went on a tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements on october   jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at a moments warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas but all spanish north america he continued i have a hope should their be a call that at least two thousand volunteers can be lead into the field at a short notice—that number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprise—i think could look into santafee and maxico—give freedom and commerce to those provinces and establish peace and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers on our interior—which will be the case so long as spain holds that large country on our borders jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november  he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to numerous officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burrs behalf the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jeffersons efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed james monroe for president in  against james madison who was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democraticrepublican party military career war of  creek campaign and treaty main article creek war portrait by ralph e w earl c  leading up to  the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized but tensions with britain increased on account of a number of causes mainly these were britains persistent impressment of us sailors and interference with maritime trade during the napoleonic warswhich were seen as an offense against american honor and as a refusal to recognize american independence the encouragement of indian raids against american settlements and the desire of many americans for more land particularly british canada and florida the latter still controlled by spain britains european ally on june   congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland beginning the war of  jackson responded enthusiastically sending a letter to washington offering  volunteers however the men were not called up for many months biographer robert v remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support for burr and monroe meanwhile the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield on january   jackson led an army of  volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks he was to serve under general wilkinson who commanded federal forces in new orleans however lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez now part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent a letter to jackson dated february  ordering him dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march  jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies however he also promised to instead of dismissing the troops in natchez march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill according to remini jackson ordered his officers to turn over their horses to the sick and he surrendered his own three horses for the duty trudging along his men day after day never showing weariness or fatigue he cheered the men with a word a gesture a sign of pride in them he paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket the soldiers began referring to their commander as hickory because of his toughness and jackson would eventually become known as old hickory the army marched on average  miles per day and arrived in nashville within about a month jacksons actions earned him the widespread respect and praise of the people of tennessee

involved in a street brawl with jesse and his brother thomas jackson was severely wounded by jesse with a gunshot to the shoulder on august   a group of muscogee also known as creek indians called the

and allied muscogee were attacked by the red sticks at the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek jacksons troops repelled the attackers but outnumbered were forced to withdraw to fort strother

than  to  he engaged them at the battle of horseshoe bend an initial artillery barrage did little damage to the wellconstructed fort however a subsequent infantry charge in addition to an assault by coffees cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly creeks overwhelmed the red sticks the campaign ended three weeks later with red eagles surrender although some red sticks such as mcqueen fled to east florida on june  jackson accepted a commission as brigadier general in the united states army and  days later he became a major general in command of the seventh military division subsequently jackson with madisons approval imposed the treaty of fort jackson the treaty required the muscogee including those who had not joined the red sticks to surrender  million acres of land to the united states though in illhealth from dysentery jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas the first charge was true while the second ignored the fact that it was jacksons threats to invade florida which caused them to seek british protection in the november  battle of pensacola jackson defeated british and spanish forces in a short skirmish the spanish surrendered and the british fled weeks later he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which sat on the mouth of the mississippi river and held immense strategic and commercial value jackson abandoned pensacola to the spanish placed a force in

thought that jacksons conquest of florida would force spain to finally sell the province and spain did indeed sell florida to the united states in the adams–onís treaty of  a congressional

sully after returning to tennessee jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state but accepted john overtons plan to have the legislature nominate him for president jackson had come to detest secretary of the treasury william h crawford who had been the most vocal critic of jackson in monroes cabinet and he hoped to prevent tennessees electoral votes from going to crawford yet jacksons nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of  had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democraticrepublican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions in  jackson allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats and the legislature narrowly elected him his return after  years  months  days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history democraticrepublican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses but this method had become unpopular in  most of the democraticrepublicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed treasury secretary william h crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin criticized jackson as an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory but from incapacity military habits and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions altogether unfit for the office after jackson won the pennsylvania nomination calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead in the presidential election jackson won a plurality of the electoral vote taking several southern and western states as well as the midatlantic states of pennsylvania and new jersey he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking  percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won  electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of  which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral votewinners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federallyfunded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on

electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the oneparty era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy the accusation was technically true it was based on the legal status of rachels marriage and divorce from her former husband many years

nationalism and against secession jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people when selecting his cabinet instead of choosing party favorites jackson selected plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose martin van buren of new york as secretary of state john eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip inauguration main article first inauguration of andrew jackson on march   andrew jackson became the first united states presidentelect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the us capitol in his inaugural speech jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency he also promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair main article petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president john c calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war john h eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state martin van buren a widower was already forming a coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton in the spring of  jackson at van burens suggestion demanded the resignations of all the cabinet member except postmaster general william t barry van buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias in  jackson nominated van buren to be minister to england calhoun blocked the nomination with a tiebreaking vote against it claiming the defeated nomination would kill him sir kill dead he will never kick sir never kick van buren however fully recovered and played a leading role in the jacksons unofficial kitchen cabinet indian removal policy further information indian removal indian removal act and trail of tears jacksons indian removal act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several indian tribes from their traditional territories including the trail of tears since jackson was a military commander he had played a prominent role in indian relations throughout his eight years in office jackson made about  treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jacksons presidency marked a new era in indiananglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency jackson painted by earl  in his december   first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may   congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of  and  and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in  refused to move in december  this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in  members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in  agreeing to move their tribe however the creeks later resisted leading to a second creek war the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the  supreme court decision in worcester v georgia in that decision us supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries also the court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor president martin van buren who sent  troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began subsequently as many as  cherokees died on the trail of tears in  more than  american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in  after a group of indians crossed into us territory jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting around  jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left such as howard zinn often on this issue zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in  francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the very hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini argues that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribesnamely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move reforms rotation of offices and spoils system further information spoils system filejackson andrewpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of jackson as president in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the postal service jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vicepresident to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress jacksons time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of  for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need while an act of july  enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in  jackson established the tenhour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed earlier by president monroe in  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing fathertoson succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about  of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency nullification crisis main article nullification crisis in  congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the issue nonetheless came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of  secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of  although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident was at the april   jefferson day dinner involving afterdinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved – a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may  jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure thengeneral jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in  while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february  the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november  established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the democratic party on july   jackson signed into law the tariff of  it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but the nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november  the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of  and the tariff of  in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december   with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina in december  jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution  forms a government not a league  to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nation jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by clay agreed to a reduced compromise tariff the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march   and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may   jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs jacksons minister to france william c rives successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with france in  addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office in  spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july   that would award the us ₣   in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by  the nonpayment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december  state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for nonpayment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december  state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february  american reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased  while imports increased  jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for  failed the chargé daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in  the texas revolution began when proslavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may  they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an antislavery issue during the  election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a chargé daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march   jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade with china and japan he was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america bank veto and election of  main articles bank war banking in the jacksonian era and united states presidential election   electoral college results  democratic cartoon shows jackson destroying the devils bank the  presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december  nominated henry clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the antimasonic party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september  nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons in  the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of  in  president james monroe appointed nicholas biddle the banks third and last executive to run the bank clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers in january  biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the banks charter four years before the original year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june  and the house on july   jackson believing that bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners vetoed the bill on july  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes clay received  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the antimasonic party folded jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in  jackson attempted to began removing federal deposits from the bank whose moneylending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately probank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger b taney a strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic intended to force jackson into a compromise the move backfired increasing antibank sentiment in  those who opposed jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy a movement emerged amongst whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jacksonrival senator henry clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march  the senate voted to censure jackson – it also rejected taney as treasury secretary finally on january   when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in  in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes causing the panic of  the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the thcentury cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in  had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrences attempt on jacksons life as depicted in an  etching the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may   jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january   what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically richard iii dead since —and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life however his suspicions were never proven antislavery tracts during the summer of  northern abolitionists began sending antislavery tracts through the us postal system into the south proslavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary some rioting also broke out jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the  election jackson also fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the antislavery tracts he subsequently called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition uss porpoise a brig ship laid down in  and launched in may  by secretary of navy dickerson used in the us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from  to  led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in  but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in  he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to thomas jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may   jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until  during the presidency of van buren one brig ship uss porpoise later used in the expedition

bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills in january  jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished however reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the panic of  contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in  and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in  that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in  contributed to the panic of  the specie circular that mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act that transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until  when the economy began to

jackson retired to his hermitage plantation in  and immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of  he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until  during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the  presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats during jacksons campaigns they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of james k polk of tennessee for vice president at the  democratic national convention over unpopular incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered however harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler was known to act as an independent and not be bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whig party in  when he vetoed two whigsponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing great satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up antislavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to reconquer the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially jackson again supported van buren for president in  and polk for vice president when a letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public van buren was moved into writing the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south jackson then threw his support behind polk for the nomination at the  democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required twothirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for reelection as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president with jacksons support polk won the  presidential election narrowly defeating the whig nominee henry clay a bill of annexation was finally signed by tyler on march   jackson died at his plantation on june   at the age of  of chronic

was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage his most controversial presidential actions included removal of the indians from the southeast the dismantling of the bank of the united states and his threat to use military force against the state of south carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the british at new orleans in the last battle of the war of  he was the main founder of the modern democratic party and became its iconic hero he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies jackson was criticised by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law “ far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demands—say rather anticipates and forestalls them  general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly ” — alexis de tocqueville democracy in america  volume i chapter xviii brands observes that jacksons reputation declined after the midth century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears on a more favorable note remini argues that jacksonian democracystretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workableas such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history—populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson–jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse  bill jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as  and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the    and  note most recently his image appears on the us  federal reserve note series  with a redesigned larger portrait in  treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by  an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the  banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on  different us postage stamps only george washington abraham lincoln and benjamin franklin have appeared more often he first appeared on an  cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a cent red stamp and the other a cent green stamp both issued in  memorials main article list of memorials to andrew jackson the tomb of andrew and rachel jackson located at the hermitage numerous counties and cities are named after him including the city of jacksonville in florida and north carolina the city of jackson in louisiana michigan mississippi missouri and tennessee jackson county in florida illinois mississippi missouri ohio and oregon and jackson parish in louisiana memorials to jackson include a set of four identical equestrian statues by the sculptor clark mills in lafayette square washington dc in jackson square new orleans in nashville on the grounds of the tennessee state capitol and in jacksonville florida other equestrian statues of jackson have been erected elsewhere as in

andrew johnson both us presidents born in north carolina there is a bust of andrew jackson in plaza ferdinand vii in pensacola florida where he became the first governor of the florida territory in  popular culture depictions jackson and his wife rachel were the main subjects of a  historical novel by irving stone the presidents lady which told the story of their lives up until rachels death the novel was the basis for the  film of the same name starring charlton heston as jackson and susan hayward as rachel jackson has been a supporting character in a number of historical films and television productions lionel barrymore played jackson in the gorgeous hussy  a fictionalized biography of peggy eaton starring joan crawford the buccaneer  depicting the battle of new orleans

the village of boneybefore also in county antrim his paternal family line originated in killingswold grove yorkshire england when they immigrated to north america in  jacksons parents probably landed in philadelphia most likely they traveled overland through the appalachian mountains to the scotsirish community in the waxhaws region straddling the border between north and south carolina they brought two children from ireland hugh born  and robert born  jacksons father died in an accident in february  at the age of  three weeks before his son andrew was born jackson his mother and his brothers lived with jacksons aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jacksons exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying jacksons father the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in  jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncles plantation in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of  which he opposed in the mids secondhand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina revolutionary war service young jackson refusing to clean major coffins boots  lithograph during the revolutionary war jacksons eldest brother hugh died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june   antibritish sentiment intensified following the brutal waxhaws massacre on may   jacksons mother encouraged him and his elder brother robert to attend the local militia drills soon they began to help the militia as couriers they served under colonel william richardson davie at the battle of hanging rock on august  andrew and robert were eventually captured by the british in  while staying at the home of the crawford family when andrew refused to clean the boots of a british officer the officer slashed at the youth with a sword leaving him with scars on his left hand and head as well as an intense hatred for the british robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword the two brothers were held as prisoners contracted smallpox and nearly starved to death in captivity robert jackson died on april   a few days after their mother elizabeth secured the brothers release after nursing andrew back to health she volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in the charleston harbor where there had been an outbreak of cholera in november she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave andrew became an orphan at age  he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother legal career and marriage after the revolutionary war jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school in  he worked for a time in a saddlemakers shop on bad terms with much of his extended family he boarded with several different people while teaching school or working for the saddlemaker in  he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under attorney spruce macay with the help of various lawyers he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar in september  jackson was admitted to the north carolina bar shortly thereafter a friend helped jackson get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the western district of north carolina which would later become the state of tennessee during his travel west jackson bought his first slave and in  having been offended by fellow lawyer waightstill avery fought his first duel the duel ended with both men firing into the air having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement jackson moved to nashville in  where he lived as a boarder with rachel stockly donelson the widow of john donelson here jackson became acquainted with their daughter rachel donelson robards at the time the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in  according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in  to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and founding of memphis further information history of memphis tennessee in  jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter john overton overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw theirs was a frank avowal they like many of their contemporaries would deal with lands within indian territory most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of  that briefly opened to claim by north carolinians all of the indian lands in that states transmontane west he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in  early political career and tennessee militia after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state jackson became attorney general in  and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in  when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its us representative the following year the state legislature elected him as us senator he resigned within a year while in philadelphia then the nations capital jackson aligned himself with the democraticrepublican party and he strongly opposed the jay treaty in  with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of  jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making due to financial troubles jackson resigned the judgeship in  and returned fulltime to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia while serving on the tennessee supreme court he was appointed in  as a colonel in the tennessee militia in  he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers jackson with strong support from western tennessee tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february  governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence against sevier of land fraud subsequently in  when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier responded with hostility to jackson and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until  sevier took revenge on jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts and giving jackson control of only the west planting career and controversy notice of reward offered by jackson for return of an enslaved slave in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in  the next year he acquired the hermitage a acre  ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added  acres  ha to the plantation which eventually totaled  acres  ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves—jackson began with nine owned as many as  by  and later up to  making him among the planter elite jackson also coowned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed  slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as  slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in footsquare cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profitmaking enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wifes honor by may  charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in tennessee who called it a brutal coldblooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man as a result he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in  went on a tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements on october   jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at a moments warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas but all spanish north america he continued i have a hope should their be a call that at least two thousand volunteers can be lead into the field at a short notice—that number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprise—i think could look into santafee and maxico—give freedom and commerce to those provinces and establish peace and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers on our interior—which will be the case so long as spain holds that large country on our borders jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november  he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to numerous officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burrs behalf the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jeffersons efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed james monroe for president in  against james madison who was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democraticrepublican party military career war of  creek campaign and treaty main article creek war portrait by ralph e w earl c  leading up to  the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized but tensions with britain increased on account of a number of causes mainly these were britains persistent impressment of us sailors and interference with maritime trade during the napoleonic warswhich were seen as an offense against american honor and as a refusal to recognize american independence the encouragement of indian raids against american settlements and the desire of many americans for more land particularly british canada and florida the latter still controlled by spain britains european ally on june   congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland beginning the war of  jackson responded enthusiastically sending a letter to washington offering  volunteers however the men were not called up for many months biographer robert v remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support for burr and monroe meanwhile the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield on january   jackson led an army of  volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks he was to serve under general wilkinson who commanded federal forces in new orleans however lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez now part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent a letter to jackson dated february  ordering him dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march  jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies however he also promised to instead of dismissing the troops in natchez march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill according to remini jackson ordered his officers to turn over their horses to the sick and he surrendered his own three horses for the duty trudging along his men day after day never showing weariness or fatigue he cheered the men with a word a gesture a sign of pride in them he paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket the soldiers began referring to their commander as hickory because of his toughness and jackson would eventually become known as old hickory the army marched on average  miles per day and arrived in nashville within about a month jacksons actions earned him the widespread respect and praise of the people of tennessee on june  jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer william carroll against jesse benton in september jackson and his top cavalry officer brigadier general john coffee were involved in a street brawl with jesse and his brother thomas jackson was severely wounded by jesse with a gunshot to the shoulder on august   a group of muscogee also known as creek indians called the red sticks so named for the color of their war paint perpetrated the fort mims massacre the red sticks led by chiefs red eagle and peter mcqueen had broken away from the rest of the creek confederacy which wanted peace with the united states they were allied with tecumseh a shawnee chief who had launched tecumsehs war against the united states and who was fighting alongside the british during the massacre hundreds of white american settlers and nonred stick creeks were slaughtered the resulting conflict became known as the creek war in the treaty of fort jackson the muscogee surrendered large parts of presentday alabama and georgia jackson with  men was ordered to crush the hostile indians on october  he set out on the expedition his arm still in a sling jackson established fort strother as a supply base on november  coffee defeated a band of red sticks at the battle of tallushatchee coming to the relief of friendly creeks besieged by red sticks jackson won another decisive victory at the battle of talladega in the winter jackson encamped at fort strother faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions he sent coffee with the cavalry which abandoned him back to tennessee to secure more enlistments jackson decided to combine his force with that of the georgia militia however from january   while on their way the tennessee militia and allied muscogee were attacked by the red sticks at the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek jacksons troops repelled the attackers but outnumbered were forced to withdraw to fort strother jackson now with over  troops marched most of his army south to confront the red sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the tallapoosa river on march  enjoying an advantage of more than  to  he engaged them at the battle of horseshoe bend an initial artillery barrage did little damage to the wellconstructed fort however a subsequent infantry charge in addition to an assault by coffees cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly creeks overwhelmed the red sticks the campaign ended three weeks later with red eagles surrender although some red sticks such as mcqueen fled to east florida on june  jackson accepted a commission as brigadier general in the united states army and  days later he became a major general in command of the seventh military division subsequently jackson with madisons approval imposed the treaty of fort jackson the treaty required the muscogee including those who had not joined the red sticks to surrender  million acres of land to the united states though in illhealth from dysentery jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas the first charge was true while the second ignored the fact that it was jacksons threats to invade florida which caused them to seek british protection in the november  battle of pensacola jackson defeated british and spanish forces in a short skirmish the spanish surrendered and the british fled weeks later he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which sat on the mouth of the mississippi river and held immense strategic and commercial value jackson abandoned pensacola to the spanish placed a force in mobile alabama to guard against a possible invasion there and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city the creeks coined their own name for jackson jacksa chula harjo or jackson old and fierce battle of new orleans main article battle of new orleans the battle of new orleans general andrew jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking highlanders by painter edward percy moran in  after arriving in new orleans on december  jackson instituted martial law in the city as he worried about the loyalty of the citys creole and spanish inhabitants at the same time he formed an alliance with jean lafittes smugglers and formed military units consisting of africanamericans and muscogees jackson received some criticism for paying whites and nonwhites the same salary these forces along with us army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states joined with jacksons force in defending new orleans the approaching british force led by admiral alexander cochrane and later general edward pakenham consisted of over  soldiers many of whom had served in the napoleonic wars jackson only had about  men the british arrived on the east bank of the mississippi river on the morning of december   that evening jackson attacked the british and temporarily drove them back on january   the british launched a major frontal assault against jacksons defenses despite some success in attacking the right flank the overall attack ended in disaster for the battle on january  jackson admitted to only  total casualties of these  men were killed  wounded and  missing or captured the british however

charged with preventing spanish florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves after spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves critics later alleged that jackson exceeded orders in his florida actions his orders from president monroe were to terminate the conflict jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize florida from spain once and for all before departing jackson wrote to

jacksons conquest of florida would force spain to finally sell the province and spain did indeed sell florida to the united states in the adams–onís treaty of  a congressional investigation exonerated

the treasury william h crawford who had been the most vocal critic of jackson in monroes cabinet and he hoped to prevent tennessees electoral votes from going to crawford yet jacksons nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of  had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democraticrepublican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions in  jackson allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats and the legislature narrowly elected him his return after  years  months  days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history democraticrepublican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses but this method had become unpopular in  most of the democraticrepublicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed treasury secretary william h crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin criticized jackson as an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory but from incapacity military habits and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions altogether unfit for the office after jackson won the pennsylvania nomination calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead in the presidential election jackson won a plurality of the electoral vote taking several southern and western states as well as the midatlantic states of pennsylvania and new jersey he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking  percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won  electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of  which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral votewinners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federallyfunded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on the

jackson was nominated for president by tennessee legislature in october  more than three years before the  election it was the earliest such nomination in presidential history and it attested to the fact that jacksons supporters began the  campaign almost as soon as the  campaign ended adamss presidency floundered as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics senator martin van buren who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in the  election emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adamss policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in the  election van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who also opposed much of adamss agenda van buren and other jackson allies established numerous projackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won a commanding  percent of the popular vote and  percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the oneparty era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy the accusation was technically true it was based on the legal status of rachels marriage and divorce from her former husband many years prior  to  jacksons campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for the czar they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and she never did well when jackson was away at war or work

president andrew jackson new york ritchie  co  jacksons name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jacksons philosophy as president was similar to that of thomas jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generationjackson took a moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and a limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people when selecting his cabinet instead of choosing party favorites jackson selected plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose martin van buren of new york as secretary of state john eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip inauguration main article first inauguration of andrew jackson on march   andrew jackson became the first united states presidentelect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the us capitol in his inaugural speech jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency he also promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair main article petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president john c calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war john h eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state martin van buren a widower was already forming a coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton in the spring of  jackson at van burens suggestion demanded the resignations of all the cabinet member except postmaster general william t barry van buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias in  jackson nominated van buren to

however fully recovered and played a leading role in the jacksons unofficial kitchen cabinet indian removal policy further information indian removal indian removal act and trail of tears jacksons indian removal act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several indian tribes from their traditional territories including the trail of tears since jackson was a military commander he had played a prominent role in indian relations throughout his eight years in office jackson made about  treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jacksons presidency marked a new era in indiananglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency jackson painted by earl  in his december   first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may   congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of  and  and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in  refused to move in december  this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in  members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in  agreeing to move their tribe however the creeks later resisted leading to a second creek war the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the  supreme court decision in worcester v georgia in that decision us supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries also the court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor president martin van buren who sent  troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began subsequently as many as  cherokees died on the trail of tears in  more than  american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in  after a group of indians crossed into us territory jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting around  jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left such as howard zinn often on this issue zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in  francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the very hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini argues that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribesnamely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move reforms rotation of offices and spoils system further information spoils system filejackson andrewpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of jackson as president in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the postal service jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vicepresident to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress jacksons time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of  for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need while an act of july  enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in  jackson established the tenhour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed earlier by president monroe in  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing fathertoson succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about  of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency nullification crisis main article nullification crisis in  congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the issue nonetheless came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of  secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of  although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident was at the april   jefferson day dinner involving afterdinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved – a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may  jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure thengeneral jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in  while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february  the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november  established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the democratic party on july   jackson signed into law the tariff of  it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but the nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november  the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of  and the tariff of  in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december   with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina in december  jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution  forms a government not a league  to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nation jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by clay agreed to a reduced compromise tariff the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march   and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may   jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs jacksons minister to france william c rives successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with france in  addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office in  spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july   that would award the us ₣   in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by  the nonpayment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december  state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for nonpayment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december  state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february  american reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased  while imports increased  jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for  failed the chargé daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in  the texas revolution began when proslavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may  they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an antislavery issue during the  election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a chargé daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march   jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade with china and japan he was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america bank veto and election of  main articles bank war banking in the jacksonian era and united states presidential election   electoral college results  democratic cartoon shows jackson destroying the devils bank the  presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december  nominated henry clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the antimasonic party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september  nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons in  the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of  in  president james monroe appointed nicholas biddle the banks third and last executive to run the bank clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers in january  biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the banks charter four years before the original year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june  and the house on july   jackson believing that bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners vetoed the bill on july  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes clay received  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the antimasonic party folded jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in  jackson attempted to began removing federal deposits from the bank whose moneylending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately probank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger b taney a strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic intended to force jackson into a compromise the move backfired increasing antibank sentiment in  those who opposed jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy a movement emerged amongst whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jacksonrival senator henry clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march  the senate voted to censure jackson – it also rejected taney as treasury secretary finally on january   when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in  in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes causing the panic of  the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the thcentury cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in  had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrences attempt on jacksons life as depicted in an  etching the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may   jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january   what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically richard iii dead since —and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life however his suspicions were never proven antislavery tracts during the summer of  northern abolitionists began sending antislavery tracts through the us postal system into the south proslavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary some rioting also broke out jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the  election jackson also fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the antislavery tracts he subsequently called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition uss porpoise a brig ship laid down in  and launched in may  by secretary of navy dickerson used in the us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from  to  led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in  but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in  he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to thomas jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may   jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until  during the presidency of van buren one brig ship uss porpoise later used in the expedition having been laid down built and commissioned by secretary dickerson in may  circumnavigated the world explored and mapped the southern ocean confirming the existence of the antarctica continent panic of  main article panic of  a new york newspaper blamed the panic of  on andrew jackson depicted in spectacles and top hat the national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills in january  jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished however reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the panic of  contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in  and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in  that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in  contributed to the panic of  the specie circular that mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act that transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until  when the economy began to

judicial appointments main article list of federal judges appointed by andrew jackson jackson appointed six justices to the supreme court of the united states states admitted to the union two new states were admitted into the union during jacksons presidency arkansas june   and michigan january   later life and death photographic copy of an  daguerreotype after serving two terms as president jackson retired to his hermitage plantation in  and immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of  he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until  during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the  presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats during jacksons campaigns they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of james k polk of tennessee for vice president at the  democratic national convention over unpopular incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered however harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler was known to act as an independent and not be bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whig party in  when he vetoed two whigsponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing great satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up antislavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to reconquer the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially jackson again supported van buren for president in  and polk for vice president when a letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public van buren was moved into writing the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south jackson then threw his support behind polk for the nomination at the  democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required twothirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for reelection as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president with jacksons support polk won the  presidential election narrowly defeating the whig nominee henry clay a bill of annexation was finally signed by tyler on march   jackson died at his plantation on june   at the age of  of chronic tuberculosis dropsy and heart failure according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed  but he subsequently revived  gen jackson died at the hermitage at  oclock pm on sunday the th instant  when the messenger finally came the old soldier patriot and christian was looking out for his approach he is gone but his memory lives and will continue to live in his will jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son andrew jackson jr except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members personal life family jackson had three adopted sons theodore an indian about whom little is known andrew jackson jr the son of rachels brother severn donelson and lyncoya a creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july   at the age of sixteen the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children john samuel donelson daniel smith donelson and andrew jackson donelson were the sons of rachels brother samuel donelson who died in  andrew jackson hutchings was rachels orphaned grand nephew caroline butler eliza butler edward butler and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler a family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachels niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jacksons private secretary and in  ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over a year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became cohostess of the white house in  it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in  jackson used rip raps as a retreat temperament tennessee gentleman portrait of jackson c  from the collection of the hermitage jacksons quick temper was notorious biographer h w brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his bloodcurdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record—in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of the presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c calhoun reminiwho is of the opinion that jackson was often in control of his rage and that he used it along with his fearsome reputation as a tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was a lean figure standing at  feet  inch  m tall and weighing between  and  pounds  kg on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age  he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and a hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in  jackson became a member of the first presbyterian church in nashville jackson was a freemason initiated at harmony lodge no  in tennessee he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee he was the only us president to have served as grand master of a states grand lodge until harry s truman in  his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage legacy and memory historical reputation equestrian statue of gen jackson jackson county courthouse kansas city missouri commissioned by judge harry s truman jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jacksons masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage his most controversial presidential actions included removal of the indians from the southeast the dismantling of the bank of the united states and his threat to use military force against the state of south carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the british at new orleans in the last battle of the war of  he was the main founder of the modern democratic party and became its iconic hero he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies jackson was criticised by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law “ far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demands—say rather anticipates and forestalls them  general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly ” — alexis de tocqueville democracy in america  volume i chapter xviii brands observes that jacksons reputation declined after the midth century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears on a more favorable note remini argues that jacksonian democracystretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workableas such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history—populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson–jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse  bill jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as  and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the    and  note most recently his image appears on the us  federal reserve note series  with a redesigned larger portrait in  treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by  an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the  banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on  different us postage stamps only george washington abraham lincoln and benjamin franklin have appeared more often he first appeared on an  cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a cent red stamp and the other a cent green stamp both issued in  memorials main article list of memorials to andrew jackson the tomb of andrew and rachel jackson located at the hermitage numerous counties and

washington dc in jackson square new orleans in nashville on the grounds of the tennessee state capitol and in jacksonville florida other equestrian statues of jackson have been erected elsewhere as in

andrew johnson both us presidents born in north carolina there is a bust of andrew jackson in plaza ferdinand vii in pensacola florida where he became the first governor of the florida territory in  popular culture depictions jackson and his wife rachel were the main subjects of a  historical novel by irving stone the presidents lady which told the story of their lives up until rachels death the

jackson presbyterians who had emigrated from northern ireland two years earlier jacksons father was born in carrickfergus county antrim in currentday northern ireland around  jacksons parents lived in the village of boneybefore also in county antrim his paternal family line originated in killingswold grove yorkshire england when they immigrated to north america in  jacksons parents probably landed in philadelphia most likely they traveled overland through the appalachian mountains to the scotsirish community in the waxhaws region straddling the border between north and south carolina they brought two children from ireland hugh born  and robert born  jacksons father died in an accident in february  at the age of  three weeks before his son andrew was born jackson his mother and his brothers lived with jacksons aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jacksons exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying jacksons father the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in  jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncles plantation in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of  which he opposed in the mids secondhand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina revolutionary war service young jackson refusing to clean major coffins boots  lithograph during the revolutionary war jacksons eldest brother hugh died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june   antibritish sentiment intensified following the brutal waxhaws massacre on may   jacksons mother encouraged him and his elder brother robert to attend the local militia drills soon they began to help the militia as couriers they served under colonel william richardson davie at the battle of hanging rock on august  andrew and robert were eventually captured by the british in  while staying at the home of the crawford family when andrew refused to clean the boots of a british officer the officer slashed at the youth with a sword leaving him with scars on his left hand and head as well as an intense hatred for the british robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword the two brothers were held as prisoners contracted smallpox and nearly starved to death in captivity robert jackson died on april   a few days after their mother elizabeth secured the brothers release after nursing andrew back to health she volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in the charleston harbor where there had been an outbreak of cholera in november she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave andrew became an orphan at age  he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother legal career and marriage after the revolutionary war jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school in  he worked for a time in a saddlemakers shop on bad terms with much of his extended family he boarded with several different people while teaching school or working for the saddlemaker in  he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under attorney spruce macay with the help of various lawyers he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar in september  jackson was admitted to the north carolina bar shortly thereafter a friend helped jackson get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the western district of north carolina which would later become the state of tennessee during his travel west jackson bought his first slave and in  having been offended by fellow lawyer waightstill avery fought his first duel the duel ended with both men firing into the air having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement jackson moved to nashville in  where he lived as a boarder with rachel stockly donelson the widow of john donelson here jackson became acquainted with their daughter rachel donelson robards at the time the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in  according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in  to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and founding of memphis further information history of memphis tennessee in  jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter john overton overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw theirs was a frank avowal they like many of their contemporaries would deal with lands within indian territory most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of  that briefly opened to claim by north carolinians all of the indian lands in that states transmontane west he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in  early political career and tennessee militia after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state jackson became attorney general in  and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in  when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its us representative the following year the state legislature elected him as us senator he resigned within a year while in philadelphia then the nations capital jackson aligned himself with the democraticrepublican party and he strongly opposed the jay treaty in  with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of  jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making due to financial troubles jackson resigned the judgeship in  and returned fulltime to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia while serving on the tennessee supreme court he was appointed in  as a colonel in the tennessee militia in  he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers jackson with strong support from western tennessee tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february  governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence against sevier of land fraud subsequently in  when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier responded with hostility to jackson and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until  sevier took revenge on jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts and giving jackson control of only the west planting career and controversy notice of reward offered by jackson for return of an enslaved slave in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in  the next year he acquired the hermitage a acre  ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added  acres  ha to the plantation which eventually totaled  acres  ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves—jackson began with nine owned as many as  by  and later up to  making him among the planter elite jackson also coowned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed  slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as  slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in footsquare cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profitmaking enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his

on his wifes honor by may  charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in tennessee who called it a brutal coldblooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man as a result he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in  went on a tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements on october   jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at a moments warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas but all spanish north america he continued i have a hope should their be a call that at least two thousand volunteers can be lead into the field at a short notice—that number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprise—i think could look into santafee and maxico—give freedom and commerce to those provinces and establish peace and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers on our interior—which will be the case so long as spain holds that large country on our borders jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november  he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to numerous officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burrs behalf the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jeffersons efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed

britain increased on account of a number of causes mainly these were britains persistent impressment of us sailors and interference with maritime trade during the napoleonic warswhich were seen as an offense against american honor and as a refusal to recognize american independence the encouragement of indian raids against american settlements and the desire of many americans for more land

federal forces in new orleans however lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez now part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent a letter to jackson dated february  ordering him dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march  jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies however he also promised to instead of dismissing the troops in natchez march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill according to remini jackson ordered his officers to turn over their horses to the sick and he surrendered his own three horses for the duty trudging along his men day after day never showing weariness or fatigue he cheered the men with a word a gesture a sign of pride in them he paid for provisions for the men out of his own

brigadier general in the united states army and  days later he became a major general in command of the seventh military division subsequently jackson with madisons approval imposed the treaty of fort jackson the treaty required the muscogee including those who had not joined the red sticks to surrender  million acres of land to the united states though in illhealth from dysentery jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas the first charge was true while the second ignored the fact that it was jacksons threats to invade florida which caused them to seek british protection in the november  battle of pensacola jackson defeated british and spanish forces in a short skirmish the spanish surrendered and the british fled weeks later he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which sat on the

garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of  had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democraticrepublican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions in  jackson allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats and the legislature narrowly elected him his return after  years  months  days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history democraticrepublican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses but this method had become unpopular in  most of the democraticrepublicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed treasury secretary william h crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin

regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking  percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won  electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of  which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral votewinners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federallyfunded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on the

van buren who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in the  election emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adamss policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in the  election van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who also opposed much of adamss agenda van buren and other jackson allies established numerous projackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won a commanding  percent of the popular vote and  percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the oneparty era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy the accusation was technically true it was based on the legal status of rachels marriage and divorce from her former husband many years prior  to  jacksons campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for the czar they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and she never did well when jackson was away at war or work

president andrew jackson new york ritchie  co  jacksons name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jacksons philosophy as president was similar to that of thomas jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generationjackson took a moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and a limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people when selecting his cabinet instead of choosing party favorites jackson selected plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose martin van buren of new york as secretary of state john eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved

promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair main article petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president john c calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war john h eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state

indian removal act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several indian tribes from their traditional territories including the trail of tears since jackson was a military commander he had played a prominent role in indian relations throughout his eight years in office jackson made about  treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jacksons presidency marked a new era in indiananglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency jackson painted by earl  in his december   first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may   congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of  and  and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in  refused to move in december  this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in  members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in  agreeing to move their tribe however the creeks later resisted leading to a second creek war the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the  supreme court decision in worcester v georgia in that decision us supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries also the court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor president martin van buren who sent  troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began subsequently as many as  cherokees died on the trail of tears in  more than  american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in  after a group of indians crossed into us territory jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting around  jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left such as howard zinn often on this issue zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in  francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the very hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini argues that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribesnamely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move reforms rotation of offices and spoils system further information spoils system filejackson andrewpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of jackson as president in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many

duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the postal service jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vicepresident to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress jacksons time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of  for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need while an act of july  enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in  jackson established the tenhour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed earlier by president monroe in  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing fathertoson succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about  of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced

the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the issue nonetheless came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of  secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of  although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident was at the april   jefferson day dinner involving afterdinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved – a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may  jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure thengeneral jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in  while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february  the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november  established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the democratic party on july   jackson signed into law the tariff of  it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but the nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november  the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of  and the tariff of  in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december   with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina in december  jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution  forms a government not a league  to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nation jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by clay agreed to a reduced compromise tariff the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march   and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may   jackson

rives successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with france in  addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office in  spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july   that would award the us ₣   in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by  the nonpayment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december  state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for nonpayment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december  state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february  american reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased  while imports increased  jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for  failed the chargé daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in  the texas revolution began when proslavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may  they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an antislavery issue during the  election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a chargé daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march   jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade with china and japan he was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america bank veto and election of  main articles bank war banking in the jacksonian era and united states presidential election   electoral college results  democratic cartoon shows jackson destroying the devils bank the  presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december  nominated henry clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the antimasonic party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september  nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons in  the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of  in  president james monroe appointed nicholas biddle the banks third and last executive to run the bank clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers in january  biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the banks charter four years before the original year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june  and the house on july   jackson believing that bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners vetoed the bill on july  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes clay received  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the antimasonic party folded jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in  jackson attempted to began removing federal deposits from the bank whose moneylending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately probank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger b taney a strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic intended to force jackson into a compromise the move backfired increasing antibank sentiment in  those who opposed jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy a movement emerged amongst whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jacksonrival senator henry clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march  the senate voted to censure jackson – it also rejected taney as treasury secretary finally on january   when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in  in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes causing the panic of  the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the thcentury cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in  had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrences attempt on jacksons life as depicted in an  etching the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may   jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january   what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically richard iii dead since —and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life however his suspicions were never proven antislavery tracts during the summer of  northern abolitionists began sending antislavery tracts through the us postal system into the south proslavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary some rioting also broke out jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the  election jackson also fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the antislavery tracts he subsequently called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition uss porpoise a brig ship laid down in  and launched in may  by secretary of navy dickerson used in the us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from  to  led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in  but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in  he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to thomas jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may   jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until  during the presidency of van buren one brig ship uss porpoise later used in the expedition having been laid down built and commissioned by secretary dickerson in may  circumnavigated the world explored and mapped the southern ocean confirming the existence of the antarctica continent panic of  main article panic of  a new york newspaper blamed the panic of  on andrew jackson depicted in spectacles and top hat the national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills in january  jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished however reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the panic of  contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in  and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in  that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in  contributed to the panic of  the specie circular that mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act that transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until  when the economy began to

states were admitted into the union during jacksons presidency arkansas june   and michigan january   later life and death photographic copy of an  daguerreotype after serving two terms as president jackson retired to his hermitage plantation in  and immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of  he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until  during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the  presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats during jacksons campaigns they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of james k polk of tennessee for vice president at the  democratic national convention over unpopular incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered however harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler was known to act as an independent and not be bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whig party in  when he vetoed two whigsponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing great satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up antislavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to reconquer the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially jackson again supported van buren for president in  and polk for vice president when a letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public van buren was moved into writing the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south jackson then threw his support behind polk for the nomination at the  democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required twothirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for reelection as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president with jacksons support polk won the  presidential election narrowly defeating the whig nominee henry clay a bill of annexation was finally signed by tyler on march   jackson died at his plantation on june   at the age of  of chronic tuberculosis dropsy and heart failure according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed  but he subsequently revived  gen jackson died at the hermitage at  oclock pm on sunday the th instant  when the messenger finally came the old soldier patriot and christian was looking out for his approach he is gone but his memory lives and will continue to live in his will jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son andrew jackson jr except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members personal life family jackson had three adopted sons theodore an indian about whom little is known andrew jackson jr the son of rachels brother severn donelson and lyncoya a creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july   at the age of sixteen the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children john samuel donelson daniel smith donelson and andrew jackson donelson were the sons of rachels brother samuel donelson who died in  andrew jackson hutchings was rachels orphaned grand nephew caroline butler eliza butler edward butler and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler a family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachels niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jacksons private secretary and in  ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over a year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became cohostess of the white house in  it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in  jackson used rip raps as a retreat temperament tennessee gentleman portrait of jackson c  from the collection of the hermitage jacksons quick temper was notorious biographer h w brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his bloodcurdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record—in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of the presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c calhoun reminiwho is of the opinion that jackson was often in control of his rage and that he used it along with his fearsome reputation as a tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was a lean figure standing at  feet  inch  m tall and weighing between  and  pounds  kg on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age  he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and a hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in  jackson became a member of the first presbyterian church in nashville jackson was a freemason initiated at harmony lodge no  in tennessee he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee he was the only us president to have served as grand master of a states grand lodge until harry s truman in  his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage legacy and memory historical reputation equestrian statue of gen jackson jackson county courthouse kansas city missouri commissioned by judge harry s truman jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jacksons masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage his most controversial presidential actions included removal of the indians from the southeast the dismantling of the bank of the united states and his threat to use military force against the state of south carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the british at new orleans in the last battle of the war of  he was the main founder of the modern democratic party and became its iconic hero he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies jackson was criticised by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law “ far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demands—say rather anticipates and forestalls them  general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly ” — alexis de tocqueville democracy in america  volume i chapter xviii brands observes that jacksons reputation declined after the midth century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears on a more favorable note remini argues that jacksonian democracystretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workableas such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history—populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson–jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse  bill jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as  and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the    and  note most recently his image appears on the us  federal reserve note series  with a redesigned larger portrait in  treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by  an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the  banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on  different us postage stamps only george washington abraham lincoln and benjamin franklin have appeared more often he first appeared on an  cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a cent red stamp and the other a cent green stamp both issued in  memorials main article list of memorials to andrew jackson the tomb of andrew and rachel jackson located at the hermitage numerous counties and

in lafayette square across from the white house credit luke sharrett for the new york times president trump believes in the “great man” theory of history specifically he believes that a great man a man like president andrew jackson could have stopped the american civil war in an interview with salena zito a reporter for the washington examiner on sirius xm’s “main street meets the beltway” mr trump said the following “had andrew jackson been a little later you wouldn’t have had the civil war he was a very tough person but he had a big heart and he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the civil war he said ‘there’s no reason for this’ ”setting aside the fact that jackson died on june    years before the first shells were fired on fort sumter in south carolina — and thus said markedly little on the subject of the civil war it is clear that mr trump believes in andrew jackson he sees similarities in himself with the seventh president both are presidential swashbucklers and populists their hardscrabble roots may differ but their attitudes do notand so mr trump believes that the civil war could have been prevented had his th century avatar been alive to take a stand we also learned from jon meacham the presidential historian that mr trump once boasted that he could have done a deal to avert the civil warmany of us believe this not about andrew jackson necessarily — the relative historical merits of eliminating the bank of the united states don’t quite stand up to the horrors committed as a result of his indian removal policy and the civil war was almost inevitable even before jackson’s presidency but we believe that history in its ebbs and flows could have been altered for the better by just one strong person and quite often we imagine that person is us continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story we may not believe that jackson could have stopped the civil war but we believe that we would have stood alone against the crushing tides of adolf hitler’s third reich or the worst of south africa’s apartheid we would have shepherded freedom riders across the american south and taken on the dogs and water hoses of eugene connor known as bull our movies tell stories of those who resisted the worst of humanity and we see ourselves on those screens we believe that we are better today than

value no matter what we tell ourselvesbut we don’t honor and remember order we want heroes not because we need them but because we believe that we would be them ourselves if things were only different

the small movements of a great many individuals for example think of the thousands of abolitionists the millions who voted for president abraham lincoln and those who moved west and changed the calculus of slave versus free stateswe are among those individuals our politics our decisions our very words will set us on a course of history we cannot possibly begin to predict history happens while we’re not paying attention even while we’re rehashing the history of something elsewe do not need to be andrew jackson or ideally someone far less likely to commit crimes against humanity we do not need to wait for a hero of our own making either we are what we’ve long awaited the mover and shaper of history the decider of our fate if the arc of history bends toward justice it is not bent by

jackson home » entries » andrew jackson by harold d moser  university of tennessee andrew jackson was the seventh president of the united states serving from  to  as war hero and the savior of his country he was one of a handful of americans who dominated the first half of the nineteenth century as president he redefined and strengthened the executive office championing the concept of a united nation against rising threats of disunion in all estimates he was one of the strongest presidents as well as one of the most controversial he lent his name to a movement jacksonian democracy and to an era the age of jackson jackson was born in the frontier settlement of the waxhaws in south carolina the youngest son of andrew and elizabeth hutchinson jackson both scotsirish from carrickfergus in northern ireland his father died a few months before he was born encouraged by his mother to enter the ministry jackson obtained a modest education and taught school for a brief time the revolutionary war interrupted his education and jackson volunteered his services to the american cause in  his brother hugh died from war injuries in  his other sibling robert died of smallpox which he and jackson had contracted while british prisoners of war at camden south carolina jackson recovered but later that year his mother succumbed to cholera while nursing sick family members in charleston at fourteen jackson was an orphan having only distant maternal relatives to supervise his continuing education which he resumed after a brief residence in charleston about  jackson arrived in salisbury north carolina where he read law for three years with two distinguished lawyers receiving his license to practice in  jackson commenced his profession in north carolinas western district in washington county now in tennessee by october  he had received an appointment as district attorney in mero district now middle tennessee and moved to nashville where he resided at the home of rachel stockley donelson the widow of john donelson a founder of the town there he met the widows daughter rachel who soon became his wife and the love of his life unhappily married to lewis robards of mercer county kentucky she had recently returned to her mothers home when efforts at reconciliation failed in early  rachel visited friends in natchez to escape further mistreatment later in the year her estranged husband solicited a divorce decree from the virginia assembly but the legislature remanded the petition to the courts of the kentucky district then a part of virginia apparently presuming that robards would proceed with the action jackson went to natchez and married rachel in august  robards however delayed divorce proceedings on charges of adultery until  and the court issued its decree on september   when andrew and rachel received news of the court decision they remarried on january   before a davidson county justice of the peace the jacksons settled in nashville and over the next few years jackson practiced law speculated in land bought the poplar grove farm in davidson county near the hermitage and commenced general merchandising in partnership with family and friends failed business ventures forced him to sell poplar grove and purchase the cheaper hermitage property eventually expanding to about one thousand acres which remained his home for the rest of his life the jacksons adopted a nephew andrew jackson donelson known as andrew jackson jr reared several indian orphans and served as counselors for numerous children of relatives and friends the hermitage farm generally managed by overseers and worked by slaves was a model for middle tennessee agriculture with orchards gardens livestock staple crops cotton gins and stills in the early s the jacksons built a larger house on the site where they hosted innumerable visitors fire destroyed a portion of the dwelling during jacksons presidency and in rebuilding he enlarged the house and added the front and rear porticos jacksons interest in politics continued even as he built his plantation as the new territory south of the river ohio organized for statehood jackson accepted election to its first constitutional convention and in the fall of  tennessee voters sent him to philadelphia as their first representative a year later the legislature elected him united states senator jacksons role in both bodies was undistinguished and he resigned in  to become a judge of the superior court now the tennessee supreme court for the next six years he rode circuit over the state resigning in april  by  jackson had abandoned his legal practice and storekeeping to devote his time to farming with occasional interruptions for local militia musters jacksons military duties markedly increased upon his election as major general of the tennessee militia in  and continued for the next twenty years though this period brought him national honor personal and political controversy clouded his fame in  he quarreled with john sevier and almost dueled with the governor in january  he caned thomas swann in may he killed charles dickinson in a duel and in september of that year he tacitly endorsed aaron burrs controversial western schemes early in  jackson ran a sword through samuel jackson and in september  he brawled with brothers jesse and thomas hart benton taking a bullet in the arm the bullet was removed during his presidency jacksons emergence as a popular national figure resulted from his distinguished service as major general in the war of  his first major assignment came when the war department in washington ordered his tennessee soldiers to natchez in  and there dismissed them jackson disobeyed orders and refused to abandon his men under severe hardships that earned him the name old hickory he marched the forces back to tennessee a year later he added to his reputation when he led his men into battle against the creek indians defeating them at talladega in november  at emuckfau and enotochapco in january  and at horseshoe bend in march  the treaty of fort jackson concluded in august  sealed the capitulation of the tribe and transferred most of its land in alabama and southern georgia to the united states having been commissioned major general of the us army in may  jackson soon received orders to defend the gulf coast against an expected british invasion he led his troops into florida seized pensacola and in early december marched to new orleans there in the early morning of january   a few weeks after the signing of the treaty of ghent he resoundingly defeated the british that victory brought immediate fame to many jackson was second only to george washington in service to the republic some however found certain aspects of his new orleans military record disturbing namely his approval of the military execution of six mutinous militiamen the imposition of martial law the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and his defiance of the orders of a federal judge jackson defended his actions on military necessity and muted criticism for a time over the next several years he negotiated land cessions in georgia alabama mississippi tennessee and kentucky at treaties with the cherokees choctaws and chickasaws presaging his controversial presidential policy of indian removal to accommodate advancing white settlement in  he led troops into florida to suppress the seminoles again seized pensacola and ordered the execution of two british subjects suspected of arming the seminoles the action precipitated a brief international crisis and a long congressional investigation jacksons vindication came in  when he supervised the transfer of the floridas to the united states under the  adamsonis treaty he later served as governor during the establishment of territorial government jackson resigned his army appointment on june   and retired to tennessee in  the state legislature nominated him for president of the united states a move seconded by other states and in  elected him to the us senate he resigned in  jackson consistently denied that he sought the presidency but declared it his duty to serve if elected in the presidential campaign of  jackson received both a popular and an electoral plurality over william h crawford john quincy adams henry clay and john c calhoun when the house of representatives gave the presidency to adams and adams appointed clay secretary of state jackson labeled the transaction a corrupt bargain that violated the will of the voters on that charge jacksons advisors launched the presidential campaign of  the ensuing presidential canvass was one of the nations dirtiest pamphlets and partisan newspapers probed the public and private lives of jackson and adams particularly jackson the parade of juvenile indiscretions seemed endless but the insinuations of moral depravity as evidenced by the jacksons marriages proved most painful jackson however was elected president that fall on december   rachel jackson passed away and her husband charged that her death had been hastened by the campaign slanders in january  the widowed jackson left tennessee for his inauguration reform was the keynote of the bereaved jacksons inauguration address in march  and reform remained the theme of his two terms as president he departed from practice by rejecting adamss cabinet as the senate recessed in midmarch jackson initiated a series of removals and appointments that his opponents denounced as the spoils system jacksonians defended the practice as a restoration of honesty and integrity and the destruction of entrenched privilege cabinet squabbles erupted during jacksons first term that ended in a reconstitution of the cabinet and the resignation of vicepresident john c calhoun nevertheless jackson maintained his commitment to reform and executed his will through the exercise of the veto killing the maysville road bill and the recharter of the bank of the united states the recharter of the bank became the focus of the presidential campaign of  between jackson and clay the real issue however was jackson analysis of jacksons election victory showed a decline in his support and the rise of a strong opposition during his second administration jackson continued to use the veto and took unprecedented actions in  without congressional approval he ordered federal deposits removed from the bank of the united states and placed in state banks forcing the resignation of the cabinet officer who refused his directive and in  he issued the specie circular which required the payment of government debts in hard money jacksons  proclamation against nullification defining the union as indissoluble assaulted states rights in consequence his opponents denounced him as a tyrant king andrew i and united to form the whig party by the end of the decade the second american party system had emerged in all the states jackson returned to the hermitage in early  many still considered him a hero and the spokesman of the common man he spent the remainder of his years in retirement consulting with numerous politicians on the issues of the day entertaining frequent visitors and managing his farm his health much damaged by dueling wounds and the rigors of military campaigns continued to decline in  at age seventyeight jackson died at the hermitage and was buried in the hermitage

longtime goal his presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the spoils system in american politics in  jackson signed the indian removal act which relocated most members of the native

abolitionism in his retirement jackson remained active in democratic party politics supporting the presidencies of martin van buren and james k polk though fearful of its effects on the slavery debate

andrew jackson was born on march   in the waxhaws region of the carolinas his parents were scotsirish colonists andrew and elizabeth hutchinson jackson presbyterians who had emigrated from northern ireland two years earlier jacksons father was born in carrickfergus county antrim in currentday northern ireland around  jacksons parents lived in the village of boneybefore also in county antrim his paternal family line originated in killingswold grove yorkshire england when they immigrated to north america in  jacksons parents probably landed in philadelphia most likely they traveled overland through the appalachian mountains to the scotsirish community in the waxhaws region straddling the border between north and south carolina they brought two children from ireland hugh born  and robert born  jacksons father died in an accident in february  at the age of  three weeks before his son andrew was born jackson his mother and his brothers lived with jacksons aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jacksons exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying jacksons father the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in  jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncles plantation in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of  which he opposed in the mids secondhand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina revolutionary war service young jackson refusing to clean major coffins boots  lithograph during the revolutionary war jacksons eldest brother hugh died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june   antibritish sentiment intensified following the brutal waxhaws massacre on may   jacksons mother encouraged him and his elder brother robert to attend the local militia drills soon they began to help the militia as couriers they served under colonel william richardson davie at the battle of hanging rock on august  andrew and robert were eventually captured by the british in  while staying at the home of the crawford family when andrew refused to clean the boots of a british officer the officer slashed at the youth with a sword leaving him with scars on his left hand and head as well as an intense hatred for the british robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword the two brothers were held as prisoners contracted smallpox and nearly starved to death in captivity robert jackson died on april   a few days after their mother elizabeth secured the brothers release after nursing andrew back to health she volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in the charleston harbor where there had been an outbreak of cholera in november she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave andrew became an orphan at age  he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother legal career and marriage after the revolutionary war jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school in  he worked for a time in a saddlemakers shop on bad terms with much of his extended family he boarded with several different people while teaching school or working for the saddlemaker in  he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under attorney spruce macay with the help of various lawyers he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar in september  jackson was admitted to the north carolina bar shortly thereafter a friend helped jackson get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the western district of north carolina which would later become the state of tennessee during his travel west jackson bought his first slave and in  having been offended by fellow lawyer waightstill avery fought his first duel the duel ended with both men firing into the air having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement jackson moved to nashville in  where he lived as a boarder with rachel stockly donelson the widow of john donelson here jackson became acquainted with their daughter rachel donelson robards at the time the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in  according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in  to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and founding of memphis further information history of memphis tennessee in  jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter john overton overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw theirs was a frank avowal they like many of their contemporaries would deal with lands within indian territory most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of  that briefly opened to claim by north carolinians all of the indian lands in that states transmontane west he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in  early political career and tennessee militia after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state jackson became attorney general in  and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in  when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its us representative the following year the state legislature elected him as us senator he resigned within a year while in philadelphia then the nations capital jackson aligned himself with the democraticrepublican party and he strongly opposed the jay treaty in  with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of  jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making due to financial troubles jackson resigned the judgeship in  and returned fulltime to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia while serving on the tennessee supreme court he was appointed in  as a colonel in the tennessee militia in  he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers jackson with strong support from western tennessee tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february  governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence against sevier of land fraud subsequently in  when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier responded with hostility to jackson and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until  sevier took revenge on jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts and giving jackson control of only the west planting career and controversy notice of reward offered by jackson for return of an enslaved slave in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in  the next year he acquired the hermitage a acre  ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added  acres  ha to the plantation which eventually totaled  acres  ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves—jackson began with nine owned as many as  by  and later up to  making him among the planter elite jackson also coowned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed  slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as  slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in footsquare cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profitmaking enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wifes honor by may  charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in tennessee who called it a brutal coldblooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man as a result he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in  went on a tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements on october   jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at a moments warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas but all spanish north america he continued i have a hope should their be a call that at least two thousand volunteers can be lead into the field at a short notice—that number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprise—i think could look into santafee and maxico—give freedom and commerce to those provinces and establish peace and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers on our interior—which will be the case so long as spain holds that large country on our borders jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november  he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to numerous officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burrs behalf the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jeffersons efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed james monroe for president in  against james madison who was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democraticrepublican party military career war of  creek campaign and treaty main article creek war portrait by ralph e w earl c  leading up to  the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized but tensions with britain increased on account of a number of causes mainly these were britains persistent impressment of us sailors and interference with maritime trade during the napoleonic warswhich were seen as an offense against american honor and as a refusal to recognize american independence the encouragement of indian raids against american settlements and the desire of many americans for more land particularly british canada and florida the latter still controlled by spain britains european ally on june   congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland beginning the war of  jackson responded enthusiastically sending a letter to washington offering  volunteers however the men were not called up for many months biographer robert v remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support for burr and monroe meanwhile the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield on january   jackson led an army of  volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks he was to serve under general wilkinson who commanded federal forces in new orleans however lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez now part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent a letter to jackson dated february  ordering him dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march  jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies however he also promised to instead of dismissing the troops in natchez march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill according to remini jackson ordered his officers to turn over their horses to the sick and he surrendered his own three horses for the duty trudging along his men day after day never showing weariness or fatigue he cheered the men with a word a gesture a sign of pride in them he paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket the soldiers began referring to their commander as hickory because of his toughness and jackson would eventually become known as old hickory the army marched on average  miles per day and arrived in nashville within about a month jacksons actions earned him the widespread respect and praise of the people of tennessee on june  jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer william carroll against jesse benton in september jackson and his top cavalry officer brigadier general john coffee were involved in a street brawl with jesse and his brother thomas jackson was severely wounded by jesse with a gunshot to the shoulder on august   a group of muscogee also known as creek indians called the red sticks so named for the color of their war paint perpetrated the fort mims massacre the red sticks led by chiefs red eagle and peter mcqueen had broken away from the rest of the creek confederacy which wanted peace with the united states they were allied with tecumseh a shawnee chief who had launched tecumsehs war against the united states and who was fighting alongside the british during the massacre hundreds of white american settlers and nonred stick creeks were slaughtered the resulting conflict became known as the creek war in the treaty of fort jackson the muscogee surrendered large parts of presentday alabama and georgia jackson with  men was ordered to crush the hostile indians on october  he set out on the expedition his arm still in a sling jackson established fort strother as a supply base on november  coffee defeated a band of red sticks at the battle of tallushatchee coming to the relief of friendly creeks besieged by red sticks jackson won another decisive victory at the battle of talladega in the winter jackson encamped at fort strother faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions he sent coffee with the cavalry which abandoned him back to tennessee to secure more enlistments jackson decided to combine his force with that of the georgia militia however from january   while on their way the tennessee militia and allied muscogee were attacked by the red sticks at the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek jacksons troops repelled the attackers but outnumbered were forced to withdraw to fort strother jackson now with over  troops marched most of his army south to confront the red sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the tallapoosa river on march  enjoying an advantage of more than  to  he engaged them at the battle of horseshoe bend an initial artillery barrage did little damage to the wellconstructed fort however a subsequent infantry charge in addition to an assault by coffees cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly creeks overwhelmed the red sticks the campaign ended three weeks later with red eagles surrender although some red sticks such as mcqueen fled to east florida on june  jackson accepted a commission as brigadier general in the united states army and  days later he became a major general in command of the seventh military division subsequently jackson with madisons approval imposed the treaty of fort jackson the treaty required the muscogee including those who had not joined the red sticks to surrender  million acres of land to the united states though in illhealth from dysentery jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas the first charge was true while the second ignored the fact that it was jacksons threats to invade florida which caused them to seek british protection in the november  battle of pensacola jackson defeated british and spanish forces in a short skirmish the spanish surrendered and the british fled weeks later he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which sat on the mouth of the mississippi river and held immense strategic and commercial value jackson abandoned pensacola to the spanish placed a force in mobile alabama to guard against a possible invasion there and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city the creeks coined their own name for jackson jacksa chula harjo or jackson old and fierce battle of new orleans main article battle of new orleans the battle of new orleans general andrew jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking highlanders by painter edward percy moran in  after arriving in new orleans on december  jackson instituted martial law in the city as he worried about the loyalty of the citys creole and spanish inhabitants at the same time he formed an alliance with jean lafittes smugglers and formed military units consisting of africanamericans and muscogees jackson received some criticism for paying whites and nonwhites the same salary these forces along with us army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states joined with jacksons force in defending new orleans the approaching british force led by admiral alexander cochrane and later general edward pakenham consisted of over  soldiers many of whom had served in the napoleonic wars jackson only had about  men the british arrived on the east bank of the mississippi river on the morning of december   that evening jackson attacked the british and temporarily drove them back on january   the british launched a major frontal assault against jacksons defenses despite some success in attacking the right flank the overall attack ended in disaster for the battle on january  jackson admitted to only  total casualties of these  men were killed  wounded and  missing or captured the british however admitted  casualties of these  men were killed including pakenham  wounded and  missing or captured after the battle the british retreated from the area and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the treaty of ghent had been signed in europe that december coming in the waning days of the war jacksons victory made him a national hero as the country celebrated the end of what many called the second american revolution against the british by a congressional resolution on february   jackson was given the thanks of congress and awarded a congressional gold medal alexis de tocqueville underwhelmed by jackson according to a  commentator later wrote in democracy in america that jackson was raised to the presidency and has been maintained there solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained twenty years ago under the walls of new orleans enforced martial law in new orleans jackson ordered the arrest of u s district court judge dominic a hall in march  after the judge signed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a louisiana legislator whom jackson had arrested state senator louis louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the new orleans newspaper challenging jacksons refusal to release the militia after the british ceded the field of battle jackson had claimed the authority to declare martial law over the entire city of new orleans not merely his camp jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrest of a louisiana legislator a federal judge and a lawyer and after the intervention of state judge joshua lewis lewis was simultaneously serving under

monroe in december  to lead a campaign in georgia against the seminole and creek indians jackson was also charged with preventing spanish florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves after spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves critics later alleged that jackson exceeded orders in his florida actions his orders from president monroe were to terminate the conflict jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize florida from spain once and for all before departing jackson wrote to monroe let it be signified to me through any channel  that the possession of the floridas would be desirable to the united states and in sixty days it will be accomplished  teracotta bust by william rush of general jackson jackson invaded florida on march   capturing pensacola he crushed seminole

florida to the united states in the adams–onís treaty of  a congressional investigation exonerated jackson but jackson was deeply angered by the criticism he received particularly from speaker of the

united states presidential election  jackson in  painted by thomas sully after returning to tennessee jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state but accepted john overtons plan to have the legislature nominate him for president jackson had come to detest secretary of the treasury william h crawford who had been the most vocal critic of jackson in monroes cabinet and he hoped to prevent tennessees electoral votes from going to crawford yet jacksons nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of  had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democraticrepublican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions in  jackson allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats and the legislature narrowly elected him his return after  years  months  days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history democraticrepublican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses but this method had become unpopular in  most of the democraticrepublicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed treasury secretary william h crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin criticized jackson as an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory but from incapacity military habits and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions altogether unfit for the office after jackson won the pennsylvania nomination calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead in the presidential election jackson won a plurality of the electoral vote taking several southern and western states as well as the midatlantic states of pennsylvania and new jersey he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking  percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won  electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of  which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral votewinners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federallyfunded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on the first ballot furious supporters of jackson accused clay and adams of having reached a corrupt bargain after adams

united states presidential election  and andrew jackson presidential campaign  jackson was nominated for president by tennessee legislature in october  more than three years before the  election it

his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics senator martin van buren who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in the  election emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adamss policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in the  election van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who also opposed much of adamss agenda van buren and other jackson allies established numerous projackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won a commanding  percent of the popular vote and  percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the oneparty era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy the accusation was technically true it was based on the legal status of rachels marriage and divorce from her former husband many years prior  to  jacksons campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for the czar they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and she never did well when jackson was away at war or work jackson blamed john quincy adams because adamss supporters had repeatedly attacked the circumstances for jacksons

and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jacksons philosophy as president was similar to that of thomas jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generationjackson took a moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and a limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people when selecting his cabinet instead of choosing party favorites jackson selected plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose martin van buren of new york as secretary of state john eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip inauguration main article first inauguration of andrew jackson on march   andrew jackson became the first united states presidentelect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the us capitol in his inaugural speech jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency he also promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair main article petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president john c calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war john h eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state martin van buren a widower was already forming a coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton in the spring of  jackson at van burens suggestion demanded the resignations of all the cabinet member except postmaster general william t barry van buren himself resigned to avoid

removal indian removal act and trail of tears jacksons indian removal act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several indian tribes from their traditional territories including the trail of tears since jackson was a military commander he had played a prominent role in indian relations throughout his eight years in office jackson made about  treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jacksons presidency marked a new era in indiananglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency jackson painted by earl  in his december   first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may   congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of  and  and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in  refused to move in december  this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in  members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in  agreeing to move their tribe however the creeks later resisted leading to a second creek war the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the  supreme court decision in worcester v georgia in that decision us supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries also the court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor president martin van buren who sent  troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began subsequently as many as  cherokees died on the trail of tears in  more than  american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in  after a group of indians crossed into us territory jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting around  jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left such as howard zinn often on this issue zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in  francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the very hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini argues that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribesnamely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move reforms rotation of offices and spoils system further information spoils system filejackson andrewpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of jackson as president in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the postal service jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vicepresident to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress jacksons time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of  for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need while an act of july  enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in  jackson established the tenhour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed earlier by president monroe in  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing fathertoson succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about  of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency nullification crisis main article nullification crisis in  congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the issue nonetheless came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of  secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of  although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident was at the april   jefferson day dinner involving afterdinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved – a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may  jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure thengeneral jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in  while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february  the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november  established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the democratic party on july   jackson signed into law the tariff of  it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but the nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november  the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of  and the tariff of  in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december   with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina in december  jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution  forms a government not a league  to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nation jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by clay agreed to a reduced compromise tariff the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march   and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may   jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs jacksons minister to france william c rives successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with france in  addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office in  spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july   that would award the us ₣   in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by  the nonpayment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december  state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for nonpayment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december  state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february  american reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased  while imports increased  jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for  failed the chargé daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in  the texas revolution began when proslavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may  they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an antislavery issue during the  election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a chargé daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march   jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade with china and japan he was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america bank veto and election of  main articles bank war banking in the jacksonian era and united states presidential election   electoral college results  democratic cartoon shows jackson destroying the devils bank the  presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december  nominated henry clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the antimasonic party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september  nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons in  the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of  in  president james monroe appointed nicholas biddle the banks third and last executive to run the bank clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers in january  biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the banks charter four years before the original year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june  and the house on july   jackson believing that bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners vetoed the bill on july  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes clay received  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the antimasonic party folded jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in  jackson attempted to began removing federal deposits from the bank whose moneylending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately probank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger b taney a strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic intended to force jackson into a compromise the move backfired increasing antibank sentiment in  those who opposed jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy a movement emerged amongst whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jacksonrival senator henry clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march  the senate voted to censure jackson – it also rejected taney as treasury secretary finally on january   when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in  in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes causing the panic of  the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the thcentury cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in  had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrences attempt on jacksons life as depicted in an  etching the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may   jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january   what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically richard iii dead since —and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life however his suspicions were never proven antislavery tracts during the summer of  northern abolitionists began sending antislavery tracts through the us postal system into the south proslavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary some rioting also broke out jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the  election jackson also fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the antislavery tracts he subsequently called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition uss porpoise a brig ship laid down in  and launched in may  by secretary of navy dickerson used in the us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from  to  led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in  but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in  he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to thomas jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may   jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until  during the presidency of van

jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished however reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the panic of  contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in  and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in  that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in  contributed to the panic of  the specie circular that mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act that transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until  when the economy began to rebound administration and cabinet the jackson cabinet office name term president andrew jackson – vice president

justices to the supreme court of the united states states admitted to the union two new states were admitted into the union during jacksons presidency arkansas june   and michigan january   later life and death photographic copy of an  daguerreotype after serving two terms as president jackson retired to his hermitage plantation in  and immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of  he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until  during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the  presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats during jacksons campaigns they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of james k polk of tennessee for vice president at the  democratic national convention over unpopular incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered however harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler was known to act as an independent and not be bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whig party in  when he vetoed two whigsponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing great satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up antislavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to reconquer the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially jackson again supported van buren for president in  and polk for vice president when a letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public van buren was moved into writing the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south jackson then threw his support behind polk for the nomination at the  democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required twothirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for reelection as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president with jacksons support polk won the  presidential election narrowly defeating the whig nominee henry clay a bill of annexation was finally signed by tyler on march   jackson died at his plantation on june   at the age of  of chronic tuberculosis dropsy and heart failure according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed  but he subsequently revived  gen jackson died at the hermitage at  oclock pm on sunday the th instant  when the messenger finally came the old soldier patriot and christian was looking out for his approach he is gone but his memory lives and will continue to live in his will jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son andrew jackson jr except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members personal life family jackson had three adopted sons theodore an indian about whom little is known andrew jackson jr the son of rachels brother severn donelson and lyncoya a creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july   at the age of sixteen the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children john samuel donelson daniel smith donelson and andrew jackson donelson were the sons of rachels brother samuel donelson who died in  andrew jackson hutchings was rachels orphaned grand nephew caroline butler eliza butler edward butler and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler a family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachels niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jacksons private secretary and in  ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over a year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became cohostess of the white house in  it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in  jackson used rip raps as a retreat temperament tennessee gentleman portrait of jackson c  from the collection of the hermitage jacksons quick temper was notorious biographer h w brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his bloodcurdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record—in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of the presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c calhoun reminiwho is of the opinion that jackson was often in control of his rage and that he used it along with his fearsome reputation as a tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was a lean figure standing at  feet  inch  m tall and weighing between  and  pounds  kg on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age  he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and a hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in  jackson became a member of the first presbyterian church in nashville jackson was a freemason initiated at harmony lodge no  in tennessee he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee he was the only us president to have served as grand master of a states grand lodge until harry s truman in  his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage legacy and memory historical reputation equestrian statue of gen jackson jackson county courthouse kansas city missouri commissioned by judge harry s truman jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jacksons masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage his most controversial presidential actions included removal of the indians from the southeast the dismantling of the bank of the united states and his threat to use military force against the state of south carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the british at new orleans in the last battle of the war of  he was the main founder of the modern democratic party and became its iconic hero he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies jackson was criticised by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law “ far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demands—say rather anticipates and forestalls them  general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly ” — alexis de tocqueville democracy in america  volume i chapter xviii brands observes that jacksons reputation declined after the midth century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears on a more favorable note remini argues that jacksonian democracystretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workableas such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history—populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson–jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse  bill jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as  and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the    and  note most recently his image appears on the us  federal reserve note series  with a redesigned larger portrait in  treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by  an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the  banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on  different us postage stamps only george washington abraham lincoln and benjamin franklin have appeared more often he first appeared on an  cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a cent red stamp and the other a cent green stamp both issued in  memorials main article list of memorials to andrew jackson the

jackson presbyterians who had emigrated from northern ireland two years earlier jacksons father was born in carrickfergus county antrim in currentday northern ireland around  jacksons parents lived in the village of boneybefore also in county antrim his paternal family line originated in killingswold grove yorkshire england when they immigrated to north america in  jacksons parents probably landed in philadelphia most likely they traveled overland through the appalachian mountains to the scotsirish community in the waxhaws region straddling the border between north and south carolina they brought two children from ireland hugh born  and robert born  jacksons father died in an accident in february  at the age of  three weeks before his son andrew was born jackson his mother and his brothers lived with jacksons aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jacksons exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying jacksons father the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in  jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncles plantation in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of  which he opposed in the mids secondhand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina revolutionary war service young jackson refusing to clean major coffins boots  lithograph during the revolutionary war jacksons eldest brother hugh died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june   antibritish sentiment intensified following the brutal waxhaws massacre on may   jacksons mother encouraged him and his elder brother robert to attend the local militia drills soon they began to help the militia as couriers they served under colonel william richardson davie at the battle of hanging rock on august  andrew and robert were eventually captured by the british in  while staying at the home of the crawford family when andrew refused to clean the boots of a british officer the officer slashed at the youth with a sword leaving him with scars on his left hand and head as well as an intense hatred for the british robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword the two brothers were held as prisoners contracted smallpox and nearly starved to death in captivity robert jackson died on april   a few days after their mother elizabeth secured the brothers release after nursing andrew back to health she volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in the charleston harbor where there had been an outbreak of cholera in november she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave andrew became an orphan at age  he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother legal career and marriage after the revolutionary war jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school in  he worked for a time in a saddlemakers shop on bad terms with much of his extended family he boarded with several different people while teaching school or working for the saddlemaker in  he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under attorney spruce macay with the help of various lawyers he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar in september  jackson was admitted to the north carolina bar shortly thereafter a friend helped jackson get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the western district of north carolina which would later become the state of tennessee during his travel west jackson bought his first slave and in  having been offended by fellow lawyer waightstill avery fought his first duel the duel ended with both men firing into the air having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement jackson moved to nashville in  where he lived as a boarder with rachel stockly donelson the widow of john donelson here jackson became acquainted with their daughter rachel donelson robards at the time the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in  according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in  to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and founding of memphis further information history of memphis tennessee in  jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter john overton overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw theirs was a frank avowal they like many of their contemporaries would deal with lands within indian territory most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of  that briefly opened to claim by north carolinians all of the indian lands in that states transmontane west he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in  early political career and tennessee militia after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state jackson became attorney general in  and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in  when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its us representative the following year the state legislature elected him as us senator he resigned within a year while in philadelphia then the nations capital jackson aligned himself with the democraticrepublican party and he strongly opposed the jay treaty in  with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of  jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making due to financial troubles jackson resigned the judgeship in  and returned fulltime to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia while serving on the tennessee supreme court he was appointed in  as a colonel in the tennessee militia in  he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers jackson with strong support from western tennessee tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february  governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence against sevier of land fraud subsequently in  when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier responded with hostility to jackson and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until  sevier took revenge on jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts and giving jackson control of only the west planting career and controversy notice of reward offered by jackson for return of an enslaved slave in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in  the next year he acquired the hermitage a acre  ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added  acres  ha to the plantation which eventually totaled  acres  ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves—jackson began with nine owned as many as  by  and later up to  making him among the planter elite jackson also coowned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed  slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as  slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in footsquare cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profitmaking enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wifes honor by may  charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in tennessee who called it a brutal coldblooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man as a result he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in  went on a tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise

provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november  he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to numerous officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson

garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of  had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democraticrepublican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions in  jackson allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats and the legislature narrowly elected him his return after  years  months  days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history democraticrepublican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses but this method had become unpopular in  most of the democraticrepublicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed treasury secretary william h crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin

regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking  percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won  electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of  which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral votewinners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federallyfunded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on the

van buren who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in the  election emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adamss policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in the  election van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who also opposed much of adamss agenda van buren and other jackson allies established numerous projackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won a commanding  percent of the popular vote and  percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the oneparty era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy the accusation was technically true it was based on the legal status of rachels marriage and divorce from her former husband many years prior  to  jacksons campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for the czar they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and she never did well when jackson was away at war or work

president andrew jackson new york ritchie  co  jacksons name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jacksons philosophy as president was similar to that of thomas jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generationjackson took a moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and a limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people when selecting his cabinet instead of choosing party favorites jackson selected plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose martin van buren of new york as secretary of state john eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved

promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair main article petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president john c calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war john h eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state

indian removal act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several indian tribes from their traditional territories including the trail of tears since jackson was a military commander he had played a prominent role in indian relations throughout his eight years in office jackson made about  treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jacksons presidency marked a new era in indiananglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency jackson painted by earl  in his december   first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may   congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of  and  and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in  refused to move in december  this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in  members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in  agreeing to move their tribe however the creeks later resisted leading to a second creek war the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the  supreme court decision in worcester v georgia in that decision us supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries also the court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor president martin van buren who sent  troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began subsequently as many as  cherokees died on the trail of tears in  more than  american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in  after a group of indians crossed into us territory jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting around  jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left such as howard zinn often on this issue zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in  francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the very hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini argues that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribesnamely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move reforms rotation of offices and spoils system further information spoils system filejackson andrewpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of jackson as president in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the postal service jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vicepresident to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress jacksons time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of  for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need while an act of july  enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in  jackson established the tenhour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed earlier by president monroe in  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing fathertoson succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about  of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency nullification crisis main article nullification crisis in  congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the issue nonetheless came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of  secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of  although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident was at the april   jefferson day dinner involving afterdinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved – a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may  jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure thengeneral jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in  while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february  the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november  established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the democratic party on july   jackson signed into law the tariff of  it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but the nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november  the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of  and the tariff of  in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december   with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina in december  jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution  forms a government not a league  to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nation jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by clay agreed to a reduced compromise tariff the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march   and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may   jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs jacksons minister to france william c rives successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with france in  addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office in  spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july   that would award the us ₣   in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by  the nonpayment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december  state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for nonpayment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december  state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february  american reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased  while imports increased  jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for  failed the chargé daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in  the texas revolution began when proslavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may  they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an antislavery issue during the  election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a chargé daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march   jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade with china and japan he was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america bank veto and election of  main articles bank war banking in the jacksonian era and united states presidential election   electoral college results  democratic cartoon shows jackson destroying the devils bank the  presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december  nominated henry clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the antimasonic party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september  nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons in  the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of  in  president james monroe appointed nicholas biddle the banks third and last executive to run the bank clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers in january  biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the banks charter four years before the original year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june  and the house on july   jackson believing that bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners vetoed the bill on july  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes clay received  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the antimasonic party folded jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in  jackson attempted to began removing federal deposits from the bank whose moneylending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately probank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger b taney a strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic intended to force jackson into a compromise the move backfired increasing antibank sentiment in  those who opposed jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy a movement emerged amongst whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jacksonrival senator henry clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march  the senate voted to censure jackson – it also rejected taney as treasury secretary finally on january   when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in  in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes causing the panic of  the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the thcentury cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in  had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrences attempt on jacksons life as depicted in an  etching the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may   jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january   what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically richard iii dead since —and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life however his suspicions were never proven antislavery tracts during the summer of  northern abolitionists began sending antislavery tracts through the us postal system into the south proslavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary some rioting also broke out jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the  election jackson also fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the antislavery tracts he subsequently called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition uss porpoise a brig ship laid down in  and launched in may  by secretary of navy dickerson used in the us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from  to  led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in  but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in  he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to thomas jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may   jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until  during the presidency of van buren one brig ship uss porpoise later used in the expedition having been laid down built and commissioned by secretary dickerson in may  circumnavigated the world explored and mapped the southern ocean confirming the existence of the antarctica continent panic of  main article panic of  a new york newspaper blamed the panic of  on andrew jackson depicted in spectacles and top hat the national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills in january  jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished however reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the panic of  contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in  and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in  that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in  contributed to the panic of  the specie circular that mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act that transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until  when the economy began to

states were admitted into the union during jacksons presidency arkansas june   and michigan january   later life and death photographic copy of an  daguerreotype after serving two terms as president jackson retired to his hermitage plantation in  and immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of  he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until  during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the  presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats during jacksons campaigns they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of james k polk of tennessee for vice president at the  democratic national convention over unpopular incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered however harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler was known to act as an independent and not be bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whig party in  when he vetoed two whigsponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing great satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up antislavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to reconquer the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially jackson again supported van buren for president in  and polk for vice president when a letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public van buren was moved into writing the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south jackson then threw his support behind polk for the nomination at the  democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required twothirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for reelection as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president with jacksons support polk won the  presidential election narrowly defeating the whig nominee henry clay a bill of annexation was finally signed by tyler on march   jackson died at his plantation on june   at the age of  of chronic tuberculosis dropsy and heart failure according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed  but he subsequently revived  gen jackson died at the hermitage at  oclock pm on sunday the th instant  when the messenger finally came the old soldier patriot and christian was looking out for his approach he is gone but his memory lives and will continue to live in his will jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son andrew jackson jr except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members personal life family jackson had three adopted sons theodore an indian about whom little is known andrew jackson jr the son of rachels brother severn donelson and lyncoya a creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july   at the age of sixteen the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children john samuel donelson daniel smith donelson and andrew jackson donelson were the sons of rachels brother samuel donelson who died in  andrew jackson hutchings was rachels orphaned grand nephew caroline butler eliza butler edward butler and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler a family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachels niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jacksons private secretary and in  ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over a year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became cohostess of the white house in  it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in  jackson used rip raps as a retreat temperament tennessee gentleman portrait of jackson c  from the collection of the hermitage jacksons quick temper was notorious biographer h w brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his bloodcurdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record—in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of the presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c calhoun reminiwho is of the opinion that jackson was often in control of his rage and that he used it along with his fearsome reputation as a tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was a lean figure standing at  feet  inch  m tall and weighing between  and  pounds  kg on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age  he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and a hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in  jackson became a member of the first presbyterian church in nashville jackson was a freemason initiated at harmony lodge no  in tennessee he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee he was the only us president to have served as grand master of a states grand lodge until harry s truman in  his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage legacy and memory historical reputation equestrian statue of gen jackson jackson county courthouse kansas city missouri commissioned by judge harry s truman jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jacksons masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage his most controversial presidential actions included removal of the indians from the southeast the dismantling of the bank of the united states and his threat to use military force against the state of south carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the british at new orleans in the last battle of the war of  he was the main founder of the modern democratic party and became its iconic hero he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies jackson was criticised by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law “ far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demands—say rather anticipates and forestalls them  general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly ” — alexis de tocqueville democracy in america  volume i chapter xviii brands observes that jacksons reputation declined after the midth century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears on a more favorable note remini argues that jacksonian democracystretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workableas such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history—populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson–jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse  bill jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as  and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the    and  note most recently his image appears on the us  federal reserve note series  with a redesigned larger portrait in  treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by  an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the  banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on  different us postage stamps only george washington abraham lincoln and benjamin franklin have appeared more often he first appeared on an  cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a cent red stamp and the other a cent green stamp both issued in  memorials main article list of memorials to andrew jackson the tomb of andrew and rachel jackson located at the hermitage numerous counties and

brothers lived with jacksons aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jacksons exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying jacksons father the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in  jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncles plantation in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of  which he opposed in the mids secondhand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina revolutionary war service young jackson refusing to clean major

mother legal career and marriage after the revolutionary war jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school in  he worked for a time in a saddlemakers shop on bad terms with much of his extended family he boarded with several different people while teaching school or working for the saddlemaker in  he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under

at the time the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in  according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in  to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and founding of memphis further information history of memphis tennessee in  jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter john overton overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw theirs was a frank avowal they like many of their contemporaries would deal with lands within indian territory most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of  that briefly opened to claim by north carolinians all of the indian lands in that states transmontane west he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in  early political career and tennessee militia after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state jackson became attorney general in  and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in  when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its us representative the following year the state legislature elected him as us senator he resigned within a year while in philadelphia then the nations capital jackson aligned himself with the democraticrepublican party and he strongly opposed the jay treaty in  with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of  jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making due to financial troubles jackson resigned the judgeship in  and returned fulltime to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia while serving on the tennessee supreme court he was appointed in  as a colonel in the tennessee militia in  he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers jackson with strong support from western tennessee tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february  governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence against sevier of land fraud subsequently in  when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier responded with hostility to jackson and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until  sevier took revenge on jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts and giving jackson control of only the west planting career and controversy notice of reward offered by jackson for return of an enslaved slave in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in  the next year he acquired the hermitage a acre  ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added  acres  ha to the plantation which eventually totaled  acres  ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves—jackson began with nine owned as many as  by  and later up to  making him among the planter elite jackson also coowned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed  slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as  slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in footsquare cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profitmaking enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wifes honor by may  charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in tennessee who called it a brutal coldblooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man as a result he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in  went on a tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements on october   jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at a moments warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas but all spanish north america he continued i have a hope should their be a call that at least two thousand volunteers can be lead into the field at a short notice—that number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprise—i think could look into santafee and maxico—give freedom and commerce to those provinces and establish peace and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers on our interior—which will be the case so long as spain holds that large country on our borders jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november  he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to numerous officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burrs behalf the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jeffersons efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed james monroe for president in  against james madison who was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democraticrepublican party military career war of  creek campaign and treaty main article creek war portrait by ralph e w earl c  leading up to  the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized but tensions with britain increased on account of a number of causes mainly these were britains persistent impressment of us sailors and interference with maritime trade during the napoleonic warswhich were seen as an offense against american honor and as a refusal to recognize american independence the encouragement of indian raids against american settlements and the desire of many americans for more land particularly british canada and florida the latter still controlled by spain britains european ally on june   congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland beginning the war of  jackson responded enthusiastically sending a letter to washington offering  volunteers however the men were not called up for many months biographer robert v remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support for burr and monroe meanwhile the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield on january   jackson led an army of  volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks he was to serve under general wilkinson who commanded federal forces in new orleans however lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez now part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent a letter to jackson dated february  ordering him dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march  jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies however he also promised to instead of dismissing the troops in natchez march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill according to remini jackson ordered his officers to turn over their horses to the sick and he surrendered his own three horses for the duty trudging along his men day after day never showing weariness or fatigue he cheered the men with a word a gesture a sign of pride in them he paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket the soldiers began referring to their commander as hickory because of his toughness and jackson would eventually become known as old hickory the army marched on average  miles per day and arrived in nashville within about a month jacksons actions earned him the widespread respect and praise of the people of tennessee on june  jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer william carroll against jesse benton in september jackson and his top cavalry officer brigadier general john coffee were involved in a street brawl with jesse and his brother thomas jackson

the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek jacksons troops repelled the attackers but outnumbered were forced to withdraw to fort strother jackson now with over  troops marched most of his army south to confront the red sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the tallapoosa river on march  enjoying an advantage of more than  to  he engaged them at the battle of horseshoe bend an initial artillery barrage did little damage to the wellconstructed fort however a subsequent infantry charge in addition to an assault by coffees cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly creeks overwhelmed the red sticks the campaign ended three weeks later with red eagles surrender although some red sticks such as mcqueen fled to east florida on june  jackson accepted a commission as brigadier general in the united states army and  days later he became a major general in command of the seventh military division subsequently jackson with madisons approval imposed the treaty of fort jackson the treaty required the muscogee including those who had not joined the red sticks to surrender  million acres of land to the united states though in illhealth from dysentery jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas the first charge was true while the second ignored the fact that it was jacksons threats to invade florida which caused them to seek british protection in the november  battle of pensacola jackson defeated british and spanish forces in a short skirmish the spanish surrendered and the british fled weeks later he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which sat on the mouth of the mississippi river and held immense strategic and commercial value jackson abandoned pensacola to the spanish placed a force in mobile alabama to guard against a possible invasion there

against monroes orders and violated the constitution since the united states had not declared war upon spain yet jackson was defended by secretary of state john quincy adams adams thought that jacksons conquest of florida would force spain to finally sell the province and spain did indeed sell florida to the united states in the adams–onís treaty of  a congressional investigation exonerated

tennessee jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state but accepted john overtons plan to have the legislature nominate him for president jackson had come to detest secretary of the treasury william h crawford who had been the most vocal critic of jackson in monroes cabinet and he hoped to prevent tennessees electoral votes from going to crawford yet jacksons nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of  had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democraticrepublican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions in  jackson allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats and the legislature narrowly elected him his return after  years  months  days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history democraticrepublican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses but this method had become unpopular in  most of the democraticrepublicans in congress boycotted the caucus those who attended backed treasury secretary william h crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin criticized jackson as an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory but from incapacity military habits and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions altogether unfit for the office after jackson won the pennsylvania nomination calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead in the presidential election jackson won a plurality of the electoral vote taking several southern and western states as well as the midatlantic states of pennsylvania and new jersey he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking  percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won  electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of  which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral votewinners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federallyfunded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on the first ballot furious supporters of jackson accused clay and adams of having reached a corrupt bargain after adams appointed clay as his secretary of state after the election jackson resigned his senate seat and returned to tennessee election of  and death of rachel jackson  electoral college results main articles united states presidential election  and andrew jackson presidential campaign

fact that jacksons supporters began the  campaign almost as soon as the  campaign ended adamss presidency floundered as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics senator martin van buren who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in the  election emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adamss policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in the  election van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who also opposed much of adamss agenda van buren and other jackson allies established numerous projackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won a commanding  percent of the popular vote and  percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the oneparty era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy the accusation was technically true it was based on the legal status of rachels marriage and divorce from her former husband many years prior  to  jacksons campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for the czar they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and she never did well when jackson was away at war or work

president andrew jackson new york ritchie  co  jacksons name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jacksons philosophy as president was similar to that of thomas jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generationjackson took a moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and a limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people when selecting his cabinet instead of choosing party favorites jackson selected plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose martin van buren of new york as secretary of state john eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip inauguration main article first inauguration of andrew jackson on march   andrew jackson became the first united states presidentelect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the us capitol in his inaugural speech jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency he also promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair main article petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president john c calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war john h eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state martin van buren a widower was already forming a coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton in the spring of  jackson at van burens suggestion demanded the resignations of all the cabinet member except postmaster general william t barry van buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias in  jackson nominated van buren to be minister to england calhoun blocked the nomination with a tiebreaking vote against it claiming the defeated nomination would kill him sir kill dead he will never kick sir never kick van buren

presidency marked a new era in indiananglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency jackson painted by earl  in his december   first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may   congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they

misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in  refused to move in december  this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in  members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in  agreeing to move their tribe however the creeks later resisted leading to a second creek war the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the  supreme court decision in worcester v georgia in that decision us supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries also the court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor president martin van buren who sent  troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began subsequently as many as  cherokees died on the trail of tears in  more than  american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in  after a group of indians crossed into us territory jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting around  jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left such as howard zinn often on this issue zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in  francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the very hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini argues that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribesnamely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move reforms rotation of offices and spoils system further information spoils system filejackson andrewpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of jackson as president in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the postal service jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vicepresident to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress jacksons time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of  for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need while an act of july  enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in  jackson established the tenhour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed earlier by president monroe in  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing fathertoson succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about  of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency nullification crisis main article nullification crisis in  congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the issue nonetheless came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of  secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of  although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident was at the april   jefferson day dinner involving afterdinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved – a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may  jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure thengeneral jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in  while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february  the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november  established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the democratic party on july   jackson signed into law the tariff of  it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but the nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november  the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of  and the tariff of  in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december   with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina in december  jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution  forms a government not a league  to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nation jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by clay agreed to a reduced compromise tariff the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march   and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may   jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs jacksons minister to france william c rives successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with france in  addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office in  spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july   that would award the us ₣   in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by  the nonpayment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december  state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for nonpayment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december  state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february  american reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased  while imports increased  jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for  failed the chargé daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in  the texas revolution began when proslavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may  they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an antislavery issue during the  election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a chargé daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march   jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade with china and japan he was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america bank veto and election of  main articles bank war banking in the jacksonian era and united states presidential election   electoral college results  democratic cartoon shows jackson destroying the devils bank the  presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december  nominated henry clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the antimasonic party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september  nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons in  the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of  in  president james monroe appointed nicholas biddle the banks third and last executive to run the bank clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers in january  biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the banks charter four years before the original year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june  and the house on july   jackson believing that bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners vetoed the bill on july  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes clay received  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the antimasonic party folded jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in  jackson attempted to began removing federal deposits from the bank whose moneylending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately probank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger b taney a strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic intended to force jackson into a compromise the move backfired increasing antibank sentiment in  those who opposed jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy a movement emerged amongst whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jacksonrival senator henry clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march  the senate voted to censure jackson – it also rejected taney as treasury secretary finally on january   when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in  in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes causing the panic of  the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the thcentury cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in  had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrences attempt on jacksons life as depicted in an  etching the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may   jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january   what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically richard iii dead since —and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life however his suspicions were never proven antislavery tracts during the summer of  northern abolitionists began sending antislavery tracts through the us postal system into the south proslavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary some rioting also broke out jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the  election jackson also fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the antislavery tracts he subsequently called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition uss porpoise a brig ship laid down in  and launched in may  by secretary of navy dickerson used in the us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from  to  led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in  but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in  he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to thomas jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may   jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until  during the presidency of van buren one brig ship uss porpoise later used in the expedition having been laid down built and commissioned by secretary dickerson in may  circumnavigated the world explored and mapped the southern ocean confirming the existence of the antarctica continent panic

bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills in january  jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished however reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the panic of  contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in  and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in  that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in  contributed to the panic of  the specie circular that mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act that transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until  when the economy began to

jackson retired to his hermitage plantation in  and immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of  he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until  during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the  presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats during jacksons campaigns they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of james k polk of tennessee for vice president at the  democratic national convention over unpopular incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered however harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler was known to act as an independent and not be bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whig party in  when he vetoed two whigsponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing great satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up antislavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to reconquer the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially jackson again supported van buren for president in  and polk for vice president when a letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public van buren was moved into writing the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south jackson then threw his support behind polk for the nomination at the  democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required twothirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for reelection as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president with jacksons support polk won the  presidential election narrowly defeating the whig nominee henry clay a bill of annexation was finally signed by tyler on march   jackson died at his plantation on june   at the age of  of chronic tuberculosis dropsy and heart failure according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed  but he subsequently revived  gen jackson died

butler and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler a family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachels niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jacksons private secretary and in  ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over a year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white

sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in  jackson used rip raps as a retreat temperament tennessee gentleman portrait of jackson c  from the collection of the hermitage jacksons quick temper was notorious biographer h w brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his bloodcurdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record—in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of the presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c calhoun reminiwho is of the opinion that jackson was often in control of his rage and that he used it along with his fearsome reputation as a tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was a lean figure standing at  feet  inch  m tall and weighing between  and  pounds  kg on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age  he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and a hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in  jackson became a member of the first presbyterian church in nashville jackson was a freemason initiated at harmony lodge no  in tennessee he also participated in chartering several

commissioned by judge harry s truman jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jacksons masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage his most controversial presidential actions included removal of the indians from the southeast the dismantling of the bank of the united states and his threat to use military force against the state of south carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the british at new orleans in the last battle of the war of  he was the main founder of the modern democratic party and became its iconic hero he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies jackson was criticised by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law “ far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demands—say rather anticipates and forestalls them  general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly ” — alexis de tocqueville democracy in america  volume i chapter xviii brands observes that jacksons reputation declined after the midth century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears on a more favorable note remini argues that jacksonian democracystretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workableas such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history—populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson–jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse  bill jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as  and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the    and  note most recently his image appears on the us  federal reserve note series  with a redesigned larger portrait in  treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by  an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the  banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on  different us postage stamps only george washington abraham lincoln and benjamin franklin have appeared more often he first appeared on an  cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a cent red stamp and the other a cent green stamp both issued in  memorials main article list of memorials to andrew jackson the tomb of andrew and rachel jackson located at the hermitage numerous counties and

the village of boneybefore also in county antrim his paternal family line originated in killingswold grove yorkshire england when they immigrated to north america in  jacksons parents probably landed in philadelphia most likely they traveled overland through the appalachian mountains to the scotsirish community in the waxhaws region straddling the border between north and south carolina they brought two children from ireland hugh born  and robert born  jacksons father died in an accident in february  at the age of  three weeks before his son andrew was born jackson his mother and his brothers lived with jacksons aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jacksons exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying jacksons father the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in  jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncles plantation in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of  which he opposed in the mids secondhand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina revolutionary war service young jackson refusing to clean major coffins boots  lithograph during the revolutionary war jacksons eldest brother hugh died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june   antibritish sentiment intensified following the brutal waxhaws massacre on may   jacksons mother encouraged him and his elder brother robert to attend the local militia drills soon they began to help the militia as couriers they served under colonel william richardson davie at the battle of hanging rock on august  andrew and robert were eventually captured by the british in  while staying at the home of the crawford family when andrew refused to clean the boots of a british officer the officer slashed at the youth with a sword leaving him with scars on his left hand and head as well as an intense hatred for the british robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword the two brothers were held as prisoners contracted smallpox and nearly starved to death in captivity robert jackson died on april   a few days after their mother elizabeth secured the brothers release after nursing andrew back to health she volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in the charleston harbor where there had been an outbreak of cholera in november she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave andrew became an orphan at age  he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother legal career and marriage after the revolutionary war jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school in  he worked for a time in a saddlemakers shop on bad terms with much of his extended family he boarded with several different people while teaching school or working for the saddlemaker in  he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under attorney spruce macay with the help of various lawyers he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar in september  jackson was admitted to the north carolina bar shortly thereafter a friend helped jackson get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the western district of north carolina which would later become the state of tennessee during his travel west jackson bought his first slave and in  having been offended by fellow lawyer waightstill avery fought his first duel the duel ended with both men firing into the air having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement jackson moved to nashville in  where he lived as a boarder with rachel stockly donelson the widow of john donelson here jackson became acquainted with their daughter rachel donelson robards at the time the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in  according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in  to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and founding of memphis further information history of memphis tennessee in  jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter john overton overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw theirs was a frank avowal they like many of their contemporaries would deal with lands within indian territory most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of  that briefly opened to claim by north carolinians all of the indian lands in that states transmontane west he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in  early political career and tennessee militia after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state jackson became attorney general in  and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in  when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its us representative the following year the state legislature elected him as us senator he resigned within a year while in philadelphia then the nations capital jackson aligned himself with the democraticrepublican party and he strongly opposed the jay treaty in  with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of  jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making due to financial troubles jackson resigned the judgeship in  and returned fulltime to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia while serving on the tennessee supreme court he was appointed in  as a colonel in the tennessee militia in  he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers jackson with strong support from western tennessee tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february  governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence against sevier of land fraud subsequently in  when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier responded with hostility to jackson and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until  sevier took revenge on jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts and giving jackson control of only the west planting career and controversy notice of reward offered by jackson for return of an enslaved slave in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in  the next year he acquired the hermitage a acre  ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added  acres  ha to the plantation which eventually totaled  acres  ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves—jackson began with nine owned as many as  by  and later up to  making him among the planter elite jackson also coowned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed  slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as  slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in footsquare cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profitmaking enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wifes honor by may  charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in tennessee who called it a brutal coldblooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man as a result he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in  went on a tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements on october   jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at a moments warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas but all spanish north america he continued i have a hope should their be a call that at least two thousand volunteers can be lead into the field at a short notice—that number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprise—i think could look into santafee and maxico—give freedom and commerce to those provinces and establish peace and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers on our interior—which will be the case so long as spain holds that large country on our borders jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november  he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to numerous officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burrs behalf the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jeffersons efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed james monroe for president in  against james madison who was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democraticrepublican party military career war of  creek campaign and treaty main article creek war portrait by ralph e w earl c  leading up to  the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized but tensions with britain increased on account of a number of causes mainly these were britains persistent impressment of us sailors and interference with maritime trade during the napoleonic warswhich were seen as an offense against american honor and as a refusal to recognize american independence the encouragement of indian raids against american settlements and the desire of many americans for more land particularly british canada and florida the latter still controlled by spain britains european ally on june   congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland beginning the war of  jackson responded enthusiastically sending a letter to washington offering  volunteers however the men were not called up for many months biographer robert v remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support for burr and monroe meanwhile the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield on january   jackson led an army of  volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks he was to serve under general wilkinson who commanded federal forces in new orleans however lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez now part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent a letter to jackson dated february  ordering him dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march  jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies however he also promised to instead of dismissing the troops in natchez march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill according to remini jackson ordered his officers to turn over their horses to the sick and he surrendered his own three horses for the duty trudging along his men day after day never showing weariness or fatigue he cheered the men with a word a gesture a sign of pride in them he paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket the soldiers began referring to their commander as hickory because of his toughness and jackson would eventually become known as old hickory the army marched on average  miles per day and arrived in nashville within about a month jacksons actions earned him the widespread respect and praise of the people of tennessee on june  jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer william carroll against jesse benton in september jackson and his top cavalry officer brigadier general john coffee were involved in a street brawl with jesse and his brother thomas jackson was severely wounded by jesse with a gunshot to the shoulder on august   a group of muscogee also known as creek indians called the red sticks so named for the color of their war paint perpetrated the fort mims massacre the red sticks led by chiefs red eagle and peter mcqueen had broken away from the rest of the creek confederacy which wanted peace with the united states they were allied with

ordered to crush the hostile indians on october  he set out on the expedition his arm still in a sling jackson established fort strother as a supply base on november  coffee defeated a band of red sticks at the battle of tallushatchee coming to the relief of friendly creeks besieged by red sticks jackson won another decisive victory at the battle of talladega in the winter jackson encamped at fort strother faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions he sent coffee with the cavalry which abandoned him back to tennessee to secure more enlistments jackson decided to combine his force with that of the georgia militia however from january   while on their way the tennessee militia and allied muscogee were attacked by the red sticks at the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek jacksons troops repelled the attackers but outnumbered were forced to withdraw to fort strother jackson now with over  troops marched most of his army south to confront the red sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the tallapoosa river on march  enjoying an advantage of more than  to  he engaged them at the battle of horseshoe bend an initial artillery barrage did little damage to the wellconstructed fort however a subsequent infantry charge in addition to an assault by coffees cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly creeks overwhelmed the red sticks the campaign ended three weeks later with red eagles surrender although some red sticks such as mcqueen fled to east florida on june  jackson accepted a commission as brigadier general in the united states army and  days later he became a major general in command of the seventh military division subsequently jackson with madisons approval imposed the treaty of fort jackson the treaty required the muscogee including those who had not joined the red sticks to surrender  million acres of land to the united states though in illhealth from dysentery jackson turned his attention to defeating spanish and british forces jackson accused the spanish of arming the red sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing british soldiers into the floridas the first charge was true while the second ignored the fact that it was jacksons threats to invade florida which caused them to seek british protection in the november  battle of pensacola jackson defeated british and spanish forces in a short skirmish the spanish surrendered and the british fled weeks later he learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which sat on the mouth of the mississippi river and held immense strategic and commercial value jackson abandoned pensacola to the spanish placed a force in mobile alabama to guard against a possible invasion there and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city the creeks coined their own name for jackson jacksa chula harjo or jackson old and fierce battle of new orleans main article battle of new

lafittes smugglers and formed military units consisting of africanamericans and muscogees jackson received some criticism for paying whites and nonwhites the same salary these forces along with us army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states joined with jacksons force in defending new orleans the approaching british force led by admiral alexander cochrane and later general edward pakenham consisted of over  soldiers many of whom had served in the napoleonic wars jackson only had about  men the british arrived on the east bank of the mississippi river on the morning of december

recollection of a victory which he gained twenty years ago under the walls of new orleans enforced martial law in new orleans jackson ordered the arrest of u s district court judge dominic a hall in march  after the judge signed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a louisiana legislator whom jackson had arrested state senator louis louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the new orleans

state judge joshua lewis lewis was simultaneously serving under jackson in the militia and also had signed a writ of habeas corpus against jackson his commanding officer seeking judge halls release

community of escaped slaves and their descendants jackson was ordered by president james monroe in december  to lead a campaign in georgia against the seminole and creek indians jackson was also charged with preventing spanish florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves after spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves critics later alleged that jackson exceeded orders in his florida actions his orders from president monroe were to terminate the conflict jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize florida from spain once and for all before departing jackson wrote to

arbuthnot after a brief trial jackson executed both british agents causing a diplomatic incident with the british jacksons actions polarized monroes cabinet some of whom argued that jackson had gone against monroes orders and violated the constitution since the united states had not declared war upon spain yet jackson was defended by secretary of state john quincy adams adams thought that jacksons conquest of florida would force spain to finally sell the province and spain did indeed sell florida to the united states in the adams–onís treaty of  a congressional investigation exonerated

garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of  had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democraticrepublican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions in  jackson allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats and the legislature narrowly elected him his return after  years  months  days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history democraticrepublican presidential

irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin criticized jackson as an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory but from incapacity military habits and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions altogether unfit for the office after jackson won the pennsylvania nomination calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead in the presidential election jackson won a plurality of the electoral vote taking several southern and western states as well as the midatlantic states of pennsylvania and new jersey he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking  percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won  electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of  which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral votewinners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federallyfunded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on the first ballot furious supporters of jackson accused clay and adams of having reached a corrupt bargain after adams appointed clay as his secretary of state after the election jackson resigned his

jackson was nominated for president by tennessee legislature in october  more than three years before the  election it was the earliest such nomination in presidential history and it attested to the fact that jacksons supporters began the  campaign almost as soon as the  campaign ended adamss presidency floundered as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics senator martin van buren who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in the  election emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adamss policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in the  election van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who also opposed much of adamss agenda van buren and other jackson allies established numerous projackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won a commanding  percent of the popular vote and  percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the oneparty era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy the accusation was technically true it was based on the legal status of rachels marriage and divorce from her former husband many years prior  to  jacksons campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for the czar they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and she never did well when jackson was away at war or work jackson blamed john quincy adams because adamss supporters had repeatedly attacked the circumstances for jacksons wedding to rachel jackson described her symptoms as excruciating pain in the left shoulder arm and breast after struggling for three days rachel finally died of a heart attack on december   three weeks after her husbands victory in the election which began on october  and ended on december  and  weeks before jackson took office as president a distraught jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body he felt that adams accusations had hastened her

president andrew jackson new york ritchie  co  jacksons name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jacksons philosophy as president was similar to that of thomas jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generationjackson took a moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and a limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people when selecting his cabinet instead of choosing party favorites jackson selected plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose martin van buren of new york as secretary of state john eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved to be unsuccessful full of bitter partisanship and gossip inauguration main article first inauguration of andrew jackson on march   andrew jackson became the first united states presidentelect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the us capitol in his inaugural speech jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency he also promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair main article petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president john c calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war john h eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state martin van buren a widower was already forming a coalition against calhoun he could now see his main chance to strike hard he took the side of jackson and eaton in the spring of  jackson at van burens suggestion demanded the resignations of all the cabinet member except postmaster general william t barry van buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias in  jackson nominated van buren to

however fully recovered and played a leading role in the jacksons unofficial kitchen cabinet indian removal policy further information indian removal indian removal act and trail of tears jacksons indian removal act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several indian tribes from their traditional territories including the trail of tears since jackson was a military commander he had played a prominent role in indian relations throughout his eight years in office jackson made about  treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jacksons presidency marked a new era in indiananglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency jackson painted by earl  in his december   first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may   congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of  and  and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in  refused to move in december  this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in  members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in  agreeing to move their tribe however the creeks later resisted leading to a second creek war the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the  supreme court decision in worcester v georgia in that decision us supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries also the court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor president martin van buren who sent  troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began subsequently as many as  cherokees died on the trail of tears in  more than  american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in  after a group of indians crossed into us territory jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting around  jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left such as howard zinn often on this issue zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in  francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the very hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini argues that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribesnamely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move reforms rotation of offices and spoils system further information spoils system filejackson andrewpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of jackson as president in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the postal service jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vicepresident to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress jacksons time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of  for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need while an act of july  enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in  jackson established the tenhour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed earlier by president monroe in  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing fathertoson succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about  of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency nullification crisis main article nullification crisis in  congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the issue nonetheless came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of  secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of  although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident was at the april   jefferson day dinner involving afterdinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved – a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may  jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure thengeneral jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in  while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february  the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november  established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the democratic party on july   jackson signed into law the tariff of  it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but the nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november  the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of  and the tariff of  in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december   with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina in december  jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution  forms a government not a league  to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nation jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by clay agreed to a reduced compromise tariff the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march   and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may   jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs jacksons minister to france william c rives successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with france in  addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office in  spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july   that would award the us ₣   in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by  the nonpayment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december  state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for nonpayment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december  state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february  american reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased  while imports increased  jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for  failed the chargé daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in  the texas revolution began when proslavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may  they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an antislavery issue during the  election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a chargé daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march   jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade with china and japan he was unsuccessful at thwarting great britains presence and power in south america bank veto and election of  main articles bank war banking in the jacksonian era and united states presidential election   electoral college results  democratic cartoon shows jackson destroying the devils bank the  presidential election demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president van buren the national republican party who had held their first convention in baltimore earlier in december  nominated henry clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania the antimasonic party which had earlier held its convention also in baltimore in september  nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania both jackson and clay were masons in  the second bank of the united states was chartered by president james madison to restore the united states economy devastated by the war of  in  president james monroe appointed nicholas biddle the banks third and last executive to run the bank clay hoped to make the bank an issue in the election so as to accuse jackson of going beyond his powers in january  biddle submitted to congress a renewal of the banks charter four years before the original year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june  and the house on july   jackson believing that bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners vetoed the bill on july  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes clay received  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the antimasonic party folded jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in  jackson attempted to began removing federal deposits from the bank whose moneylending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately probank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger b taney a strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic intended to force jackson into a compromise the move backfired increasing antibank sentiment in  those who opposed jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy a movement emerged amongst whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jacksonrival senator henry clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march  the senate voted to censure jackson – it also rejected taney as treasury secretary finally on january   when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in  in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes causing the panic of  the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the thcentury cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in  had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrences attempt on jacksons life as depicted in an  etching the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may   jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january   what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically richard iii dead since —and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life however his suspicions were never proven antislavery tracts during the summer of  northern abolitionists began sending antislavery tracts through the us postal system into the south proslavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary some rioting also broke out jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the  election jackson also fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the antislavery tracts he subsequently called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition uss porpoise a brig ship laid down in  and launched in may  by secretary of navy dickerson used in the us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from  to  led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in  but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in  he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to thomas jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may   jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until  during the presidency of van buren one brig ship uss porpoise later used in the expedition

bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills in january  jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished however reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the panic of  contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in  and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in  that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in  contributed to the panic of  the specie circular that mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act that transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt

jackson remained influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of  he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until  during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the  presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats during jacksons campaigns they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of james k polk of tennessee for vice president at the  democratic national convention over unpopular incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered however harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler was known to act as an independent and not be bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whig party in  when he vetoed two whigsponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing great satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up antislavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to reconquer the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially jackson again supported van buren for president in  and polk for vice president when a letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public van buren was moved into writing the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south jackson then threw his support behind polk for the nomination at the  democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required twothirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for reelection as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president with jacksons support polk won the  presidential election narrowly defeating the whig nominee henry clay a bill of annexation was finally signed by tyler on march   jackson died at his plantation on june   at the age of  of chronic tuberculosis dropsy and heart failure according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed  but he subsequently revived  gen jackson died at the hermitage at  oclock pm on sunday the th instant  when the messenger finally came the old soldier patriot and christian was looking out for his approach he is gone but his memory lives and will continue to live in his will jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son andrew jackson jr except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members personal life family jackson had three adopted sons theodore an indian about whom little is known andrew jackson jr the son of rachels brother severn donelson and lyncoya a creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july   at the age of sixteen the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children john samuel donelson daniel smith donelson and andrew jackson donelson were the sons of rachels brother samuel donelson who died in  andrew jackson hutchings was rachels orphaned grand nephew caroline butler eliza butler edward butler and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler a family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachels niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jacksons private secretary and in  ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over a year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became cohostess of the white house in  it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in  jackson used rip raps as a retreat temperament tennessee gentleman portrait of jackson c  from the collection of the hermitage jacksons quick temper was notorious biographer h w brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his bloodcurdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record—in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of the presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c calhoun reminiwho is of the opinion that jackson was often in control of his rage and that he used it along with his fearsome reputation as a tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was a lean figure standing at  feet  inch  m tall and weighing between  and  pounds  kg on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age  he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and a hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in  jackson became a member of the first presbyterian church in nashville jackson was a freemason initiated at harmony lodge no  in tennessee he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee he was the only us president to have served as grand master of a states grand lodge until harry s truman in  his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage legacy and memory historical reputation equestrian statue of gen jackson jackson county courthouse kansas city missouri commissioned by judge harry s truman jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jacksons masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage his most controversial presidential actions included removal of the indians from the southeast the dismantling of the bank of the united states and his threat to use military force against the state of south carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the british at new orleans in the last battle of the war of  he was the main founder of the modern democratic party and became its iconic hero he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies jackson was criticised by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law “ far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demands—say rather anticipates and forestalls them  general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly ” — alexis de tocqueville democracy in america  volume i chapter xviii brands observes that jacksons reputation declined after the midth century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears on a more favorable note remini argues that jacksonian democracystretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workableas such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history—populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson–jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse  bill jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as  and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the    and  note most recently his image appears on the us  federal reserve note series  with a redesigned larger portrait in  treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by  an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the  banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on  different us postage stamps only george washington abraham lincoln and benjamin franklin have appeared more often he first appeared on an  cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a cent red stamp and the other a cent green stamp both issued in  memorials main article list of memorials to andrew jackson the tomb of andrew and rachel jackson located at the hermitage numerous counties and cities are named after him including the city of jacksonville in florida and north carolina the city of jackson in louisiana michigan mississippi missouri and tennessee jackson county in florida illinois mississippi missouri ohio and oregon and jackson parish in louisiana memorials to jackson include a set of four identical equestrian statues by the sculptor clark mills in lafayette square washington dc in jackson square new orleans in nashville on the grounds of the tennessee state capitol and in jacksonville florida other equestrian statues of jackson have been erected elsewhere as in the state capitol grounds in raleigh north carolina that statue controversially identifies him as one of the presidents north carolina gave the nation and he is featured alongside james polk and andrew johnson both us presidents born in north carolina there is a bust of andrew jackson in plaza ferdinand vii in pensacola florida where he became the first governor of the florida territory in  popular culture depictions jackson and his wife rachel were the main subjects of a  historical novel by irving stone the presidents lady which told the story of their lives up until rachels death the novel was the basis for the  film of the same name starring charlton heston as jackson and susan hayward as rachel jackson has been a supporting character in a number of historical films and television productions lionel barrymore played jackson in the gorgeous hussy  a fictionalized biography of peggy eaton starring joan crawford the buccaneer  depicting the battle of new orleans

jackson presbyterians who had emigrated from northern ireland two years earlier jacksons father was born in carrickfergus county antrim in currentday northern ireland around  jacksons parents lived in the village of boneybefore also in county antrim his paternal family line originated in killingswold grove yorkshire england when they immigrated to north america in  jacksons parents probably landed in philadelphia most likely they traveled overland through the appalachian mountains to the scotsirish community in the waxhaws region straddling the border between north and south carolina they brought two children from ireland hugh born  and robert born  jacksons father died in an accident in february  at the age of  three weeks before his son andrew was born jackson his mother and his brothers lived with jacksons aunt and uncle in the waxhaws region and jackson received schooling from two nearby priests jacksons exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying jacksons father the area was so remote that the border between north and south carolina had not been officially surveyed in  jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncles plantation in lancaster county south carolina jackson may have claimed to be a south carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the tariff of  which he opposed in the mids secondhand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncles home in north carolina revolutionary war service young jackson refusing to clean major coffins boots  lithograph during the revolutionary war jacksons eldest brother hugh died from heat exhaustion after the battle of stono ferry on june   antibritish sentiment intensified following the brutal waxhaws massacre on may   jacksons mother encouraged him and his elder brother robert to attend the local militia drills soon they began to help the militia as couriers they served under colonel william richardson davie at the battle of hanging rock on august  andrew and robert were eventually captured by the british in  while staying at the home of the crawford family when andrew refused to clean the boots of a british officer the officer slashed at the youth with a sword leaving him with scars on his left hand and head as well as an intense hatred for the british robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword the two brothers were held as prisoners contracted smallpox and nearly starved to death in captivity robert jackson died on april   a few days after their mother elizabeth secured the brothers release after nursing andrew back to health she volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in the charleston harbor where there had been an outbreak of cholera in november she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave andrew became an orphan at age  he blamed the british personally for the loss of his brothers and mother legal career and marriage after the revolutionary war jackson received a sporadic education in a local waxhaw school in  he worked for a time in a saddlemakers shop on bad terms with much of his extended family he boarded with several different people while teaching school or working for the saddlemaker in  he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under attorney spruce macay with the help of various lawyers he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar in september  jackson was admitted to the north carolina bar shortly thereafter a friend helped jackson get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the western district of north carolina which would later become the state of tennessee during his travel west jackson bought his first slave and in  having been offended by fellow lawyer waightstill avery fought his first duel the duel ended with both men firing into the air having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement jackson moved to nashville in  where he lived as a boarder with rachel stockly donelson the widow of john donelson here jackson became acquainted with their daughter rachel donelson robards at the time the younger rachel was in an unhappy marriage with captain lewis robards he was subject to fits of jealous rage the two were separated in  according to jackson he married rachel after hearing that robards had obtained a divorce however the divorce had never been completed making rachels marriage to jackson bigamous and therefore invalid after the divorce was officially completed rachel and jackson remarried in  to complicate matters further evidence shows that rachel had been living with jackson and referred to herself as mrs jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made it was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially as long as they were recognized by the community land speculation and founding of memphis further information history of memphis tennessee in  jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter john overton overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the cherokee and chickasaw theirs was a frank avowal they like many of their contemporaries would deal with lands within indian territory most of the transactions involved grants made under the land grab act of  that briefly opened to claim by north carolinians all of the indian lands in that states transmontane west he was one of the three original investors who founded memphis tennessee in  early political career and tennessee militia after moving to nashville jackson became a protege of william blount a friend of the donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state jackson became attorney general in  and he won election as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in  when tennessee achieved statehood that year he was elected its us representative the following year the state legislature elected him as us senator he resigned within a year while in philadelphia then the nations capital jackson aligned himself with the democraticrepublican party and he strongly opposed the jay treaty in  with strong support from western tennessee he was elected to serve as a judge of the tennessee supreme court at an annual salary of  jacksons service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making due to financial troubles jackson resigned the judgeship in  and returned fulltime to his business interests after arriving in tennessee jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the tennessee militia while serving on the tennessee supreme court he was appointed in  as a colonel in the tennessee militia in  he declared his candidacy for major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position voted on by the officers jackson with strong support from western tennessee tied with john sevier with seventeen votes sevier was a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor the recognized leader of politics in eastern tennessee on february  governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor jackson had also presented roane with evidence against sevier of land fraud subsequently in  when sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship roane released the evidence sevier responded with hostility to jackson and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter despite the charges leveled against sevier he defeated roane and continued to serve as governor until  sevier took revenge on jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts and giving jackson control of only the west planting career and controversy notice of reward offered by jackson for return of an enslaved slave in addition to his legal and political career jackson prospered as planter slave owner and merchant he built a home and the first general store in gallatin tennessee in  the next year he acquired the hermitage a acre  ha plantation in davidson county near nashville he later added  acres  ha to the plantation which eventually totaled  acres  ha the primary crop was cotton grown by slaves—jackson began with nine owned as many as  by  and later up to  making him among the planter elite jackson also coowned with his son andrew jackson jr the halcyon plantation in coahoma county mississippi which housed  slaves at the time of his death throughout his lifetime jackson may have owned as many as  slaves men women and child slaves were owned by jackson on three sections of the hermitage plantation slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in footsquare cabins made either of brick or logs the size and quality of the hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times to help slaves acquire food jackson supplied them with guns knives and fishing equipment at times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets the hermitage plantation was a profitmaking enterprise jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves offenses were severe enough at various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation for the standards of his times jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children the controversy surrounding his marriage to rachel remained a sore point for jackson who deeply resented attacks on his wifes honor by may  charles dickinson who like jackson raced horses had published an attack on jackson in the local newspaper and it resulted in a written challenge from jackson to a duel since dickinson was considered an expert shot jackson determined it would be best to let dickinson turn and fire first hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness jackson would wait and take careful aim at dickinson dickinson did fire first hitting jackson in the chest the bullet that struck jackson was so close to his heart that it was never safely removed under the rules of dueling dickinson had to remain still as jackson took aim and shot and killed him jacksons behavior in the duel outraged men of honor in tennessee who called it a brutal coldblooded killing and saddled jackson with a reputation as a violent vengeful man as a result he became a social outcast after the sevier affair and the duel jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation he chose to align himself with former vice president aaron burr who after leaving office in  went on a tour of the western united states during that time he stayed for several days at the hermitage burrs true intentions are not known with certainty he seems to have been planning a military operation to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas to many westerners like jackson the promise seemed enticing western american settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the spanish to keep indians living on their lands from raiding american settlements on october   jackson addressed the tennessee militia declaring that the men should be at a moments warning ready to march on the same day he wrote to james winchester proclaiming that the united states can conquer not only the floridas but all spanish north america he continued i have a hope should their be a call that at least two thousand volunteers can be lead into the field at a short notice—that number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprise—i think could look into santafee and maxico—give freedom and commerce to those provinces and establish peace and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers on our interior—which will be the case so long as spain holds that large country on our borders jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition however on november  he learned from a military captain that burrs plans apparently included seizure of new orleans then part of the louisiana territory of the united states and incorporating it along with lands won from the spanish into a new empire he was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of brigadier general james wilkinson whom he deeply disliked in the plan jackson acted cautiously at first but wrote letters to numerous officials including president thomas jefferson vaguely warning them about the scheme in december jefferson a political opponent of burr issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the west and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia burr was soon captured and the men were sent home jackson traveled to richmond virginia to testify on burrs behalf the defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand fearing his remarks were too provocative burr was acquitted of treason despite jeffersons efforts to have him convicted jackson endorsed james monroe for president in  against james madison who was part of the jeffersonian wing of the democraticrepublican party military career war of  creek campaign and treaty main article creek war portrait by ralph e w earl c  leading up to  the united states found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict formal hostilities with spain or france never materialized but tensions with britain increased on account of a number of causes mainly these were britains persistent impressment of us sailors and interference with maritime trade during the napoleonic warswhich were seen as an offense against american honor and as a refusal to recognize american independence the encouragement of indian raids against american settlements and the desire of many americans for more land particularly british canada and florida the latter still controlled by spain britains european ally on june   congress officially declared war on the united kingdom of great britain and ireland beginning the war of  jackson responded enthusiastically sending a letter to washington offering  volunteers however the men were not called up for many months biographer robert v remini claims that jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the madison administration for his support for burr and monroe meanwhile the united states military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield on january   jackson led an army of  volunteers to new orleans to defend the region against british and native american attacks he was to serve under general wilkinson who commanded federal forces in new orleans however lacking adequate provisions wilkinson ordered jackson to halt in natchez now part of the mississippi territory and await further orders jackson reluctantly obeyed the newly appointed secretary of war john armstrong jr sent a letter to jackson dated february  ordering him dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to wilkinson in reply to armstrong on march  jackson defended the character and readiness of his men and promised to turn over his supplies however he also promised to instead of dismissing the troops in natchez march them back to nashville the march was filled with agony many of the men had fallen ill according to remini jackson ordered his officers to turn over their horses to the sick and he surrendered his own three horses for the duty trudging along his men day after day never showing weariness or fatigue he cheered the men with a word a gesture a sign of pride in them he paid for provisions for the men out of his own

garnered a welcoming response even outside of tennessee as many americans appreciated jacksons attacks on banks the panic of  had devastated the fortunes of many and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular with his growing political viability jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates along with crawford secretary of state adams speaker of the house henry clay and secretary of war john c calhoun during the era of good feelings the federalist party had faded away and all five presidential contenders were members of the democraticrepublican party jacksons campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions on the major issues of the day most prominently the tariff jackson expressed centrist beliefs and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions in  jackson allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of tennessees us senate seats and the legislature narrowly elected him his return after  years  months  days out of office marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history democraticrepublican presidential

who attended backed treasury secretary william h crawford for president and albert gallatin for vice president a pennsylvania convention nominated jackson for president a month later stating that the irregular caucus ignored the voice of the people and was a vain hope that the american people might be thus deceived into a belief that he crawford was the regular democratic candidate gallatin

regional base as adams dominated new england clay took three western states and crawford won virginia and georgia jackson won a plurality of the popular vote taking  percent although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency he won  electoral votes more than any other candidates but still short of  which he needed for a true majority with no candidate having won a majority of the electoral the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral votewinners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election as crawford and adams lacked jacksons national appeal and crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency however clay saw jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership he threw his support behind adams who shared clays support for federallyfunded internal improvements such as roads and canals with clays backing adams won the contingent election on the

van buren who had been a prominent supporter of crawford in the  election emerged as one of the strongest opponents of adamss policies and he settled on jackson as his preferred candidate in the  election van buren was joined by vice president calhoun who also opposed much of adamss agenda van buren and other jackson allies established numerous projackson newspapers and clubs around the country while jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his hermitage plantation in the election jackson won a commanding  percent of the popular vote and  percent of the electoral vote the election marked the definitive end of the oneparty era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and adamss followers became known as the national republicans the campaign was very much a personal one as was the custom at the time neither candidate personally campaigned but their political followers organized many campaign events both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press jackson was strongly attacked as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills were published to attack jackson one revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at new orleans another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of american indians killed in battle while still another labeled his mother a common prostitute and stated that jacksons father was a mulatto man rachel jackson was also a frequent target of attacks and was widely accused of bigamy the accusation was technically true it was based on the legal status of rachels marriage and divorce from her former husband many years prior  to  jacksons campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as minister to russia adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for the czar they also stated that adams had a billiard table in the white house and that he had charged the government for it rachel had been under extreme stress during the election and she never did well when jackson was away at war or work

president andrew jackson new york ritchie  co  jacksons name has been associated with jacksonian democracy or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties the age of jackson shaped the national agenda and american politics jacksons philosophy as president was similar to that of thomas jefferson advocating republican values held by the revolutionary war generationjackson took a moral tone with the belief that agrarian sympathies and a limited view of states rights and the federal government would produce less corruption he feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican values when south carolina opposed the tariff law he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession jackson believed that the presidents authority was derived from the people when selecting his cabinet instead of choosing party favorites jackson selected plain businessmen whom he intended to control jackson chose martin van buren of new york as secretary of state john eaton of tennessee as secretary of war samuel d ingham of pennsylvania as secretary of treasury john branch of north carolina as secretary of navy john m berrien of georgia as attorney general and william t barry of kentucky as postmaster general jacksons first choice of cabinet proved

promised to pursue reform by removing power from unfaithful or incompetent hands at the conclusion of the ceremony jackson invited the public to the white house where his supporters held a raucous party thousands of spectators overwhelmed the white house staff and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings jacksons populism earned him the nickname king mob petticoat affair main article petticoat affair jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair washington gossip circulated among jacksons cabinet members and their wives including vice president john c calhouns wife floride calhoun concerning secretary of war john h eaton and his wife peggy eaton salacious rumors held that peggy as a barmaid in her fathers tavern had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute controversy also ensued because peggy had married soon after her previous husbands death and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members led by mrs calhoun refused to socialize with the eatons allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but jackson refused to believe the rumors telling his cabinet that she is as chaste as a virgin jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers who in essence questioned and dishonored jackson himself by daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife these memories increased his dedication to defending peggy eaton meanwhile the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all american women was at stake they believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage a woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable historian daniel walker howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the womans rights movement secretary of state

indian removal act and subsequent treaties resulted in the forced removal of several indian tribes from their traditional territories including the trail of tears since jackson was a military commander he had played a prominent role in indian relations throughout his eight years in office jackson made about  treaties with native american tribes both in the south and the northwest jacksons presidency marked a new era in indiananglo american relations initiating a policy of indian removal jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various indian tribes though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates the southern tribes included the choctaw creek chickasaw seminole and the cherokee the northwest tribes include the chippewa ottawa and the potawatomi relations between indians and americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to civilize the indians but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention there had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue and out of this policy to relocate certain indian populations jackson never known for timidity became an advocate for this relocation policy in what is considered by some historians to be the most controversial aspect of his presidency jackson painted by earl  in his december   first annual message to congress jackson advocated land west of the mississippi river be set aside for indian tribes on may   congress passed the indian removal act which jackson signed into law two days later the act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west outside of existing state borders the act specifically pertained to the five civilized tribes in the south the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law jackson eaton and general coffee negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move jackson put eaton and coffee in charge of negotiating with the choctaw lacking jacksons skills at negotiation they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission the tactics worked and the chiefs agreed to move the removal of the choctaw took place in the winter of  and  and was wrought with misery and suffering the seminole despite the signing of the treaty of paynes landing in  refused to move in december  this dispute began the second seminole war the war lasted over six years finally ending in  members of the creek nation had signed the treaty of cusseta in  agreeing to move their tribe however the creeks later resisted leading to a second creek war the state of georgia became involved in a contentious dispute with the cherokee culminating in the  supreme court decision in worcester v georgia in that decision us supreme court chief justice john marshall writing for the court ruled that georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople jackson is frequently attributed the following response john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it the quote apparently indicating jacksons dismissive view of the courts was attributed to jackson by horace greeley who cited as his source representative george n briggs remini argues that jackson did not say it because while it certainly sounds like jacksonthere was nothing for him to enforce this is because a writ of habeas corpus had never been issued for the missionaries also the court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision as had become standard a group of cherokees led by john ridge negotiated the treaty of new echota ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the cherokee and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate another faction led by john ross unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal the treaty was enforced by jacksons successor president martin van buren who sent  troops to carry out the relocation policy due to the infighting between political factions many cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began subsequently as many as  cherokees died on the trail of tears in  more than  american indians were relocated to the west during jacksons administration though a few cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high smoky mountains the black hawk war took place during jacksons presidency in  after a group of indians crossed into us territory jacksons initiatives to deal with the conflicts between indians and american settlers has been a source of controversy starting around  jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left such as howard zinn often on this issue zinn called him the most aggressive enemy of the indians in early american history and exterminator of indians in  francis paul prucha argued that jacksons removal of the five civilized tribes from the very hostile white environment in the old south to oklahoma probably saved their very existence similarly remini argues that if not for jacksons policies the southern tribes would have been totally wiped out just like other tribesnamely the yamasee mahican and narragansettwhich did not move reforms rotation of offices and spoils system further information spoils system filejackson andrewpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of jackson as president in an effort to purge the government of corruption jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive cabinet offices and departments he believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies he asked congress to reform embezzlement laws reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties and laws to improve government accounting jacksons postmaster barry resigned after a congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances jackson replaced barry with treasury auditor and prominent kitchen cabinet member amos kendall who went on to implement much needed reforms in the postal service jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the electoral college by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to congress as president in his third annual message to congress he expressed the view i have heretofore recommended amendments of the federal constitution giving the election of president and vicepresident to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these changes in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press them upon the consideration of a new congress jacksons time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents the service pension act of  for instance provided pensions to veterans even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need while an act of july  enabled widows of revolutionary war soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husbands pensions in  jackson established the tenhour day in national shipyards jackson enforced the tenure of office act signed earlier by president monroe in  that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing fathertoson succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was a leading principle in the republican creed jackson noted in a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy the number of federal office holders removed by jackson were exaggerated by his opponents jackson only rotated about  of federal office holders during his first term some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes jackson however did use his image and presidential power to award loyal democrats by granting them federal office appointments jacksons approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership jackson stated if he lost his leg fighting for his country that is  enough for me jacksons theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the spoils system the political realities of washington however ultimately forced jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations historians believe jacksons presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of washington such as the new york customs house the postal service the departments of navy and war and the bureau of indian affairs whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades proved to be difficult other aspects of the spoils system including the buying of offices forced political party campaign participation and collection of assessments did not take place until after jacksons presidency nullification crisis main article nullification crisis in  congress had approved the tariff of abominations which set the tariff at an historically high rate southern planters who sold their cotton on the world market strongly opposed this tariff which they saw as favoring northern interests the issue nonetheless came to a head during jacksons presidency resulting in the nullification crisis in which south carolina threatened disunion the south carolina exposition and protest of  secretly written by calhoun asserted that their state had the right to nullify—declare void—the tariff legislation of  although jackson sympathized with the south in the tariff debate he also vigorously supported a strong union with effective powers for the central government jackson attempted to face down calhoun over the issue which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men one incident was at the april   jefferson day dinner involving afterdinner toasts robert hayne began by toasting to the union of the states and the sovereignty of the states jackson then rose and in a booming voice added our federal union it must be preserved – a clear challenge to calhoun calhoun clarified his position by responding the union next to our liberty the most dear in may  jackson discovered that calhoun had asked president monroe to censure thengeneral jackson for his invasion of spanish florida in  while calhoun was serving as secretary of war calhouns and jacksons relationship deteriorated further by february  the break between calhoun and jackson was final responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud calhoun had published letters between him and jackson detailing the conflict in the united states telegraph jackson and calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until jackson stopped it in july the telegraph edited by duff green had previously supported jackson after it took the side of calhoun jackson needed a new organ for the administration he enlisted the help of longtime supporter francis preston blair who in november  established a newspaper known as the washington globe which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the democratic party on july   jackson signed into law the tariff of  it was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates but the nullifiers in south carolina remained unsatisfied on november  the south carolina legislature officially nullified both the tariff of  and the tariff of  in response jackson sent us navy warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession on december   with less than two months remaining in his term calhoun resigned as vice president to become a us senator for south carolina in december  jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers stating that he considered the power to annul a law of the united states assumed by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had fought jackson also denied the right of secession the constitution  forms a government not a league  to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union is to say that the united states is not a nation jackson asked congress to pass a force bill explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff but its passage was delayed until protectionists led by clay agreed to a reduced compromise tariff the force bill and compromise tariff passed on march   and jackson signed both the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but in a final show of defiance nullified the force bill on may   jackson wrote the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question foreign affairs jacksons minister to france william c rives successfully negotiated a reparations treaty with france in  addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his first annual address to congress jackson declared it to be his settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong when jackson took office in  spoliation claims or compensation demands for the capture of american ships and sailors dating from the napoleonic era caused strained relations between the us and french governments the french navy had captured and sent american ships to spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules according to secretary of state martin van buren relations between the us and france were hopeless jacksons minister to france william c rives however through diplomacy was able to convince the french government to sign a reparations treaty on july   that would award the us ₣   in damages the french government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties the french king louis philippe i and his ministers blamed the french chamber of deputies by  the nonpayment of reparations by the french government drew jacksons ire and he became impatient in his december  state of the union address jackson sternly reprimanded the french government for nonpayment stating the federal government was wholly disappointed by the french and demanded congress authorize trade reprisals against france feeling insulted by jacksons words the french people demanded an apology in his december  state of the union address jackson refused to apologize stating he had a good opinion of the french people and his intentions were peaceful jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the french government was purposely stalling payment the french government accepted jacksons statements as sincere and in february  american reparations were paid in addition to france the jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with denmark portugal and spain jacksons state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with russia spain turkey great britain and siam under the treaty of great britain american trade was reopened in the west indies the trade agreement with siam was americas first treaty between the united states and an asiatic country as a result american exports increased  while imports increased  jacksons attempt to purchase texas from mexico for  failed the chargé daffaires in mexico colonel anthony butler suggested that the us take texas over militarily but jackson refused butler was later replaced toward the end of jacksons presidency in  the texas revolution began when proslavery american settlers in texas fought the mexican government for texan independence by may  they had routed the mexican military establishing an independent republic of texas the new texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from president jackson and annexation into the united states however jackson was hesitant recognizing texas unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from mexico and not wanting to make texas an antislavery issue during the  election the strategy worked the democratic party and national loyalties were held intact and van buren was elected president jackson formally recognized the republic of texas nominating a chargé daffaires on the last full day of his presidency march   jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade

original year charter was to end biddles recharter bill passed the senate on june  and the house on july   jackson believing that bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly whose stock was mostly held by foreigners vetoed the bill on july  jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values believing the bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy jackson stated the bank made the rich richer and the potent more powerful the national republican party immediately made jacksons veto of the bank a political issue jacksons political opponents castigated the veto as the very slang of the leveller and demagogue claiming jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man jackson however managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny clay proved to be no match to jacksons ability to resonate with the people and the democratic partys strong political networks democratic newspapers parades barbecues and rallies increased jacksons popularity jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from tennessee to washington dc jackson won the election decisively by a landslide receiving  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes clay received  percent of the popular vote and  electoral votes wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the antimasonic party folded jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the banks recharter and his continued warfare on the banks control over the national economy removal of deposits and censure in  jackson attempted to began removing federal deposits from the bank whose moneylending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across america thus drastically increasing credit and speculation jacksons moves were greatly controversial he removed his moderately probank treasury secretary louis mclane having him serve instead as secretary of state replacing edward livingston he replaced mclane with william j duane however in september he fired duane for refusing to remove the deposits he replaced him with attorney general roger b taney a strong opponent of the bank under taney the deposits began to be removed biddle responded by stockpiling the banks reserves and contracting credit thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic intended to force jackson into a compromise the move backfired increasing antibank sentiment in  those who opposed jacksons expansion of executive power united and formed the whig party calling jackson king andrew i and named their party after the english whigs who opposed eighteenth century british monarchy a movement emerged amongst whigs in the senate to censure jackson the censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by jacksonrival senator henry clay which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and jackson jackson called clay reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel on march  the senate voted to censure jackson – it also rejected taney as treasury secretary finally on january   when the jacksonians had a majority in the senate the censure was expunged after years of effort by jackson supporters the expunction movement was led by thomas hart benton who despite the brawl years earlier had become an ardent supporter of the president in  in response to increased land speculation jackson issued the specie circular an executive order that required buyers of government lands to pay in specie gold or silver coins the result was high demand for specie which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes causing the panic of  the white house van buren biography notes basically the trouble was the thcentury cyclical economy of boom and bust which was following its regular pattern but jacksons financial measures contributed to the crash his destruction of the second bank of the united states had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks wild speculation in lands based on easy bank credit had swept the west to end this speculation jackson in  had issued a specie circular attack and assassination attempt richard lawrences attempt on jacksons life as depicted in an  etching the first recorded physical attack on a us president was directed at jackson he had ordered the dismissal of robert b randolph from the navy for embezzlement on may   jackson sailed on uss cygnet to fredericksburg virginia where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of mary ball washington george washingtons mother during a stopover near alexandria randolph appeared and struck the president he fled the scene chased by several members of jacksons party including the writer washington irving jackson declined to press charges on january   what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting president of the united states occurred just outside the united states capitol when jackson was leaving through the east portico after the funeral of south carolina representative warren r davis richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at jackson which misfired lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring jackson infuriated attacked lawrence with his cane others present including davy crockett restrained and disarmed lawrence lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting he blamed jackson for the loss of his job he claimed that with the president dead money would be more plenty a reference to jacksons struggle with the bank of the united states and that he could not rise until the president fell finally he told his interrogators that he was a deposed english king—specifically richard iii dead since —and that jackson was his clerk he was deemed insane and was institutionalized afterwards the pistols were tested and retested each time they performed perfectly many believed that jackson had been protected by the same providence that they believed also protected their young nation the incident became a part of the jacksonian mythos jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life however his suspicions were never proven antislavery tracts during the summer of  northern abolitionists began sending antislavery tracts through the us postal system into the south proslavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials which were deemed incendiary some rioting also broke out jackson wanted sectional peace and desired to placate southerners ahead of the  election jackson also fiercely disliked the abolitionists whom he believed were by instituting sectional jealousies attempting to destroy the union however jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection he supported the solution of postmaster general amos kendall which gave southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the antislavery tracts he subsequently called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection us exploring expedition uss porpoise a brig ship laid down in  and launched in may  by secretary of navy dickerson used in the us exploring expedition jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office the last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from  to  led by stephen h harriman on the red river of the north jacksons predecessor president adams attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in  but congress was unwilling to fund the effort when jackson assumed office in  he pocketed adams expedition plans however wanting to establish his presidential legacy similar to thomas jefferson and the lewis and clark expedition jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term on may   jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic united states exploring expedition jackson put secretary of navy mahlon dickerson in charge to assemble suitable ships officers and scientific staff for the expedition with a planned launch before jacksons term of office expired dickerson however proved unfit for the task preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until  during the presidency of van buren one brig ship uss porpoise later used in the expedition having been laid down built and commissioned by secretary dickerson in may  circumnavigated the world explored and mapped the southern ocean confirming the existence of the antarctica continent panic of  main article panic of  a new york newspaper blamed the panic of  on andrew jackson depicted in spectacles and top hat the national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills in january  jackson paid off the entire national debt the only time in us history that has been accomplished however reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the panic of  contributing factors included jacksons veto of the second national bank renewal charter in  and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in  that caused western banks to relax their lending standards two other jacksonian acts in  contributed to the panic of  the specie circular that mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver and the deposit and distribution act that transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks jacksons specie circular albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver the same year there was a downturn in great britains economy that stopped investment in the united states as a result the us economy went into a depression banks became insolvent the national debt previously paid off increased business failures rose cotton prices dropped and unemployment dramatically increased the depression that followed lasted for four years until  when the economy began to

judicial appointments main article list of federal judges appointed by andrew jackson jackson appointed six justices to the supreme court of the united states states admitted to the union two new states were admitted into the union during jacksons presidency arkansas june   and michigan january   later life and death photographic copy of an  daguerreotype after serving two terms as president jackson retired to his hermitage plantation in  and immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son andrew jr although he suffered ill health jackson remained influential in both national and state politics he was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession insisting i will die with the union blamed for causing the panic of  he was unpopular in his early retirement jackson continued to denounce the perfidy and treachery of banks and urged his successor van buren to repudiate the specie circular as president as a solution to the panic he supported an independent treasury system which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation however a coalition of conservative democrats and whigs opposed the bill and it was not passed until  during the delay no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression van buren grew deeply unpopular a unified whig party nominated popular war hero william henry harrison and former jacksonian john tyler in the  presidential election the whigs campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the democrats during jacksons campaigns they depicted van buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary americans while glorifying harrisons military record and portraying him as a man of the people jackson campaigned heavily for van buren in tennessee he favored the nomination of james k polk of tennessee for vice president at the  democratic national convention over unpopular incumbent richard mentor johnson however no nominee was chosen and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress the democracy of the united states has been shamefully beaten jackson wrote to van buren but i trust not conquered however harrison died only a month into his term and was replaced by tyler jackson was encouraged because tyler was known to act as an independent and not be bound by party lines sure enough tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the whig party in  when he vetoed two whigsponsored bills to establish a new national bank bringing great satisfaction to jackson and other democrats after the second veto tylers entire cabinet with the exception of daniel webster resigned jackson strongly favored the annexation of texas a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency while jackson still feared that annexation would stir up antislavery sentiment his belief that the british would use texas as a base to reconquer the united states overrode his other concerns he also insisted that texas was part of the louisiana purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the united states at the request of senator robert j walker of mississippi acting on behalf of the tyler administration which also supported annexation jackson wrote several letters to texas president sam houston urging him to wait for the senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the united states would benefit texas initially jackson again supported van buren for president in  and polk for vice president when a letter from calhoun to british ambassador richard pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public van buren was moved into writing the hamlet letter opposing annexation this effectively extinguished any support that van buren might previously have enjoyed in the south jackson then threw his support behind polk for the nomination at the  democratic national convention polk emerged as the partys nominee after van buren failed to win the required twothirds majority of delegates george m dallas was selected for vice president jackson convinced tyler to drop his plans of running for reelection as an independent by promising as tyler requested to welcome the president and his allies back into the democratic party and by instructing blair to stop criticizing the president with jacksons support polk won the  presidential election narrowly defeating the whig nominee henry clay a bill of annexation was finally signed by tyler on march   jackson died at his plantation on june   at the age of  of chronic tuberculosis dropsy and heart failure according to a newspaper account from the boon lick times he fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed  but he subsequently revived  gen jackson died at the hermitage at  oclock pm on sunday the th instant  when the messenger finally came the old soldier patriot and christian was looking out for his approach he is gone but his memory lives and will continue to live in his will jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son andrew jackson jr except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members personal life family jackson had three adopted sons theodore an indian about whom little is known andrew jackson jr the son of rachels brother severn donelson and lyncoya a creek indian orphan adopted by jackson after the battle of tallushatchee lyncoya died of tuberculosis on july   at the age of sixteen the jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children john samuel donelson daniel smith donelson and andrew jackson donelson were the sons of rachels brother samuel donelson who died in  andrew jackson hutchings was rachels orphaned grand nephew caroline butler eliza butler edward butler and anthony butler were the orphaned children of edward butler a family friend they came to live with the jacksons after the death of their father the widower jackson invited rachels niece emily donelson to serve as hostess at the white house emily was married to andrew jackson donelson who acted as jacksons private secretary and in  ran for vice president on the american party ticket the relationship between the president and emily became strained during the petticoat affair and the two became estranged for over a year they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became cohostess of the white house in  it was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial first lady sarah took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in  jackson used rip raps as a retreat temperament tennessee gentleman portrait of jackson c  from the collection of the hermitage jacksons quick temper was notorious biographer h w brands notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper observers likened him to a volcano and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt his close associates all had stories of his bloodcurdling oaths his summoning of the almighty to loose his wrath upon some miscreant typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition given his record—in duels brawls mutiny trials and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously on the last day of the presidency jackson admitted that he had but two regrets that he had been unable to shoot henry clay or to hang john c calhoun reminiwho is of the opinion that jackson was often in control of his rage and that he used it along with his fearsome reputation as a tool to get what he wanted physical appearance jackson was a lean figure standing at  feet  inch  m tall and weighing between  and  pounds  kg on average jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age  he had penetrating deep blue eyes jackson was one of the more sickly presidents suffering from chronic headaches abdominal pains and a hacking cough much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake religious faith in  jackson became a member of the first presbyterian church in nashville jackson was a freemason initiated at harmony lodge no  in tennessee he also participated in chartering several other lodges in tennessee he was the only us president to have served as grand master of a states grand lodge until harry s truman in  his masonic apron is on display in the tennessee state museum an obelisk and bronze masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the hermitage legacy and memory historical reputation equestrian statue of gen jackson jackson county courthouse kansas city missouri commissioned by judge harry s truman jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in american history historian charles grier sellers says andrew jacksons masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the american stage his most controversial presidential actions included removal of the indians from the southeast the dismantling of the bank of the united states and his threat to use military force against the state of south carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the british at new orleans in the last battle of the war of  he was the main founder of the modern democratic party and became its iconic hero he was always a fierce partisan with many friends and many enemies jackson was criticised by his contemporary alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america for flattering the dominant ideas of his time including the mistrust over the federal power for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law “ far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government it is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his popularity general jackson is the slave of the majority he yields to its wishes its propensities and its demands—say rather anticipates and forestalls them  general jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority but when he feels that his popularity is secure he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of those which it does not regard with jealousy supported by a power that his predecessors never had he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility without example he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would have ventured to attempt he even treats the national representatives with a disdain approaching to insult he puts his veto on the laws of congress and frequently neglects even to reply to that powerful body he is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly ” — alexis de tocqueville democracy in america  volume i chapter xviii brands observes that jacksons reputation declined after the midth century as his actions towards indians and african americans received new attention after the civil rights movement brand writes his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised further by the turn of the present st century it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing american schoolchildren learned about jackson was that he was the author of the trail of tears on a more favorable note remini argues that jacksonian democracystretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workableas such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in american history—populism progressivism the new and fair deals and the programs of the new frontier and great society jackson has long been honored along with thomas jefferson in the jefferson–jackson day fundraising dinners each year the dinner has been held by state democratic party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders however due to the fact that both jefferson and jackson were slave owners as well as jacksons indian removal policies many state party organizations have renamed the dinners portrayal on banknotes and stamps jackson portrait on obverse  bill jackson has appeared on us banknotes as far back as  and extending into the st century his image has appeared on the    and  note most recently his image appears on the us  federal reserve note series  with a redesigned larger portrait in  treasury secretary jack lew announced his goal that by  an image of harriet tubman would replace jacksons depiction on the front side of the  banknote and that an image of jackson would be placed on the reverse side though the final decision will be made by his successors jackson has appeared on  different us postage stamps only george washington abraham lincoln and benjamin franklin have appeared more often he first appeared on an  cent stamp which is commonly referred to by collectors as the black jack due to the large portraiture of jackson on its face printed in pitch black during the american civil war the confederate government also issued two confederate postage stamps bearing jacksons portrait one a cent red stamp and the other a cent green stamp both issued in  memorials main article list of memorials to andrew jackson the tomb of andrew and rachel jackson located at the hermitage numerous counties and

washington dc in jackson square new orleans in nashville on the grounds of the tennessee state capitol and in jacksonville florida other equestrian statues of jackson have been erected elsewhere as in

andrew johnson both us presidents born in north carolina there is a bust of andrew jackson in plaza ferdinand vii in pensacola florida where he became the first governor of the florida territory in  popular culture depictions jackson and his wife rachel were the main subjects of a  historical novel by irving stone the presidents lady which told the story of their lives up until rachels death the

history member pricepublisher pricequantity member creditor add to boxavengerinchief despite his populist reverence for the “sovereign people” andrew jackson spent his career severely limiting that sovereignty—often in the name of inflicting his brand of justice on nonamericans he made his name as a lawyer maintaining federal authority by ejecting white squatters from native lands yet he also waged total war against the cherokees and creeks and during the long war in the south and west from  to  brushed aside restraints on holy genocide—all in the name of “avenging the blood” of innocent white colonists avenging the people reveals how jackson became a hero to those who saw the united states as uniquely lawful and victimized—and used that legend to beat back some of our best hopes for the republican future review quotes “many americans long for a strong man to lead the nation and avenge their grievances in this eloquent book jason opal astutely and vividly recovers the backstory to that longing in the personal charisma frontier violence legal reasoning and assertive selfrighteousness of andrew jackson and his america”—alan taylor author of american revolutions a continental history  “if you think there can’t be much more to say about andrew jackson you will share my excitement at how much jason opal has discovered in his subject’s diverse hatreds against whigs and indians britons and bankers opal has found a unifying thread—jackson’s obsession with revenge—that helps to explain them all”—woody holton author of unruly americans and the origins of the constitution “jason opal shows how a violent frontier ruled by vengeance shaped the characters of andrew jackson and so many of his countrymen this vivid wideranging meticulously documented narrative will fascinate history buffs and scholars alike”—daniel walker howe author of what hath god wrought the transformation of america  “what a riveting book this is how is it that americans a professedly civilized and peaceloving people have at times behaved so savagely and even gloried in their savagery j m opal’s provocative take on jacksonian character rewrites andrew jackson not as commonman champion but as avengerinchief the avatar of a nation whose defining trait was not equality or democracy but an unslakable craving for vengeance”—daniel feller university of tennessee about the author jm opal is associate professor of history at mcgill university specializing in colonial revolutionary and th century american history he is the author of beyond the farm national ambitions in rural
