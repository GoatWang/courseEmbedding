solid espp k vision is amazing dental health etc and the company does take care of its employees in that respect you can expect typical startup checklist items like catered lunch twice a week stocked fridges for snacks standing desks etc in most officescons there have been some pretty severe commission issues and they do claw back commissions when receivables are unpaid by agencies before this several people were not getting paid for months at a time for a company that touts transparency there is frankly zero transparency into how people get what commission am teams get paid based off of some mysterious meritbased commission structure theres also an intensely koolaid culture in some respects i almost feel like im committing sacrilege by giving ttd less than  stars and putting my job security at risk there are many situations where youll be heavily vilified by other team members for leaving before  oclock this is not a wfh friendly company in almost all situations with a few

culture market position strategy and successthe people here really like each other and enjoy the time that they spend together the company understands how important culture is to their overall success and shows time and again that the culture cannot be risked in the pursuit of other goals there is no lipservice to this herethe engineering team has scaled very nicely using methodologies that many other companies wouldnt dare attempt distribution of development around the world and shared ownership of all key components there also is absolutely no benefit to being in the home office this is a tremendous benefit to the people that do not want to live in the expensive areas where tech and the advertising world tend to congregate people can work on any project from any location around the world thats very rare in the world of software developmentwe celebrate company successes more than individual successes though we recognize and celebrate those as well and there is a constant focus on doing things that make the company and our customers successfulthere is a good mix of shortterm and longterm focus in development it is so easy in a world of limited resources and unlimited things to build to focus only on what can make us the most money tomorrow while not planning for whats needed in  months or a year that always leads to tons of pain down the roadsomehow even with all of that worklife balance is as good as it gets people work hard and then go home our office lights up around am every day and nobody is ever there past p most people in the office work a solid  hour day and

difficult to come up with something that i feel is much more difficult at the trade desk than other places that ive worked the biggest difficulty in our office is that we cant find enough engineers
