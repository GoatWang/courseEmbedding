john f kennedy on november   at dallas texas statement of special agent paul e landis jr united states secret service concerning his activities and official duties on november   on november   i arrived at love field airport dallas texas at  am having traveled from ft worth texas to dallas texas on board us air force flight  upon my arrival i disembarked from the aircraft and immediately walked to where the motorcade vehicles were parked special agent sam kinney was the first person that i recognized and i remember speaking to him and standing by the followup car and jokingly asking him if he could tell me where the followup car was after speaking to sam i walked over to special agent win lawson just to double check to see if i was still assigned to working the followup car as had previously been arranged he was standing by the front right fender of the car in which the president would be riding and he told me that  was still to ride in the followup car only a very few moments later the presidents aircraft was pulling up to its mooring spot and i moved up to where i would be near the president and first lady when they disembarked from the aircraft there appeared to be a very large crowd at the airport and most of the people were restrained behind a chainlink fence which was about four or five feet high on the opposite side of the fence from the crowd there was a very narrow sidewalk and curbing which ran along the fenceline there were several people on the same side of the fence as the president but most of them were photographers as soon as the president and first lady disembarked from the aircraft mrs kennedy was presented a bouquet of roses the president was also presented what appeared to be two handdrawn charcoal portraits of himself and mrs kennedy in a black leather and glass folding frame i believe that this was given to him by a lady wearing a red coat just after the president received the black leather frame i held out my hand and he handed it to me i had been standing just off to mrs kennedys left slightly in front of her she was on the left side of the president at this time the president and first lady started walking towards the crowd which was restrained behind the fence on the way they did stop for a few seconds to talk to an elderly lady in a wheel chair who was on the field area about thirty feet from where the above presentations were made they then walked over to the crowd and walked along the fence from their right to their left at first i was in front of the president clearing a pathway through the photographers and observing the crowd reaching over the fence but i noticed that mrs kennedy was moving along slower and becoming separated from the president so i asked another agent i dont recall who to move up where i was and i dropped back to assist special agent clinton hill who was next to mrs kennedy i continued to keep a pathway clear for mrs kennedy removing small hand signs that had been dropped in her pathway on the sidewalk and occasionally cautioning to watch out for the curbing at one point where the direction of the fence made a right angle turn to the left of the way we were moving i do remember reaching up and holding a fairly large flag away that someone was waving over the fence only a few feet further and the fence and sidewalk made another  degree turn in the direction in which we were originally moving at this point we stopped momentarily and started in the direction of the cars which were slightly behind us and had been moving along towards us mrs kennedy asked where the president was and sa hill noticed him continuing along the fence shaking hands with the crowd so mrs kennedy returned to the fence and did the same only a short distance later the president and first lady stopped shaking hands and entered their automobile i stood by the right rear side until the car started moving and then hopped on the right rear portion of the right running board of the followup car i was standing with my right leg on the running board and my left leg up over and inside the followup car i stayed in this position until we were leaving the airport area and remarked that i might as well get all the way in and i did so i glanced at my watch but i dont recall the time special agents glen bennett and george hickey were seated to my left respectively in the rear of the followup car mr david powers was seated directly in front of me in the center portion of the followup car and mr kenneth odonnell was seated on mr powers left special agent sam kinney was driving and atsaic roberts was seated in the right front seat special agents john ready clinton hill and tim mcintyre were standing on the right front left front and left rear portions of the running board respectively the motorcade had not proceeded far when atsaic roberts asked me to get back on the outside running board just in case which i immediately did the crowd was about two deep along each side of the road and i would guess that we were traveling about twenty miles per hour as the motorcade proceeded towards the main business section of downtown dallas i watched the crowd for anyone trying to run towards the presidents car or any person who might be holding anything harmful in his hands i observed the rooftops and windows of the buildings along the route on the outskirts of town most of the buildings were of a one or two story type structure and very few people were on the rooftops the crowd was three or more deep along the street as we proceeded towards downtown dallas with most intersections more heavily crowded the outskirts seemed to consist mostly of used car lots junk dealers auto parts stores and this typical type of neighborhood at one intersection there were some cuban pickets but i dont recall exactly what their signs said except that they did have cuba on them a little further towards town some people had a sign asking the president to please stop and shake hands which he saw as he passed and stopped i immediately ran up to his car as it stopped and assumed a position next to him and observed the crowd as it merged on the car especially watching the hands most of the people were children but i do remember one of the adult ladies who was holding the sign remarking it worked our sign worked at various places along the route i remember mr dave powers standing up and taking movies of the presidents car and the crowd the closer we came to downtown dallas the larger the crowds became at several places they were forcing their way into the street and there was just barely enough room for the cars to get through there were two motorcycle escorts on each side of the presidents and the followup car and in several instances the crowd was so close that the motorcycles could not get through and had to drop completely behind the followup car during these instances sa clint hill would run up and jump on the left rear bumper of the presidents car and he would ride there until the crowd was further back away from the presidents car just before we reached the heart of downtown dallas i remember noticing some new looking very high multistoried skyscrapers and i remarked to jack ready that there were even people way up on the roof of one i think the motorcade made a right turn onto main street as that is the only street sign i saw and remembered i remember thinking to myself that about every town i know of has a main street im not sure how far we traveled on main street but i do know that this is where the crowd seemed heaviest the buildings were tall on both sides of the street but i didnt notice many people in the windows i continued to scan the crowds on the street and the buildings along the route i glanced at the presidents car somewhere along main street and saw clint hill again standing on the left rear bumper behind mrs kennedy who was seated to the presidents left governor connally was seated in front of the president and mrs connally was in front of mrs kennedy the crowd lined both sides of the street and in several places was right out into the street leaving barely enough room to get through not long after we turned onto main street there was one boy who i would say was in his early teens who ran out from the crowd after the presidents and follow up cars had passed and tried to overtake the presidents car i saw him coming and tapped sa ready on the shoulder and pointed towards him he was carrying a camera sa ready jumped off the running board overtook the boy and pushed him back into the crowd when we reached the end of main street we turned right and approached a gradual left turn as we approached the intersection and while we were turning left the crowd seemed to thin and almost disappear around the turn i then made a quick surveillance of a building which was to be on the presidents right once the left turn was completed it appeared to be the last one in sight it was a modernistic type building approximately eight stories high and it had large glass windows i also seem to recollect orange paneling or siding none of the windows were open and i did not see anyone standing by them i surmised that the building was closed or that all its employees were out on the street corner as the presidents car continued around the corner i continued to survey the crowd along the right hand side of the road and noticed that it was fairly scattered with hardly enough people to form a single line i continued to look ahead to an overpass over the route we were traveling at approximately this point i would say the presidents car and the followup car had just completed their turns and both were straightening out at this moment i heard what sounded like the report of a highpowered rifle from behind me over my right shoulder when i heard the sound there was no question in my mind what it was my first glance was at the president as i was practically looking in his direction anyway i saw him moving in a manner which i thought was to look in the direction of the sound i did not realize that president kennedy had been shot at this point i immediately returned my gaze over my right shoulder toward the modernistic building i had observed before with a quick glance i saw nothing and immediately started scanning the crowd at the intersection from my right to my left i observed nothing unusual and began to think that the sound had been that of a fire cracker but i hadnt seen any smoke in fact i recall special agent jack ready saying what was it a fire cracker i remarked i dont know i dont see any smoke so far the lapsed period of time could not have been over two or three seconds all during this time i continued to scan the crowd returning my gaze towards the presidents car it must have been another second or two before the next shot was fired because as i recall having seen nothing out of the ordinary i then thought that maybe one of the cars in the motorcade had had a blowout that had echoed off the buildings i looked at the right front tire of the presidents car and saw it was all right i then glanced to see the right rear tire but could not because the followup car was too close i also thought of trying to run and jump on the presidents car but did not think i could make it because of the speed at which we were traveling i decided i had better stay where i was so that i would at least be near the first lady to whom i am assigned i think that it was at this point that i thought faster faster faster thinking that we could not get out of the area soon enough however i dont have any idea as to how fast we were then moving i had drawn my gun but i am not sure exactly when i did this i did leave my suit coat unbuttoned all during the motorcade movement thinking at the time that i could get to my gun faster this way if i had to i glanced towards the president and he still appeared to be fairly upright in his seat leaning slightly toward mrs kennedy with his head tilted slightly back i think mrs kennedy had her right arm around the presidents shoulders at this time i also remember special agent clinton hill attempting to climb onto the back of the presidents car it was at this moment that i heard a second report and it appeared that the presidents head split open with a muffled exploding sound i can best describe the sound as i heard it as the sound you would get by shooting a high powered bullet into a five gallon can of water or shooting into a melon i saw pieces of flesh and blood flying through the air and the president slumped out of sight towards mrs kennedy the time lapse between the first and second report must have been about four or five seconds my immediate thought was that the president could not possibly be alive after being hit like he was i still was not certain from which direction the second shot came but my reaction at this time was that the shot came from somewhere towards the front righthand side of the road i did not notice anyone on the overpass and i scanned the area to the right of and below the overpass where the terrain sloped towards the road on which we were traveling the only person i recall seeing clearly was a negro male in light green slacks and a beige colored shirt running from my left to right up the slope across a grassy section along a sidewalk towards some steps and what appeared to be a low stone wall he was bent over while running and i started to point towards him but i didnt notice anything in his hands and by this time we were going under the overpass at a very high rate of speed i was looking back and saw a motorcycle policeman stopping along the curb approximately adjacent to where i saw the negro running after we rode under the overpass i again looked at the presidents car and saw special agent clint hill lieing across the trunk he was looking back towards the followup car shaking his head back and forth and gave a thumbsdown sign with his hand atsaic roberts asked if anyone got the exact time of the shooting and someone said about  pm  then someone told me to get inside the car and pulled me by the arm my sun glasses fell off and special agent bennett handed them to me by now we were on an expressway and a few people were standing in spots along the way waving as we went by atsaic roberts was telling the other agents in the followup car to cover vice president johnson as soon as we stopped sometime around  pm we arrived at parkland memorial hospital i immediately ran to the left rear side of the presidents car reached over and tried to help mrs kennedy up by taking hold of her shoulders she did not want to let go of president kennedy whose head she held in her lap and she was bending over him she said something like no i want to stay with him agent hill had in the meantime opened the left rear door of the presidential convertible stepped inside and took mrs kennedy by the arm she released the president and someone said cover up his head agent hill took off his suit coat and covered up the presidents head i also remember mr powers leaning in the car and saying oh no mr president mr president by this time someone was lifting the presidents body out of the right side of the car agent hill helped mrs kennedy out of the car and i followed mrs kennedys purse and hat and a cigarette lighter were on the back seat i picked these three items up as i walked through the car and followed mrs kennedy into the hospital the presidents body was taken directly to an emergency room and i think i remember mrs kennedy following the people in but coming out almost immediately the door to the emergency room was closed and i stayed by mrs kennedys side someone in the meantime had brought a chair for mrs kennedy to sit in and she sat just outside of the emergency room there were several people milling around and with the help of a nurse we cleared all unauthorized personnel out of the immediate area someone came out of the room that the president was in and asked if anyone knew his blood type asaic kellerman and sa hill immediately reached for their wallets asaic kellerman gave the man the information first at one point someone else came out of the presidents room again and said he was still breathing mrs kennedy stood up and said do you mean he may live no one answered most of the time while in the hospital i stayed right next to mrs kennedy twice i believe she went into the room where the president was however i remained outside by the door a short time later i still remember several people standing around and i asked a doctor for help in clearing the area at approximately  pm the presidents body was wheeled from the hospital in a coffin into an ambulance special agent andrew berger drove the ambulance asaic kellerman and atsaic stout were in the front seat mrs kennedy admiral burkley and agent hill rode in the rear of the ambulance with the presidents body i rode in the followup car behind the ambulance which departed the hospital at  pm at  pm the presidents body arrived at love field airport and several secret service agents immediately carried it on board us air force no one via the rear door i followed on board behind mrs kennedy and then moved to the forward section of the plane i witnessed the swearing in of president johnson at  pm in the center compartment on board air force  and at  pm departed love field airport dallas texas via air force no one with mrs kennedy and the body of the late president kennedy upon our arrival at andrews air force base md at  pm i helped carry the late president kennedys coffin from air force  the body was placed in an ambulance which departed andrews air force base at approximately  pm driven by special agent william greer asaic kellerman admiral burkley and i rode in the front seat of the ambulance mrs kennedy and attorney general robert kennedy rode in the rear of the ambulance with president kennedys body the above party arrived at bethesda naval hospital bethesda md at approximately  pm special agent hill and i escorted mrs kennedy to the th floor where we immediately secured the area only hospital personnel assigned to the area kennedy family members and friends and authorized personnel were allowed in the area i only left the th floor twice while mrs kennedy was there once to find asaic kellerman in the hospital morgue and give him a telephone message from chief rowley the other time was to find a white house driver at  am on november   mrs kennedy and attorney general robert kennedy departed bethesda naval hospital via ambulance accompanying the late president john f kennedys body to the white house special agent william greer was driving and asaic kellerman accompanied special agent clinton hill rode in the first limousine behind the ambulance and i rode in the second limousine the above party arrived at the white house at  am s paul e landis jr special agent us secret service   treasury department united states secret service the assassination of president john f kennedy as it appeared to paul e landis jr special agent u s secret service i was assigned to work the followup car from love field airport dallas texas my position was on the right rear portion of the running board special agent john ready was on the running board ahead of me sas hill and mcintyre were on the lefthand running board sas bennett and hickey were in the rear seat mr kenneth odonnell and dave powers were in the middle seats and atsaic roberts was in the front seat and sam kinney was driving i remember the motorcade reaching the end of main street in downtown dallas texas turning right and approaching a gradual left turn as the presidents car approached the intersection to make the left turn the crowd appeared to thin down and almost end as we reached the intersection i made a quick surveillance of a building on the right side of the route which appeared to be the last one that the president would pass it was a modernistic building about eight stories high with large glass windows none of the windows were open
