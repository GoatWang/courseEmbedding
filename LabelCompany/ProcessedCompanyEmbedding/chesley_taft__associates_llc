helps us identify future prospective investments we use a variety of research sources and supplement that with our own investigations and analysis selling purchasing securities is only half of the process selling is critical we are careful not to overreact but we do monitor trading and valuation trends that may be precursors of negative news just as importantly we monitor the portfolio and sell holdings as needed to maintain portfolio diversification sell decisions are triggered by negative changes in fundamentals which reduces a company’s or issuer’s longterm earnings ability such as a deterioration in the issuer’s financial position extraordinary events such as a merger which we believe will negatively alter a company’s performance significant changes in the valuation of the asset

goals of our clients we are looking for investments not trades we select stocks with reasonable market valuations based on their anticipated earnings prospects and patterns of strong earnings and revenue growth we particularly focus on historical sales and earnings growth stability of earnings return on equity debt to total market capitalization in evaluating specific stocks we rely on our own analysis based on the collective experience and varying perspectives of our portfolio managers as well as third party research and research provided by major wall street firms we look at various technical and valuation measures one such measure is the peg ratio this measure compares the priceearnings ratio to the expected growth rate of the company if the peg ratio is too high a stock may be overvalued relative to its future growth we often supplement our individual stock holdings with exchange traded funds etfs or mutual funds to broaden exposure or more efficiently access certain investment themes our fixed income selection process criteria is established for each client based on the portfolio goals risk profile and tax bracket the structure of the portfolio is then adjusted based on our evaluation of current and expected interest rates taking into account economic conditions such as monetary policy fiscal policy economic strength and inflation depending on whether we are structuring a portfolio of taxable securities or municipal bonds we select securities that meet the quality and maturity criteria established for the individual client portfolio we also use exchangetraded funds or mutual funds to gain exposure to specific market segments when we deem it beneficial to the client just as with our equity portfolios the sell discipline is critical to longterm success we monitor the credit quality of our holdings if there is significant deterioration of the credit quality we will assess the longterm implications and respond accordingly we will also

to our business  first quarter reviewby william a goldstein april   during the first quarter of this year stocks continued their upward march to the surprise of many investors  the s  p  stock index was up  although performance across various sectors of the market was quite uneven  while the s  p technology index was up  and the health care index up  the sp energy index was down  perspectivesby joan m giardina february   never in the past forty years have i experienced a time when the political climate so dominated the investment discourse and my discussions with you my clients for those forty years one axiom has held true the economy matters not politics even politicians mostly know that this time feels different it isn’t  fourth quarter reviewby william a goldstein january   once again the equity markets surprised investors with the standard and poor’s  stock index rising  for the calendar year  all the more surprising since pundits were unanimous in the opinion that a trump election victory would result in a sharp market decline trump – where do we go from hereby brian zavalkoff november   it goes without saying that the results of last night’s election were surprising not only did it seem unlikely that donald trump would win the election the possibility that the republicans would end up controlling the presidency senate and the house was really not even on the radar  third quarter reviewby william a goldstein october   the third quarter of the year was a volatile one as the equity markets contemplated the impact of federal reserve action or inaction and election consequences  these important issues provided plenty of uncertainty to foster investor concern  however in spite of these issues the standard and poor’s  stock index was up  for the quarter and  for the year to date  this was indeed a strong performance considering the circumstances  second quarter reviewby william a goldstein july   in  while walking through a gallery in evanston i purchased a lithograph by salvador dali  the subject was a bull fight  the matador is depicted standing over the bull the bull is full of picks bleeding at the mouth on his front knees but not dead  the bull had not given up the fight  first quarter reviewby william a goldstein april   we ended the first quarter of  “back where we started” stocks were about unchanged with the s  p  stock index up  and short term interest rates little changed getting “back where we started” however was a roller coaster ride for stocks as the s  p  declined  and then recovered a brief market comment  china and the markets by brian zavalkoff january   a client asked me today if i was nervous about the markets i am not sure nervous would be the right word i am annoyed though and somewhat cautious that said my comments about the full year do still stand  year in review and  market outlook by brian zavalkoff january   if you paid absolutely no attention to us financial markets in  you might think that it was a rather uneventful year  year in review by william a goldstein january   it is amazing six years of rising stock prices and so little optimism  since the stock market low of march   for the dow jones industrial average stocks have been in a generally rising trend ending  at   third quarter reviewby william a goldstein october   concern about interest rates and their impact on earnings currencies and global economic growth dominated the headlines and contributed to stock and bond market volatility during the third quarter market updateby joan m giardina august   there is no question that the stock market is in the vernacular correcting  after hitting new highs in may the momentum has gone from relatively stable to outright drop  second quarter reviewby william a goldstein july   double double toil and trouble fire burn and caldron bubble a brief note on the markets  china greece and the us impactby brian zavalkoff july   over the last few weeks volatility has increased substantially in the global equity markets i thought i would send a brief note discussing the two major culprits greece and china as well as the ramifications for the us markets and economy  first quarter reviewby william a goldstein april   during the past quarter the s  p  stock index rose a modest  but marked the ninth consecutive quarterly increase  perhaps the lackluster market performance is a result of somewhat disappointing earnings by large global companies due to foreign exchange conversion   year in review by william a goldstein january   “bulls make money  bears make money  pigs get slaughtered”  this old wall street adage comes to mind as we end  with the standard  poor’s  stock index up  following a  increase in   year in review and  market outlook by brian zavalkoff january    turned out to be a very solid year for investors and the economy – if your sole focus was the united states the truth is that  was a year of great disparity the greater your focus on the united states the better that you performed comments regarding recent stock market volatilityby brian zavalkoff october   over the last three months stock market gyrations have picked up substantially culminating with this week producing the largest weekly market decline sp   since may of  i thought it might be timely to provide some perspective as to what has been driving the markets and what if anything should be done about it  third quarter reviewby william a goldstein october   stocks provided a modest return of  for the third quarter as measured by the sp index while the year to date return has been    second quarter reviewby william a goldstein july   what is the likelihood of a major stock market correction   this is an often asked but not unreasonable question  first quarter reviewby william a goldstein april   what are you worried about  that is the question we are asked most often  year end reviewby william a goldstein january    was a remarkable year for investors as u s stock market indices reached alltime highs  it does not seem that long since  when the cover of “business week” proclaimed the death of stocks and many said equities and the u s economy would not recover for decades  year in review and  market outlookby brian zavalkoff january    proved to be another very interesting year investors entered  concerned that rising tax rates and a potential government shutdown would put a halt to a still fledgling economic recovery  third quarter reviewby william a goldstein october   the third quarter of  was another good quarter for stocks  the standard  poor  stock index increased  during the quarter and  for the year through september th the taper that wasn’t  on to government shutdownby brian zavalkoff september   well yesterday was a little bit of a surprise after four months of prepping the markets for the beginning of tapering slowing down federal reserve purchase of government bonds the federal reserve elected to defer the tapering process for a little while why the stock market has done so well this year and a brief comment on the sequester by brian zavalkoff march   the stock markets have certainly started the year on a strong note with
