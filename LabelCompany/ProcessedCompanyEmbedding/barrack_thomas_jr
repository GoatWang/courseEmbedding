campaign plans to launch a new fundraising push later this month with a los angeles event hosted by thomas barrack the founder and executive chairman of colony capital which sold its stake in miramax in march the washington post reported that the event would be held on may  and would be followed by dozens of other fundraisers as trump shifts to a new campaign finance strategy that will draw on big dollar donors trump’s campaign has said that he will still spend his own money on the campaign but in an indication that trump also will tap a network of donors and bundlers his campaign last week named steven mnuchin chairman and ceo of dune capital management and a major cofinancier of warner bros movies as his national finance chairman related ‘the newsroom’s’ ‘will mcavoy’ donald trump is not the best case scenario for hillary clinton barrack’s colony capital is a global real estate firm that purchased miramax from disney in  but colony and another shareholder qatar investment authority sold their stakes to bein media group in march up to that point barrack had served as miramax’s chairman since  barrack endorsed trump in february calling him “the only candidate in america

entertainment companies and hardworking employees is a dynastic art form” barrack said at the time a challenge for trump’s fundraising will be in raising the hundreds of millions needed to wage a general election campaign in a relatively short period of time there is also the question of just how much of the showbiz community will support trump as hollywood’s fundraising traditionally leans heavily to the democrats the split so far this cycle is  to  according to the center for responsive politics on may  hillary clinton is scheduled to make her th visit to los angeles since announcing her candidacy with a fundraiser at the home of caa’s bryan lourd and restaurateur bruce bozzi cohosted by anna wintour even so past gop nominees mitt romney and john mccain have found enough support to make showbizfocused fundraisers worthwhile as they headed into the general election longtime gop donors like broadcasting mogul stanley hubbard have said that they would back trump but others who bundled in the past like former mgm chief harry sloan have been wary of trump’s candidacy mitt romney himself continued his criticism of trump on wednesday with a facebook post that questioned why trump was not releasing his tax returns a spokeswoman for barrack declined comment a trump campaign spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment it’s expected that the trump campaign will join with the republican national committee for a joint fundraising operation that will allow donors to contribute more than the  limit to the candidate clinton has already formed a joint fundraising committee with the democratic national committee called the hillary victory fund proceeds from a recent fundraiser at the home of george clooney went to that fund in which money is split

made his fortune in real estate has discovered a market in distressed celebrities with neverland ranch and miramax under his belt he’s now on a shopping spree�and bringing along his buddy rob lowe by benjamin wallace published nov   sharethis photo ramona rosales you’ll see why michael called this place neverland� says tom barrack the newest owner of michael jackson’s neverland valley ranch barrack is a yearold billionaire with a gleaming shaved head summerinsardinia tan personally trained muscles and sockless tasseled loafers he is sitting on the lawn beside the tudorstyle panicroomequipped main house near a gnarled oak tree with steps winding up to the perch where jackson wrote bad this the manicured park with the giant floral clock and movie theater featuring isolation boxes for immunocompromised children�default broll for all tv coverage of jackson�comprises just  acres it scarcely hints at the grandeur of the full property which is nearly ten times that size with  oaks and sycamores the odd rattlesnake and mountain lion and a former chumash indian worship site overlooking a savannahlike plain �you’ll feel something which i think was what drove him� barrack says of the chumash site �and i don’t mean that�i’m not coming from outer space�but you will actually feel it i promise� when barrack’s privateequity firm colony capital took over neverland in november  averting foreclosure even the groomed portion was going to seed jackson selfexiled after his childmolestation acquittal to places like bahrain and las vegas hadn’t been home since early  his  employees had dwindled to four the amusementpark rides and steam train�operable only by california’s single licensed steamtrain engineer�had been sold off to raise money the petting zoo’s animals had been removed by animalrescue groups the snakes from the reptile barn were um released into the wild since then barrack’s team has worked steadily to rehabilitate the estate refinishing the wood floors relandscaping acres of grass introducing more swans into the lakes and repositioning jackson’s statue of a longgunbrandishing pirate to scare off coyotes in the dance studio a solitary bulb lights a spot worn down by jackson’s spinning the elephant barn now houses a labyrinth of walls filled with effusive notes penned by visitors from around the world the only obvious reminders of jackson’s complicated legacy are the bronze statues of children at play that dot the estate see alsohow colony capital should spend its new  million entertainment fund barrack built his fortune making deals and in some ways neverland began as just another one�a contrarian bet on a troubled asset an operating business backed by real estate only in this case the operating business was a person colony would bail jackson out of his substantial debt in return the firm would assume ownership of neverland and jackson after a thirteenyear hiatus would go back to work to generate new revenue jackson’s death before he could carry out a planned comeback tour turned the transaction into more of a straightforward realestate play colony is fixing up neverland and plans to sell it at some point for a profit but after doing the jackson deal barrack and his team began to wonder whether they might have stumbled on a whole new class of investment the distressed celebrity earlier this year two financial firms cantor fitzgerald and media derivatives moved to create futures exchanges devoted to betting on film boxoffice receipts neither plan made it through congress which was heavily lobbied by hollywood studios but these wouldbe speculators weren’t alone in seeking a new way for wall street to enter the cultural marketplace earlier this fall caa sold a  percent stake of its agency to the privateequity firm tpg modeling the deal on ted forstmann’s purchase of img in  and while there have always been moneymen willing to buy a stake in the big studios along with a deep bench of bored tycoons eager to �executive produce� their way into hanging out on set hollywood is now luring hardernosed investors backing individual movies in the full expectation of an attractive return on equity other investors have sought ways to take positions in celebrities themselves thirteen years ago david bowie famously raised  million by issuing socalled bowie bonds paying  percent interest through album royalties and introducing the concept of securitized intellectual property now the model is proliferating in  mark cuban cofounded content partners to do for celebrities what structuredsettlement firms do for winners of lotteries and lawsuits pay an upfront lump sum in return for the right to future revenue cuban won’t name names but claims the venture has been �highly profitable� art capital group a highend pawnshop lends money to brandname artists who pledge their paintings and photographs as collateral over the past two years barrack has been lining up deals that target celebrities and entertainment properties whose value he believes to be artificially depressed in some cases that’s because they haven’t yet figured out a way to monetize their assets but mostly it’s because the investment is in the classic sense distressed�individuals like jackson or annie leibovitz whose financial mismanagement has obscured their future revenue potential or properties like the miramax film library which disney is unloading at a time when no one can agree on what a studio archive is worth this summer barrack created a new  million mediaandentertainment investment fund working with his friend rob lowe who is a partner in the fund together they have been on something of a shopping spree�and generating a little tabloid coverage while they’re at it in one tmz

trump’s favorite punching bags – the north american free trade agreement and the transpacific partnership he calls for new negotiations with canada and mexico on nafta as one could “ensure the benefits of trade outweigh its negative impact on american workers and strengthen the alliance among the three north american allies” in september  trump was more blunt calling nafta a “disaster” that he would try to “break” in his essay barrack makes the case against tpp barrack writes that studies showed american workers would not see the benefits of the trade partnership and doesn’t take into account how cheaper labor could be found overseas or how currency manipulation would hurt the us “the tpp will not only destroy our manufacturing but it will make america subject to the rulings of foreign governments” trump will say in his speech on july  at the convention via politico “i pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom and

washington post donald trump’s longtime friend thomas j barrack jr spoke glowingly about the republican presidential nominee last week in cleveland a california privateequity executive and founder of colony capital who has known the candidate for  years barrack praised trump’s leadership and perseverance and told stories about real estate development deals they have done together one deal that didn’t come up that night trump and barrack’s agreement to together develop the old post office in washington into a room luxury hotel a partnership that never came to be trump and colony bid for the project together and when the general services administration selected the two companies — beating out a bevy of other hotel and real estate bidders — federal officials expected that the trump organization would serve as the lead developer managing the daytoday aspects of the project and colony capital would provide financial backing the two firms issued a joint news release after being selected saying they would coinvest barrack said he was “delighted to team with the trump organization to redevelop this historic american landmark while preserving its grandeur and elegance” “as longterm investors in hospitality we share the gsa’s vision for transforming this iconic property into one of the finest destination hotels in the country we look forward to working with the trump organization and gsa to make the redevelopment a reality” he said in the news release how the trumps landed the old post office pavilion colony is a major global investor in real estate which bolstered trump’s efforts to secure the deal at the time colony had already invested  billion in more than  corporate and real estate assets ranking it among the top real estate investment firms worldwide most commercial real estate developments are built by similarly formed partnerships the arrangements allow multiple partners to share both the risks of a project and the potential returns if the project is successful but a year later trump said he and his daughter ivanka an executive at his company who leads the project were reconsidering trump told the washington post he was “considering colony and others” as investors and that “every bank wants to do this deal” “we don’t even need financing” trump said at an event hosted by the post “we could do it in cash” soon thereafter the trumps decided to put up the equity for the project themselves investing  million of what they say is their own money and borrowing about  million from deutsche bank to finance construction gsa officials have confirmed this arrangement tom barrack ceo of colony capital told the republican national convention that republican presidential candidate donald trump is wellversed enough to do it on his own merits the washington post colony decided to pull out although it made no announcement until monday when the company’s public relations agency issued a statement to the post that said “colony exited the joint venture after the project’s timeline became too long for the firm as the project evolved cheaper sources of capital for longer term investment became available to trump colony simply could not compete with more attractive financing” given the loan from deutsche bank this suited the trumps fine ivanka trump has said on a number of occasions she wanted to keep the company in her family for generations which is more easily achieved when their company controls the project on its own colony wasn’t interested in staying in that long ivanka and her family are now moving full steam ahead with the project toward a sept  opening the trump organization has been hiring staff booking events and showing the building off to travel agents as construction crews work through the last few weeks of construction chef david burke of blt prime is putting together a menu of steak and seafood offerings and italian suitmaker brioni will open its first dc location there colony’s exit will not look so good for trump however if the old post office deal goes sour — because then it will be his money to lose trump’s campaign has prompted some business partners to cut ties with him but afforded him worldwide brand recognition barrack meanwhile was given a prime slot at the republican convention preceding only ivanka before trump took the stage to accept the nomination barrack described trump as a relentless and disciplined businessman “he really is better than the billing that you see just as an administrator as an executive as a guy who can actually take care of the people that work for him and build teams” he said  follow jonathan o’connell on twitter oconnellpostbiz business capitalbusiness digger false afterth true please provide a valid email address sign up you’re all set see all
