county colorado in the denveraurora metropolitan area the company develops biobased alternatives to petroleumbased products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry gevo converts

markets  references  external links  further reading economics of isobutanol productionedit isobutanol is a fourcarbon c  alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a valueadded fuel blendstock it can also be converted into butenes using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics fibers rubber other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of c  hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries over the last decade fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum which is important to industrial c  consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleumderived materials isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately  percent of the global petrochemicals market manufacturers can replace petroleumderived raw materials with isobutanolderived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes additionally the final products produced from isobutanolbased raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleumbased raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption technology engineering and productionedit gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol gevo’s integrated fermentation technology or gift is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol gift consists of two components proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately  bgpy billion gallons per year of global operating ethanol production capacity as estimated by the renewable fuels association gift is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities enabling a rapid and costefficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over  million gallons of isobutanol by  demonstration facility in st joseph gevo’s production process was demonstrated in september  on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of icm’s  mgpymillion gallons per year ethanol facility in st joseph missouri this demonstration project illustrates that gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low upfront capital investment first commercial production facility in september  gevo acquired ownership of a  mgpy ethanol production facility in luverne minnesota gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the luverne facility in the fourth quarter of  commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the luverne facility in the first half of  target marketsedit most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics fibers rubber other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets isobutanol — without any modification isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock in the fuel blendstock market isobutanol can be used to replace highvalue blendstocks such as alkylate and can be blended in conjunction with or as a substitute for ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates in november  gevo became the first company to receive epa environmental protection agency certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the epa’s standards under the clean air act the global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately  bgpy based upon data from the international energy agency iea while isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol as a gasoline blendstock isobutanol’s low reid vapor pressure rvp high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure including pipeline assets isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent this global market for butanol represents approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri plastics fibers rubber and other polymers — isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products including rubber lubricants additives methyl methacrylate polypropylenes polyesters and polystyrene representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri cmai and nexant hydrocarbon fuels — alternatively the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel as well as other hydrocarbon fuels the hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over  bgpy based upon volume data from iea referencesedit  the postalcohol world the economist october   retrieved    leber

engineering and productionedit gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol gevo’s integrated fermentation technology or gift is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol gift consists of two components proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately  bgpy billion gallons per year of global operating ethanol production capacity as estimated by the renewable fuels association gift is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities enabling a rapid and costefficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over  million gallons of isobutanol by  demonstration facility in st joseph gevo’s production process was demonstrated in september  on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of icm’s  mgpymillion gallons per year ethanol facility in st joseph missouri this demonstration project illustrates that gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low upfront capital investment first commercial production facility in september  gevo acquired ownership of a  mgpy ethanol production facility in luverne minnesota gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the luverne facility in the fourth quarter of  commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the luverne facility in the first half of  target marketsedit most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics fibers rubber other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets isobutanol — without any modification isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock in the fuel blendstock market isobutanol can be used to replace highvalue blendstocks such as alkylate and can be blended in conjunction with or as a substitute for ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates in november  gevo became the first company to receive epa environmental protection agency certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the epa’s standards under the clean air act the global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately  bgpy based upon data from the international energy agency iea while isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol as a gasoline blendstock isobutanol’s low reid vapor pressure rvp high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure including pipeline assets isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent this global market for butanol represents approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri plastics fibers rubber and other polymers — isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products including rubber lubricants additives methyl methacrylate polypropylenes polyesters and polystyrene representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri cmai and nexant hydrocarbon fuels — alternatively the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel as well as other hydrocarbon fuels the hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over  bgpy based upon volume data from iea referencesedit  the postalcohol world the economist october   retrieved    leber

to produce isobutanol gevo’s integrated fermentation technology or gift is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol gift consists of two components proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately  bgpy billion gallons per year of global operating ethanol production capacity as estimated by the renewable fuels association gift is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities enabling a rapid and costefficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over  million gallons of isobutanol by  demonstration facility in st joseph gevo’s production process was demonstrated in september  on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of icm’s  mgpymillion gallons per year ethanol facility in st joseph missouri this demonstration project illustrates that gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low upfront capital investment first commercial production facility in september  gevo acquired ownership of a  mgpy ethanol production facility in luverne minnesota gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the luverne facility in the fourth quarter of  commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the luverne facility in the first half of  target marketsedit most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics fibers rubber other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets isobutanol — without any modification isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock in the fuel blendstock market isobutanol can be used to replace highvalue blendstocks such as alkylate and can be blended in conjunction with or as a substitute for ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates in november  gevo became the first company to receive epa environmental protection agency certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the epa’s standards under the clean air act the global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately  bgpy based upon data from the international energy agency iea while isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol as a gasoline blendstock isobutanol’s low reid vapor pressure rvp high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure including pipeline assets isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent this global market for butanol represents approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri plastics fibers rubber and other polymers — isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products including rubber lubricants additives methyl methacrylate polypropylenes polyesters and polystyrene representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri cmai and nexant hydrocarbon fuels — alternatively the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel as well as other hydrocarbon fuels the hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over  bgpy based upon volume data from iea referencesedit  the postalcohol world

external links  further reading economics of isobutanol productionedit isobutanol is a fourcarbon c  alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a valueadded fuel blendstock it can also be converted into butenes using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics fibers rubber other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of c  hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries over the last decade fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum which is important to industrial c  consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleumderived materials isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately  percent of the global petrochemicals market manufacturers can replace petroleumderived raw materials with isobutanolderived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes additionally the final products produced from isobutanolbased raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleumbased raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption technology engineering and productionedit gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol gevo’s integrated fermentation technology or gift is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol gift consists of two components proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately  bgpy billion gallons per year of global operating ethanol production capacity as estimated by the renewable fuels association gift is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities enabling a rapid and costefficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over  million gallons of isobutanol by  demonstration facility in st joseph gevo’s production process was demonstrated in september  on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of icm’s  mgpymillion gallons per year ethanol facility in st joseph missouri this demonstration project illustrates that gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low upfront capital investment first commercial production facility in september  gevo acquired ownership of a  mgpy ethanol production facility in luverne minnesota gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the luverne facility in the fourth quarter of  commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the luverne facility in the first half of  target marketsedit most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics fibers rubber other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets isobutanol — without any modification isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock in the fuel blendstock market isobutanol can be used to replace highvalue blendstocks such as alkylate and can be blended in conjunction with or as a substitute for ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates in november  gevo became the first company to receive epa environmental protection agency certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the epa’s standards under the clean air act the global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately  bgpy based upon data from the international energy agency iea while isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol as a gasoline blendstock isobutanol’s low reid vapor pressure rvp high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure including pipeline assets isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent this global market for butanol represents approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri plastics fibers rubber and other polymers — isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products including rubber lubricants additives methyl methacrylate polypropylenes polyesters and polystyrene representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri cmai and nexant hydrocarbon fuels — alternatively the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel as well as other hydrocarbon fuels the hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol

isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of c  hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries over the last decade fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum which is important to industrial c  consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleumderived materials isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately  percent of the global petrochemicals market manufacturers can replace petroleumderived raw materials with isobutanolderived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes additionally the final products produced from isobutanolbased raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleumbased raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption technology engineering and productionedit gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol gevo’s integrated fermentation technology or gift is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol gift consists of two components proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately  bgpy billion gallons per year of global operating ethanol production capacity as estimated by the renewable fuels association gift is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities enabling a rapid and costefficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over  million gallons of isobutanol by  demonstration facility in st joseph gevo’s production process was demonstrated in september  on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of icm’s  mgpymillion gallons per year ethanol facility in st joseph missouri this demonstration project illustrates that gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low upfront capital investment first commercial production facility in september  gevo acquired ownership of a  mgpy ethanol production facility in luverne minnesota gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the luverne facility in the fourth quarter of  commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the luverne facility in the first half of  target marketsedit most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics fibers rubber other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets isobutanol — without any modification isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock in the fuel blendstock market isobutanol can be used to replace highvalue blendstocks such as alkylate and can be blended in conjunction with or as a substitute for ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates in november  gevo became the first company to receive epa environmental protection agency certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the epa’s standards under the clean air act the global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately  bgpy based upon data from the international energy agency iea while isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol as a gasoline blendstock isobutanol’s low reid vapor pressure rvp high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure including pipeline assets isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent this global market for butanol represents approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri plastics fibers rubber and other polymers — isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products including rubber lubricants additives methyl methacrylate polypropylenes polyesters and polystyrene representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately  bgpy based upon volume data from sri cmai and nexant hydrocarbon fuels — alternatively the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel as well as other hydrocarbon fuels the hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over  bgpy based upon volume data from iea referencesedit  the postalcohol world
