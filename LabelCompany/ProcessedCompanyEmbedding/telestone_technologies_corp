tstc michael slattery special situations eventdriven mediumterm horizon technical analysisstockdotgeniethere are only a handful of chinese stocks that you can invest in with little or no concern about accounting accuracy reliable income sources and credible growth predictions here are some of the many reasons why this chinese company will outperform most if not all smallcap chinese growth stocks over the next few months and years and why it is absolutely a safe and credible investment the only caveat is the price to earning is so low  and a peg of  that it has sparked a discussion within the companys board on whether to buy up all of its outstanding shares and take the company private you win either way telestone nasdaqtstc services the vast and growing business of wireless telecoms and provides access infrastructure for its services smart phones and tablets are wireless based computers the entire world is moving to this platform as their primary or secondary works stations with this fact firmly established the infrastructure demands placed on all service providers public venues and all commercial buildings to facilitate this access will continue to grow exponentially for many years to come just one example of this explosive growth can be found in adam mullers seeking alpha article which projects that apple nasdaqaapl will sell world wide  million iphones in just the last quarter of  as this is only one product from one company it dramatically underscores how large the smartphone market is becoming and the incredible rate at which it is growing factor in another  million tablets since the ipads introduction on april   and you begin to see the scope of this paradigm shift in computing and communications there are projected to be  billion mobile phones in use by the end of this year this explosive growth puts telestones products at the very heart of the critical path to anywhere and anytime world wide mobile communications and computing the companys income has been primarily generated within china but that is rapidly changing as this article will demonstrate on its website telestone has direct links to what is currently its three largest partners china mobil nysechl china telecom nysecha and china unicom nysechu as a major provider to the three biggest china mobile telecom companies tstc is positioned to grow faster in a relative sense than the companies they serve by assisting mobile telecoms in building out infrastructure with new unique and innovative products unavailable from any other source telestone has guaranteed a large and growing share of these mobile goliaths businesses like apple telestone has devised new products that its customers were not even requesting the most current example of this innovative and aggressive approach to expanding its markets is called a wireless fiberoptic distribution system or wfds and it provides the ability to deliver the data services of several mobile telecoms such as sprint nyses att nyset and verizon nysevz combining them into one device and allowing each of their respective subscribers to access internet data including video text and voice this is not unlike a wireless router you probably are using at home right now but with the ability to provide large commercial venues with this full suite of services how many times have you been in a large commercial building like a hospital and could not get decent cell service wfds makes that problem a thing of the past the company has protected this innovative technology with over  patents here is how the company describes the product in regulatory filings compared with other traditional wireless distribution systems our wfds system has many advantages firstly wfds uses optical fiber to transport signals based on the low signalloss characteristic of fiber through which signals can be transmitted over long distances the main unit mu can be placed closer to the signal source and the remote unit ru can be placed closer to the subscribers therefore a micropower signal source can be used which reduces interference and noise generates low electromagnetic interference and expands the coverage area wfds systems can support multiple signals access and network integration wfds can provide all broadband communication services access in the khz to ghz band for subscribers thirdly due to the fact that each node of the system has the same bandwidth and flow characteristics wfds can provide the same communication services for every subscriber our rd capabilities have won accolades such as the project certificate of nationallevel torch program and the project certificate of nationlevel spark program in addition a number of our products and systems several of which have been patented or are patent pending have been awarded various science and technology honors by prc provincial and municipal governments  from form q for telestone technologies corp  may  here are a couple of prime examples where these installations are already being utilized click all images to enlarge telestone technologies awarded wfds contract for beijingshanghai highspeed rail project the contract calls for the installation of a wfdsenabled unified access network nyseuan solution and the corresponding proprietary equipment to satisfy the advanced communication needs all three carriers subscribers—china mobile chl china unicom chu and china telecomcha—for wireless broadband internet access as well as g and g wireless cellular coverage the us  million contract will cover project engineering and equipment supply and is scheduled for delivery by june   china’s telestones wins first us local access network contract for a houston hospital the memorial hermann healthcare system is the largest nonprofit system in texas with  employees working at  seperate sites you can see an image of each of their locations here telestones wfds installations in the initial three buildings now allows sprint verizon and att to have uninterrupted and unparalleled service full bars all the time to everyone in the hospital regardless off which carrier they subscribe to this is truly a revolutionary new advancement for large venue wireless access the initial contract has been satisfactorily completed because of the favorable reviews the hospital administrators have decided to install the wfds systems in the remaining  hospital buildings as this houston hospital contract clearly demonstrates the company is now expanding outside of china and has contracts signed already built out in development or in discussions within the us mexico argentina brazil and japan indeed one of the companys largest growing areas of new expenses is staffing new sales offices currently there are just over  million wireless wifi hotspots worldwide two of chinas mobile telecoms plan on more than doubling this number by the end of the year and more than tripling it thereafter the wifi alliance has identified over one billion users of this technology worldwide together these three chinese mobile telecoms have subscribers totaling over  billion here is the breakdown from a recent reuter’s article hong kong aug  reuters  china the worlds largest mobile phone market saw a  percent monthly increase in total number of mobile subscribers to  million in july data from the countrys three telecom operators showed  china mobile the countrys largest mobile carrier said its mobile subscribers in july increased to  million including  million g subscribers  china unicom the no  carrier said mobile subscribers rose to  million including  million g subscribers  mobile subscribers at china telecom the smallest of the three operators increased to  million including  million for g subscribers currently telestone is the sole developer of wfds technology and had installed over  systems by  year end producing  million is revenue the majority of telestones income emanated from the big china telecoms and accounted for  of its  revenues because its primary source of income is generated from rock solid worldclass businesses telestones income stream is unlikely to be disrupted the company has approximately  employees this company is positioned to dramatically grow profits in  to guarantee this telestone is building out a acre office manufacturing research and development campus south of beijing the artiest rendering demonstrates the scope of this aggressive expansion plan and the second picture provides the current state of the projects construction phase i of construction with the first six building nearing completion photo was taken on oct  because of the emerging tsunami in smartphone data usage telestone’s business plan of identifying large businesses public venues and transportation systems as well as telecom firms planning on upgrading their networks wireless distribution and access points positions it to capitalize in all of these markets and capture amazing profits telestone technologies has the tools teamand technology to accomplish exactly that at the current share price of  this is a strong buying opportunity as of march   telestone had  million in cash and equivalents and  million in shortterm debt the company raised  million in a secondary offering in november  and the company has access to a  million line of credit the companys financial statements are audited by a large multinational and well respected accounting firm mazars cpa limited chairman and ceo han has recently completed his second acquisition of a large block of telestone shares insider buying is always a valuable indicator of a
