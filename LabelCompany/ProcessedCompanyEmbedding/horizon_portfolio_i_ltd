indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing nsaid‐associated gastric ulcers vimovo is not recommended for initial treatment of acute pain because the absorption of naproxen is delayed compared to absorption from other naproxencontaining products controlled studies do not extend beyond  months limitations of use vimovo is not interchangeable with the individual components of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium important safety information warning risk of serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events cardiovascular thrombotic events nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids a component of vimovo cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events including myocardial infarction and stroke which can be fatal this risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use vimovo is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery gastrointestinal bleeding ulceration and perforation nsaids a component of vimovo cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal gi adverse events including bleeding ulceration and perforation of the stomach or intestines which can be fatal these events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease andor gi bleeding are at greater risk for serious gi events contraindications vimovo is contraindicated in patients

allergic‐type reactions after taking aspirin or other nsaids fatal anaphylactic reactions to nsaids have been reported in such patients in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery warnings and precautions use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cv thrombotic events associated with nsaid use vimovo can be administered with low‐dose aspirin ≤ mgday therapy the concurrent use of aspirin and an nsaid such as vimovo increases the risk of serious gi events as with all nsaids concurrent administration of naproxen and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding elevation of one or more liver tests may occur during therapy with nsaids vimovo should be discontinued immediately if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop vimovo is not recommended

increased risk of diarrhea associated with clostridium difficile infection and increased risk for osteoporosis‐related fractures of the hip wrist or spine avoid concomitant use of vimovo with other naproxencontaining products or other nonaspirin nsaids clopidogrel due to a reduction in plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel when using esomeprazole consider alternative anti‐platelet therapy st john’s wort or rifampin due to the potential reduction in esomeprazole levels methotrexate which may elevate andor prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate andor its
