financing costs and the net amortization of the above market lease noncash compensation expense acquisition related expenses provision for income taxes and the net effect of straightline rents and amortization of deferred revenue management believes that ffo ffo per unit affo affo per unit and adjusted ebitda are useful supplemental performance measures that have not been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods management believes that this is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and amortization expense and management believes that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straightline basis over time the company believes such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of the companys operating results in comparison to the operating results of other reits adjusted ebitda is useful to investors to further supplement affo and ffo and to provide investors a performance metric which excludes interest expense in addition to noncash items beginning with the third quarter of  the company revised its calculations of affo and adjusted ebitda for acquisitionrelated expenses while we do not label these expenses as nonrecurring infrequent or unusual management believes that it is helpful to adjust for these expenses when they do occur to allow for comparability of results between periods because each acquisition is and will be of varying size and complexity and may involve different types of expenses depending on the type of property being acquired and from whom this revision to such calculations had no significant impact on our affo and adjusted ebitda as reported in prior periods ffo ffo per unit affo affo per unit and adjusted ebitda do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by us gaap should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by us gaap and are not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs investors are also cautioned that ffo ffo per unit affo affo per unit and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other reits due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions
