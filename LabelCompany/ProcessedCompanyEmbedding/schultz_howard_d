italy he was struck by the number of coffee bars he encountered an idea then occurred to him starbucks should sell not just coffee beans but coffee drinks i saw something not only the romance of coffee but  a sense of community and the connection that people had to coffee—the place and one another schultz recalled and after a week in italy i was so convinced with such unbridled enthusiasm that i couldnt wait to get back to seattle to talk about the fact that i had seen the future schultzs enthusiasm for opening coffee bars in starbucks stores however wasnt shared by the companys creators we said oh no thats not for us siegl remembered throughout the s we served coffee in our store we even at one point had a nice big espresso machine behind the counter but we were in the bean business nevertheless schultz was persistent until finally the owners let him establish a coffee bar in a new store that was opening in seattle it was an instant success bringing in hundreds of people per day and introducing a whole new language—the language of the coffeehouse—to seattle in  but the success of the coffee bar demonstrated to the original founders that they didnt want to go in the direction schultz wanted to take them they didnt want to get big disappointed schultz left starbucks in  to open a coffee bar chain of his own il giornale which quickly garnered success two years

after a shareholder complained that starbucks had lost sales due its support for gay marriage the company had announced its support for a referendum to legalize gay union in the state of washington schultz responded not every decision is an economic decision despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time we did provide a  percent shareholder return over the last year i dont know how many things you invest in but i would suspect not many things companies products investments have returned  percent over the last  months having said that it is not an economic decision to me the lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people we employ over  people in this company and we want to embrace diversity of all kinds the ceo then added if you feel

culture to the united states and packaging it for mass consumption this maverick marketer transformed a littleknown fourstore chain in the leading retailer of specialty coffee in north americaborn in  schultz was raised in the rough and tumble bay view housing project in brooklyn new york his mother worked as a receptionist and his father held a variety of jobs none of which paid much or offered such basic benefits as medical coverage for him and his family when schultz was  his father lost his job as a diaperservice delivery driver after breaking his ankle at the time sick pay or even legally mandated disability assistance were luxuries to those in lowpaying jobs and in the ensuing months the family was literally too poor to put food on the table it was a memory that schultz would carry with him into adulthooddetermined to build a better life for himself schultz channeled his energy into high school sports and earned an athletic scholarship to northern michigan university after graduating with a bachelors degree in business in  schultz immediately began working in the sales and marketing division of xerox corp schultz excelled at xerox so much so that he attracted the attention of the swedish housewares company perstorp ab which recruited him at the age of  to be vice president and general manager of their american subsidiary hammerplast usawhile at hammerplast schultz noticed that a small seattle company named starbucks after the first mate in hermann melvilles classic moby dick was buying an unusually high number of hammerplasts espresso machines intrigued he flew to seattle to investigate and found four starbucks outlets originally founded in  as a single store near seattles famed pike street market starbucks sold freshly roasted gourmet coffee beans as well as teas spices and various coffeemaking accessoriesimpressed by schultzs energy and marketing skills starbucks owners gerald baldwin and gordon bowkerwho possessed very little business knowledgeasked schultz to become part of their operation enticed by their offer which included part ownership schultz joined starbucks as head of its marketing and retail operations in a year later during a vacation in italy schultz had what he has described as an epiphany while sitting at one of milans many espresso bars he realized that the coffee shop played an integral role in the social life of most italians it was a focal point for the neighborhood where friends met mingled and lingered at all hours of the day seeing this i thought to myself why not open a coffee bar in seattle  schultz recalls in an interview in the new york timesreturning to seattle schultz shared his epiphany with his fellow starbucks owners although coffee was brewed in the shops it was done so only at the request of customers and dispensed as free samples and baldwin and bowker were unwilling to move beyond the stores core product offeringsconvinced he had hit upon something big schultz left starbucks in  to open his own espresso bar called il giornale the daily the venture was a hit schultz wanted to open more shops but didnt have the funding he needed to expand in a quirky twist of fate a year later he learned that baldwin and bowker wished to sell their outlets so after rounding up investors from the seattle area schultz purchased the original starbucks chain for  million and merged the stores with his ownonce in charge schultz set out to completely overhaul starbucks according to his vision in addition to the percup basic brew he expanded starbucks offerings to include more exotic coffee beverages such as espresso cappuccino café latte iced coffee and café mocha he also sought to create a more appealing atmosphere for his customersthe proverbial clean welllighted place where they could relax and enjoy their coffee in comfortbut the most radical change schultz made was to improve the way his company dealt with its employees convinced that friendly efficient service would boost sales he instituted a training program designed to groom knowledgeable employees who would enjoy working behind a counter an occupation considered by many to be menial labor service is a lost art in americaits not viewed as a professional job to work behind a counter schultz says we dont believe that we want to provide our people with dignity and selfesteem so we offer tangible benefits among the benefits schultz offers is complete healthcare coverage to both full and parttime employees as well as stock options practices that are virtually unheard of in corporate america as a result of schultzs vision starbucks experienced unprecedented growth throughout the 9s blossoming from  stores in 9 to more than  stores in 9 and the company is on target to break the  billion in the year with annual sales topping  billion in  starbucks corp reigned as the nations no  specialty coffee retailer quite an impressive achievement for a bluecollar kid from the projects but despite starbucks phenomenal success what howard schultz seems most proud of is not how much he has earned but the kind of company he has created my dad was a bluecollar worker schultz explains in an inc magazine interview he didnt have health insurance or benefits and i saw firsthand the debilitating effect that had on him and on our family i decided if i was ever in the position to make a contribution to others in that way i would my greatest success has been that i got to build the kind of company my father never got to work for the benefit of benefitshoward schultz credits starbucks corps benefits policy as one of the keys to his companys dramatic growth by extending health benefits to all employees schultz has created a more dedicated work force and promoted an extremely high level of customer service he has also achieved a turnover rate that is less than half the average of other fastfood businesses saving the company countless thousands in training costs and enhancing its ability to attract and retain good employeesanother benefit that makes starbucks stand out from its competitors is its stockoption plan dubbed bean stock unlike most plans which are only available to top executives starbucks gives stock options to everyone in the company my aim was to give our employees a vested interest in the company schultz says and that i think has made all the difference cartoons and coffeeone of the true good guys of the business world howard schultzs philanthropic endeavors have extended beyond just helping his employees have better lives one of his major philanthropic concerns has been helping to improve literacy in america to this end in 9 starbucks formed an unprecedented partnership with pulitzer prizewinning cartoonist garry trudeau to create

like a neighborhood shop raise your hand if you remember when starbucks seemed cool anyone think back to before the planet groaned with  starbucks shops before the pumpkin spice lattes and the ciao amore cds before the strawberries  crème frappuccino ice cream the starbucks cream liqueur the pinkberryinspired sorbetto in short to before howard d schultz and his trentasize ambition turned a few coffeehouses here into the vast corporate empire of the bean the world has often seemed three espressos behind mr schultz — which is why the lowkey guy sitting in his office here doesn’t quite seem like howard schultz did he just say “but” as in “we have won in many ways but ” was that a “we” instead of an “i” a note of humility yes this is howard schultz the man who willed starbucks onto so many street corners — and then for a moment looked as if he might lose it all not even mr schultz could have predicted how starbucks would change our culture when its first shop opened here in pike place market on march   like it or not starbucks became for many of us what we talk about when we talk about coffee it changed how we drink it on a sofa with wifi or on the subway how we order it “for here grande twopump vanilla skinny extra hot latte” and what we are willing to pay for it  for the aforementioned in manhattan but during the depths of the recession starbucks nearly drowned in its caramel macchiato after decades of breakneck expansion under mr schultz tightfisted consumers abandoned it the company’s sales and share price sank so low that insiders worried starbucks might become a takeover target so after an eightyear hiatus an alarmed mr schultz returned as chief executive in january  he shut  shops mostly in the united states drastically cut costs and put the company back on course friends and colleagues say this hellish experience left mr schultz a changed man starbucks these people say is no longer “the howard schultz show” the adjective that many use to characterize his new self is “humble” — a word that few would have applied to him before “everything starbucks did in the past more or less had worked” mr schultz said in an interview in january at the company’s headquarters with a view of puget sound south of downtown seattle “every store we opened was successful every city every country” he continued “growth had a life of its own — and that’s ok when you’re hitting the cover off the ball every time but at some point nothing lasts forever” one thing hasn’t changed the man dreams big in that same interview mr schultz spoke of expanding into still more products and in markets like china he is pushing of all things a brand of instant coffee the words “starbucks coffee” were just removed from the company’s green mermaid logo because he wants to waltz his brand up and down the grocery aisles on thursday he announced that the company had struck a deal with green mountain coffee roasters to distribute starbucks coffee and teas for keurig singleserving systems shares of starbucks jumped nearly  percent on the news reaching their highest level since  the stock closed at  on friday mr schultz and his colleagues say starbucks will keep its feet on the ground this time but some outsiders have doubts detractors say starbucks long ago ceded its role as a gourmet tastemaker to become a “billionsandbillions served” chain like mcdonald’s starbucks — “charbucks” to those who complain that its heavily roasted coffee tastes burned — will never rekindle the old romance these people say “has anybody said they came back because people love the coffee again” asks bryant simon a history professor at temple university and author of “everything but the coffee learning about america from starbucks” “they came back because they’re remaking themselves as a brand that competes on value largely — a brand that’s everywhere easily accessible predictable” mr simon says howard schultz now  is a tall sinewy man with a toothy grin and a silky sales pitch he rarely sticks to script preferring to speak off the cuff whatever his audience in conversations he leans in locks eyes and gives the impression that right now there is no one else in the world he would rather be talking to when he speaks of “soul” and “authenticity” and “love” you could almost forget that he runs a multibilliondollar business that has become an uneasy symbol of globalization or that the british actor rupert everett once likened starbucks to a metastasizing cancer the story of mr schultz’s life and career has been told many times not least by mr schultz his second book “onward how starbucks fought for its life without losing its soul” is to be published on march 9 but some highlights bear repeating he grew up poor in the bay view housing projects in canarsie brooklyn received a football scholarship to northern michigan university and after a variety of jobs joined the fledging starbucks in  as head of marketing inspired by italy’s coffee culture he left starbucks and opened his own coffee shop then in  he bought starbucks which at the time had all of six shops by 9 starbucks had  shops by  it had  and that year mr schultz stepped aside as ceo and so it went for starbucks one success after another until the recession hit and exposed the company’s overreach to the world in december  mr schultz was worried that the starbucks brand was losing its luster and he and the board decided that in the new year they would push aside jim donald and announce that mr schultz would return as ceo that month mr schultz his wife sheri and their two children flew to hawaii for their annual getaway but on the beach in kona he just couldn’t relax he kept checking the company’s daily sales figures and was horrified to see that they were falling by double digits also in hawaii then was his friend michael dell who had recently returned to run dell inc on a long bicycle ride along the coast mr dell told mr schultz that when he returned to dell he wrote what he called a “transformational agenda” mr schultz then created his own plan for starbucks his goals were to fix troubled stores to rekindle an emotional attachment with customers and to make longerterm changes like reorganizing executives and revamping the supply chain he returned to seattle handed copies of his plan to the company’s senior executives and posed the big question are you in or are you out eight of those top  executives have since departed “what the company needed then was what he used to be to us — the innovation the refusal to not be a champion” says troy alstead the chief financial officer “a lot of people were questioning in that span before he came back ‘were we done’ and howard came back and it wasn’t even a question anymore” mr schultz usually rises at  am without an alarm downs a starbucks sumatran coffee at home followed by a short double latte or espresso macchiato from one of two starbucks stores he visits on his way to work he arrives in his office by  friends and colleagues agree that he is as fanatical as ever about starbucks millard drexler the chief executive of j crew recently emailed mr schultz to complain that the coffee lids at a starbucks on astor place in manhattan kept spilling coffee on his shirt mr schultz’s reply “on it” mr drexler who has a habit of emailing ceo’s with complaints says “i can give you many more examples when they say ‘i’ll send this to a research department or a gatekeeper’ ” but he says of starbucks “to have that kind of quality control they have around the world is pretty extraordinary” it was on such a morning in early  that mr schultz was convinced he had a product that would reenergize the company’s tired sales it was called sorbetto after the italian for “sorbet” and the drink was a twist on pinkberry the frozen yogurt chain in which mr schultz is an investor mr schultz had flown to italy to taste the ingredients of his new product and thought he had the next frappuccino by that summer  starbucks locations in california were bathed in pink to promote the new drink starbucks had shipped in ingredients from italy and mr schultz had primed investors but customers didn’t like the sugary concoction and neither did starbucks baristas who had to spend an hour and a half cleaning the sorbetto machines at the end of their shifts a few months later mr schultz abandoned sorbetto “sorbetto we did too quickly and that was my fault” mr schultz says the headlong introduction was a mistake but it was also classic schultz “he likes things moving quickly he likes people to be decisive he’s got this energy level this need for driving and for winning and i think at times it’s hard for some people to keep up” says michelle gass the president of seattle’s best coffee which starbucks owns after his missteps ms gass says mr schultz has become more disciplined and a better listener mr schultz concedes that he can no longer run starbucks through the cult of howard and he readily acknowledges that he badly misread the economy and underestimated the extent to which his customers would pull back during the recession at the time he says he had a hard time accepting that starbucks would become a poster child for excess after his return he halted new store openings and with a pr flourish closed every starbucks in the nation for three hours to retrain baristas the chain ran its biggest ad campaign ever emphasizing the quality and freshness of its coffee it ordered baristas to dump brewed coffee after  minutes but growth in samestore sales dipped below zero for the first time ever and the company’s share price kept falling it was a new feeling for mr schultz like the a student who breezes into college and then gets c’s executives concluded that starbucks had to close  american shops the board suggested  executives said that if sales and the economy got worse they would also cut  million in costs the board said no let’s start cutting costs immediately while closing locations starbucks ultimately closed  locations worldwide and cut  million in costs as the decline in samestore sales neared  percent board members asked executives to model what would happen if the sales slide hit  percent — which once would have been unthinkable “nobody knew where the bottom was” recalls james g shennan jr a venture capitalist who has been on the company’s board since 9 “the general agreement around the table was we better have the doomsday plan” in december  almost a year after he returned as ceo mr schultz flew to new york on the company jet he and his team were scheduled to meet with analysts from wall street where mr schultz once a darling was now being doubted as never before on the plane he reviewed the grim quarterly numbers profits were underwhelming and holiday sales looked dreadful just before the meeting the company’s chief financial officer pete bocian resigned mr schultz reread the script for the presentation — and didn’t like what he saw he worried that the stock price might drop so low that someone would swoop in and buy the company he summoned his executives to his fifth avenue apartment late into the night around the dining room table they revised the presentation the next day as the executives rehearsed mr schultz kept interrupting vivek varma who had recently joined starbucks as head of public affairs told him that he should leave no one could remember anyone talking like that to mr schultz but he left the next day he and the other executives painted a somber picture for analysts and laid out the recovery plans rather than plunge the company’s share price rose  cents that day over the next year starbucks made much deeper and more difficult changes than mr schultz had originally envisioned by april  samestore sales though still down from a year earlier were finally rising by the holidays they had turned positive instant coffee the very words leave a bad taste in many people’s mouths but starbucks has been developing instant coffee in earnest since  mr schultz says his industry considers instant a “death category” it is however a  billion one before he returned mr schultz complained that if apple could develop the ipod in less than a year starbucks could surely develop an instant coffee in that time finally in january  the new product via was scheduled for a fullscale introduction but there was a problem market research was showing that skeptical customers needed a lesson about instant coffee some executives worried that a big rollout might flop ms gass and a few others told mr schultz that starbucks should delay via and introduce it in two cities before going national “that was hard for him” ms gass says but rather than overrule his executives as he might have in the past mr schultz agreed it turned out to be the right decision after testing via in seattle and chicago starbucks rewrote the plan for a nationwide introduction for instance instead of just giving away free samples which customers forgot in the bottom of their briefcases purses and backpacks it prepared via in the stores and gave customers a blind taste test in  sales of via were over  million the instant coffee is now also sold in grocery stores and in britain canada japan and the philippines the methodical introduction of via offered a sharp contrast to the old howard schultz whose gut told him — wrongly — that sorbetto would be a winner but he has also gone so far as to embrace bigcompany ideas like focus groups which he used to shun delegating and accepting other people’s conclusions is now easier for him “there’s been more arguing challenging and debate in the last two to three years than there’s ever been” says mr alstead the chief financial officer mr schultz’s take “what leadership means is the courage it takes to talk about things that in the past perhaps we wouldn’t have because i’m not right all the time” born entrepreneurs are not necessarily born managers you need creativity and drive to start a company discipline and delegation to run one in the last year people who work closely with mr schultz say he has shown he can make the leap perhaps the bigger question is whether mr schultz can as he likes to say preserve starbucks’s soul or whatever soul it has left in a switch the company is designing new stores with local woods furniture and art to make them feel more like a neighborhood shop it is also buying specialty beans in limited supply as artisanal shops do whether starbucks can recapture a neighborhood feel as mr schultz insists is anyone’s guess for many people especially in areas where carefully made lighterroast coffee from the likes of stumptown and intelligentsia is trendy starbucks has become a place to go for free wifi or to use the restroom or to buy a coffee on the go there is a market for a convenient coffee chain as the recent starbucks sales rebound shows but some customers and analysts say that the massmarket approach conflicts with mr schultz’s vision of a global giant that somehow feels local everywhere mr simon of temple university says “when you’re selling stuff people don’t need you’ve got to be selling something else and that’s what starbucks lost there’s a kind of dissonance between the messaging and the actual practice” mr schultz no longer plans to blanket the united states with new starbucks stores sometimes with multiple locations on one block — a practice that inspired a contest on flickr to see how many starbucks shops people could fit into a single photograph instead like so many other executives he has his sights on china starbucks already has roughly  stores in mainland china and plans to have  there by  india beckons as well the company also plans to sell a wider variety of drinks and foods in grocery stores and its own shops like kind fruit and nut bars which starbucks put on the map it may be difficult to believe but there was a time when mcdonald’s was a novelty but like ray kroc who took over a small hamburger business and built it into the most successful fast food operation in the world mr schultz has learned that growth can be seductive and that it can exact a price starbucks and its leader are more measured than during his last stint in the corner office “i think we are very conscious of the things that we have done wrong over the years particularly when we just got caught up in the growth phase” says mr shennan the starbucks director “we are not going to do that again under howard’s management i tell you or the current board’s” in january three years after his return mr schultz stood before  employees at the headquarters here three thousand more from around the world were patched in via webcast the company had finished its strongest holiday season ever and mr schultz had just unveiled its new “coffee”less logo yet his words were laced with caution “we have won in many ways” he said “but i feel it’s so important to remind us all of how fleeting success and winning can be” a version of this article appeared in print on march   on page bu of the new york edition sign in to email print reprints get free email alerts on these topics starbucks corp

day we go to work hoping to do two things share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better it was true when the first starbucks opened in  and it’s just as true today back

by moby dick evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders in  howard schultz starbucks chairman and chief executive officer had first walked into a starbucks store from his first cup of sumatra howard was drawn into starbucks and joined a year later in  howard traveled to italy and became captivated with italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience he had a vision to bring the italian coffeehouse tradition back to the united states a place for conversation and a sense of community a third place between work and home he left

ragstoriches story of howard schultz  business insider strategy bi intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × from the projects to a  billion fortune — the inspiring ragstoriches story of starbucks ceo howard schultz shana lebowitz may    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print howard schultz is the ceo of starbucks one of the worlds most valuable brands spencer plattgetty growing up in new york city housing projects howard schultz says he never dreamed of going into business schultz certainly never imagined hed one day run a global coffee chain and have a net worth estimated at  billion according to wealthx the chairman and ceo of starbucks writes in his book pour your heart into it that he was raised in a workingclass jewish family in canarsie brooklyn while his mother elaine tended to him and his siblings fulltime she later became a receptionist his father fred held a series of bluecollar positions including truck driver factory worker and cab driver in  when schultz was  years old his father broke his ankle while working as a truck driver picking up and delivering diapers at the time fred had no health insurance or workers compensation and the family was left with no income today schultz writes he still remembers the way his father looked laying on the couch with his leg in a cast in a way his tremendous professional success is a tribute to his father who died years later and never attained fulfillment and dignity from work he found meaningful almost from the outset schultzs career path was different from his parents in high school he played football and earned an athletic scholarship to northern michigan university becoming the first college graduate in his family after graduation schultz landed a job in the sales training program at xerox where he got experience coldcalling and pitching word processors in a few years he took a job at hammarplast a housewares business owned by a swedish company called perstorp there schultz ascended the ranks to vice president and general manager leading a team of salespeople despite his seeming success schultz writes that he was getting antsy it may be a weakness in me im always wondering what ill do next or perhaps it was because he hadnt yet found what he would discover in starbucks what it means when your work truly captures your heart and your imagination the first starbucks store in pike place market in seattle the store opened in  retains its original facade and logo flickrromán emin schultz first encountered starbucks when he was working at hammarplast the coffee shop had four stores in seattle and caught his attention when it ordered an unusually large number of drip coffeemakers intrigued schultz traveled to seattle to meet the companys then owners gerald baldwin and gordon bowker he was struck by the partners passion and their courage in selling a product that would appeal only to a small niche of gourmet coffee enthusiasts joining starbucks would mean moving across the country and taking a significant pay cut but schultz was certain it would be the right move for him it took a year to persuade baldwin to hire him as the director of marketing schultzs career — and starbuckss fate — changed forever when the company sent him to an international housewares show in milan while walking around the city he encountered several espresso bars where owners knew their customers by name and served them drinks like cappuccinos and cafe lattes it was like an epiphany schultz writes of the moment he understood the personal relationship that people could have to coffee he was convinced that starbucks should start serving espresso drinks the italian way — that starbucks should be an experience and not just a store  baldwin and bowker however felt differently in  schultz decided to leave starbucks to start his own coffee company il giornale italian for the daily he spent two years away from starbucks wholly focused on opening il giornale stores that replicated the coffee culture hed seen in italy it caught on quickly in  il giornale bought starbucks and schultz became ceo of starbucks corporation throughout his career at starbucks schultzs first priority has been his employees wellbeing he says largely because of his fathers experience when he was injured schultz offered all his employees including parttime workers complete healthcare coverage as well as stock options last year starbucks announced it would pay for employees college tuition schultz has also been committed to maintaining the quality of his product in  when starbucks was struggling financially he temporarily closed  us stores in order to retrain baristas on how to make the perfect espresso over the next two years he led starbucks massive turnaround howard schultz attends a chinese starbucks opening in  getty today there are more than  starbucks stores in  countries and the company is valued at  billion although its been years since he was a college football player schultz writes that he still identifies with the persona of the bluecollar athlete whose determination and perseverance more than compensate for his lack of training ive always been driven and hungry schultz says long after others have stopped to rest and recover im still running chasing after

at home and abroad will undoubtedly have an effect on consumer confidence and … our customers are likely to experience an increased level of anxiety and concern” schultz wrote in his “message from howard” morning email which starbucks provided to the washington post “please recognize this and – as you always have – remember that our success is not an entitlement but something we need to earn every day” schultz continued “let’s be very sensitive to the pressures our customers may be feeling and do everything we can to individually and collectively exceed their expectations” schultz  has long been a believer in the greater social good achievable at the cappuccino machine he was the driving force behind starbucks’ ridiculed “race together” campaign which encouraged baristas to write the phrase on cups while talking with customers about america’s racial tensions that campaign was an outgrowth of the chain’s  “come together” campaign designed to urge lawmakers to avoid the fiscal cliff why starbucks chief howard schultz put himself at the center of america’s race debate the freespirited social pushes have helped cement schultz as one of the more outspoken — and as critics say tonedeaf — executives in corporate america’s typically taciturn upper ranks in  the brooklynborn billionaire told “ minutes” “we’re not in the business of filling bellies we’re in the business of filling souls” that executiveasstatesman social posturing has fueled speculation that he’s eyeing the presidency though schultz says he’d rather stay in business “despite the encouragement of others” he wrote earlier this month “i have no intention of entering the presidential fray” people keep asking starbucks ceo howard schultz if he’s running for president—and he keeps saying no it’s unclear just how many bad days were saved due to starbucks’ employees’ added compassion but the campaign is part of a broader push to catapult starbucks into the spotlight with a reputation that’s hard to buy as a warmhearted corporate behemoth who always keeps americans’ caffeine and personal needs in mind   the full memo is printed below to starbucks partners managing directors for companyoperated and joint venture markets date august   re message from howard leading through turbulent times dear partners during our year history as a public company we have experienced – and successfully

was even nicer than usual yesterday heres why by justin bariso justin bariso is an author and a consultant who helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact in  linkedin named him the “top voice” in “management and culture” his forthcoming book eq applied shares fascinating research modern examples and personal stories that illustrate how emotional intelligence works in the real world justinjbariso founder insightjustinjbariso  comments howard schultz credit getty images greatfallofchina that was one of the top trending hashtags on twitter yesterday after more than trillion was wiped from asian markets sending the dow plunging again it closed for the day down  points you could say the recent events have left a number of people  on edge this fact did not go unnoticed by howard schultz starbucks chief executive and he also made sure starbucks employees were well aware of the situationall  of them in a compelling memo sent yesterday the billionaire chairman eased employees partners in starbucksspeak worries and encouraged them to show special consideration for consumers our customers are likely to experience an increased level of anxiety and concern please recognize this andas you always haveremember that our success is not an entitlement but something we need to earn every day lets be very sensitive to the pressures our customers may be feeling and do everything we can to individually and collectively exceed their expectations you can read the memo in full below love him or hate him you have to give this to schultz he makes a difference critics say its too much for example they cite schultzs idea earlier this year that began starbucks race together campaign which asked baristas to start a conversation with customers about race relations in america by writing the phrase on togo coffee cups popular opinion ruled the concept illconceived and outoftouch one could similarly dismiss schultzs latest move as naive but im not one of those people heres what i think ceos and business owners everywhere can learn from schultzs email stay connected leadership and culture start at the top it would have been easy for schultz to read the news and move on neglecting the opportunity to have any type of impact on his employees its what the vast majority of ceos did yesterday but schultz took advantage of a great opportunity to exert positive influencein this case inspiring his people to improve their customer service on what would certainly be a depressing day for many if you wonder how much of a role that plays in the long run think about this how did starbucks become the largest coffeehouse company on earth is its coffee really so much better than everyone elses people around the world continue to seek the starbucks experience schultzs leadership with his attention to customer service is a big part of that dignify and praise others schultz and his communications team did an exceptional job in crafting yesterdays memo its not just the use of please and thank you its not the reassurance to workers that starbucks a public company is doing well and will continue to do so despite the market turmoil its not even about the praise schultz doles out to his employees  er partners when he says the strength and equity of our brand and the primary reason for our current and future success is because of all of you and i believe in you and have never been prouder to be your partner its not only one of those things its all of them which helps explain why schultz enjoys a 9 percent approval rating from starbucks employees on glassdoor this all inevitably leads to the following questions is howard schultz really the allaround nice guy that he seems to be judge for yourself is howard schultz a shrewd and savvy businessman and a remarkable ceo definitely here is yesterdays full memo as released by the washington post to starbucks partners managing directors for companyoperated and joint venture marketsdate
