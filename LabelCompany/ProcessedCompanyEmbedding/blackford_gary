from the countys small communities such as millgroves glass factory could be added to the count of  the countys two largest employers were glass factories american window glass plant number  and sneath glass company hartford citys resources low cost energy two railroads and workforce were especially favored by glass factories and a  directory lists  of themnote  in addition to an economic transformation another byproduct of the gas boom was an upgrade of blackford countys appearance many of the countys landmark buildings were constructed during the gas boom including the current courthouse and surrounding buildings in hartford citys courthouse square historic district the citys waterworks was also built during that period additional buildings include the carnegie library and historic presbyterian church in montpelier many of the buildings in its downtown historic district were also constructed during the gas boom montpeliers historic baptist church and montpeliers carnegie library were constructed in the early s – near the end of the gas boom postgas boomedit hartford citys waterworks built in  montpeliers historic baptist church built during montpeliers oil boom the indiana gas boom gradually came to an end during the first decade of the th century the end of the gas boom meant less prosperity for the county the gas and oil workers left some of the manufacturers moved and the service industries were forced to close or cut back operations because of fewer customers adding to the countys problems machines made the labor–intensive method originally used for producing window glass obsolete causing many of the countys skilled glass workers at the large american window glass plant to lose their jobs by  the window glass plant of the countys former largest employer was closednote  according to the united states census blackford countys population peaked at  in  and it still has not returned to that zenith over  years later the end of the gas boom was especially difficult for the smaller communities in the county since the loss of a single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than it did for a town with many businesses in the case of millgrove the communitys major manufacturer a glass factory closed for other communities such as mollie the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a waste of time and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished improvements to the automobile and highways which coincided with the end of the gas boom may have also contributed to the decline of the countys smaller communities the automobile changed business and shopping patterns at the expense of the smalltown merchant small town residents began to drive to larger communities to purchase goods because of the wider selection the improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads and interurban lines causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic in blackford county passenger service on the lake erie and western railroad line owned by the nickel plate road by that time was discontinued in  and the last interurban train ran on january   although the natural gas and oil workers left the area after the gas and oil boom montpeliers population eventually stabilized—and hartford citys grew some of the manufacturers remained in the countys two largest cities because of a lack of better alternatives hartford citys sneath glass company a major employer continued operations until the s hartford city leaders attracted businesses such as overhead door  and m  to replace some of the companies that left the area overhead door was a major employer in hartford city for over  years a major setback for the community involving overhead door occurred during the s although it began in the s during the s overhead door moved its headquarters from hartford city to dallas texas its hartford city manufacturing plant continued to be a major employer until the s when overhead door cut back local operations the hartford city facility finally closed in note  the county lost another major hartford city employer in  when the key plastics plant closed as  people lost their jobs agriculture continues to be an important factor in the countys economy over  percent of blackford countys land is occupied by soybean or corn fields additional crops and livestock are also raised good returns in agriculture are not always reflected in the economy of nearby towns as industrial agriculture has reduced the number of workers it needs and family farms have declined many small towns in the corn belt such as the communities in blackford county

years small communities slowly developed throughout the county when the countys rail lines were constructed in the s and s additional communities evolved around railroad stops beginning in the late s the discovery of natural gas and crude oil in the county and surrounding region caused the area to undergo an economic boom period known as the indiana gas boom manufacturers relocated to the area to take advantage of the lowcost energy and railroad facilities the boom period lasted about  years and is reflected in blackford countys population which peaked in  at  the new construction associated with the additional prosperity of the boom period caused a significant upgrade in the countys appearance as wooden buildings were replaced with structures made with brick and stone much of the infrastructure built during that time remains today—including montpeliers historic carnegie library and many of hartford citys buildings in the courthouse square historic district agriculture

settlers in the blackford county area living on the godfroy reserve after an  treaty the site is located in blackford countys harrison township east of montpelier although the godfroy reserve was allotted to miami indian chief francois aka francis godfroy delaware indians were also allowed to stay there the miami tribe was the most powerful group of indians in the region and francois godfroy who was half french was one of their chiefs by  godfroy had sold the reserve and the indians had migrated west benjamin reasoner was the first european–american to enter future blackford county and its first land owner he entered what would become licking township on july   reasoner and his sons built the countys first mill which was located on the family farm for a brief period the land that would become blackford county was the western part of jay county an act of the indiana general assembly which was approved january   created jay county effective after march   in december  a motion was made in the indiana house of representatives to review dividing jay county but that resolution was not adopted two blackford county communities matamoras and montpelier originally existed as part of jay county both of these communities are located along the salamonie river in what became the northeast portion of blackford county john blount founded matamoras arriving in note  this village is blackford countys oldest community and is the site of the countys largest water mill the mill constructed around  was considered one of the finest in the state blackford countys other former jay

natives named the settlement after the capital of their home state montpelier blackford countys montpelier was platted in  before matamoras and is the countys oldest platted community several sources claim blackford county was created in note  however the law was not finalized until  indiana bill of the house no  was originally for the creation of a county named windsor the name windsor was replaced with the name blackford by the house of representatives in january  an act for the formation of the county of blackford was approved on february   this act intended that the county would be open for business on the first monday in april  which was april  however the county was not organized finally on january   the original february  act was amended stating that blackford county shall enjoy the rights and privileges of an independent county the act also appointed commissioners and corrected a misprint that defined the southeast corner of the new countynote  over the next two years a political battle continued over the location of the county seat the tiny community of hartford was repeatedly selected by the commissioners but those decisions were challenged by individuals favoring montpelier while licking township location of community of hartford was the most populous township in the county the community of montpelier was the countys oldest platted community after a third and fourth act of the indiana general assembly hartford was finalized as the location of the county seat—and construction of a courthouse began because it was discovered that another community in indiana was also named hartford blackford countys hartford was eventually renamed hartford city during the next  years the county grew slowly plans were made for roads and railroads and swampland was drained the first railroad line was authorized in  the plan was for the fort wayne  southern railroad company to connect the indiana cities of fort wayne and muncie—running north–south through the blackford county communities of montpelier and hartford city although work constructing the railroad line began in the s it was not completed by connecting fort wayne to muncie until  and this delay caused it to be the second railroad to operate in blackford county by the time the railroad began operations it was named fort wayne cincinnati  louisville railroad the lake erie and western railroad acquired this railroad in note  the first railroad to operate in blackford county crossed somewhat east–west through the countys southern half the railroad was named union and logansport railroad company by the time it entered blackford county this line was proposed in  and completed to hartford city in —running through the blackford county communities of dunkirk crumleys crossing and hartford city the small community of crumleys crossing was renamed converse and two other communities millgrove and renner became established on this line the railroad was eventually named pittsburgh cincinnati and st louis railroad other names for the railroad since that time include the panhandle division of the pennsylvania railroad penn central railroad company conrail and norfolk southern railway a portion of this line is now abandoned and the track has been removed between converse and hartford city south of state road  gas boomedit see also indiana gas boom blackford county in  with western portion of jay county east of blackford and northeast corner of delaware county south of blackford in  natural gas was discovered in two counties adjacent to blackford county the discoveries were in the small community of eaton south of hartford city along railroad line in delaware county and in the city of portland in jay county east of hartford city and millgrove the hartford city gas  oil company was formed in early  and successfully drilled a natural gas well later in the year in montpelier the montpelier gas  oil mining company was organized in the spring of  while natural gas was found throughout blackford county crude oil was found mostly in the countys harrison township somewhat between montpelier and mollie blackford countys first successful oil well located just south of montpelier began producing during  montpelier was thought to be the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world oil was also found in parts of washington township including a well that was thought to be the most phenomenal well ever drilled in america by  blackford county had  natural gas companies these companies were headquartered in all four of the countys townships including the communities of hartford city montpelier roll dunkirk trenton priam post office and millgrove in june  only  people held manufacturing jobs in blackford county the indiana gas boom transformed the region as manufacturers moved to the area to utilize the natural gas and railroad system during  indiana state inspectors visited  manufacturing facilities in blackford county and these companies employed  people compare to  two decades earlier since these inspections were in hartford city and montpelier only additional manufacturing employees from the countys small communities such as millgroves glass factory could be added to the count of  the countys two largest employers were glass factories american window glass plant number  and sneath glass company hartford citys resources low cost energy two railroads and workforce were especially favored by glass factories and a  directory lists  of themnote  in addition to an economic transformation another byproduct of the gas boom was an upgrade of blackford countys appearance many of the countys landmark buildings were constructed during the gas boom including the current courthouse and surrounding buildings in hartford citys courthouse square historic district the citys waterworks was also built during that period additional buildings include the carnegie library and historic presbyterian church in montpelier many of the buildings in its downtown historic district were also constructed during the gas boom montpeliers historic baptist church and montpeliers carnegie library were constructed in the early s – near the end of the gas boom postgas boomedit hartford citys waterworks built in  montpeliers historic baptist church built during montpeliers oil boom the indiana gas boom gradually came to an end during the first decade of the th century the end of the gas boom meant less prosperity for the county the gas and oil workers left some of the manufacturers moved and the service industries were forced to close or cut back operations because of fewer customers adding to the countys problems machines made the labor–intensive method originally used for producing window glass obsolete causing many of the countys skilled glass workers at the large american window glass plant to lose their jobs by  the window glass plant of the countys former largest employer was closednote  according to the united states census blackford countys population peaked at  in  and it still has not returned to that zenith over  years later the end of the gas boom was especially difficult for the smaller communities in the county since the loss of a single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than it did for a town with many businesses in the case of millgrove the communitys major manufacturer a glass factory closed for other communities such as mollie the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a waste of time and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished improvements to the automobile and highways which coincided with the end of the gas boom may have also contributed to the decline of the countys smaller communities the automobile changed business and shopping patterns at the expense of the smalltown merchant small town residents began to drive to larger communities to purchase goods because of the wider selection the improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads and interurban lines causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic in blackford county passenger service on the lake erie and western railroad line owned by the nickel plate road by that time was discontinued in  and the last interurban train ran on january   although the natural gas and oil workers left the area after the gas and oil boom montpeliers population eventually stabilized—and hartford citys grew some of the manufacturers remained in the countys two largest cities because of a lack of better alternatives hartford citys sneath glass company a major employer continued operations until the s hartford city leaders attracted businesses such as overhead door  and m  to replace some of the companies that left the area overhead door was a major employer in hartford city for over  years a major setback for the community involving overhead door occurred during the s although it began in the s during the s overhead door moved its headquarters from hartford city to dallas texas its hartford city manufacturing plant continued to be a major employer until the s when overhead door cut back local operations the hartford city facility finally closed in note  the county lost another major hartford city employer in  when the key plastics plant closed as  people lost their jobs agriculture continues to be an important factor in the countys economy over  percent of blackford countys land is occupied by soybean or corn fields additional crops and livestock are also raised good returns in agriculture are not always reflected in the economy of nearby towns as industrial agriculture has reduced the number of workers it needs and family farms have declined many small towns in the corn belt such as the communities in blackford county continue to decline in

years small communities slowly developed throughout the county when the countys rail lines were constructed in the s and s additional communities evolved around railroad stops beginning in the late s the discovery of natural gas and crude oil in the county and surrounding region caused the area to undergo an economic boom period known as the indiana gas boom manufacturers relocated to the area to take advantage of the lowcost energy and railroad facilities the boom period lasted about  years and is reflected in blackford countys population which peaked in  at  the new construction associated with the additional prosperity of the boom period caused a significant upgrade in the countys appearance as wooden buildings were replaced with structures made with brick and stone much of the

its first land owner he entered what would become licking township on july   reasoner and his sons built the countys first mill which was located on the family farm for a brief period the land that would become blackford county was the western part of jay county an act of the indiana general assembly which was approved january   created jay county effective after march   in december  a motion was made in the indiana house of representatives to review dividing jay county but that resolution was not adopted two blackford county communities matamoras and montpelier originally existed as part of jay county both of these communities are located along the salamonie river in what became the northeast portion of blackford county john blount founded matamoras arriving in note  this village is

natives named the settlement after the capital of their home state montpelier blackford countys montpelier was platted in  before matamoras and is the countys oldest platted community several sources claim blackford county was created in note  however the law was not finalized until  indiana bill of the house no  was originally for the creation of a county named windsor the name windsor was replaced with the name blackford by the house of representatives in january  an act for the formation of the county of blackford was approved on february   this act intended that the county would be open for business on the first monday in april  which was april  however the county was not organized finally on january   the original february  act was amended stating that blackford county shall enjoy the rights and privileges of an independent county the act also appointed commissioners and corrected a misprint that defined the southeast corner of the new countynote  over the next two years a political battle continued over the location of the county seat the tiny community of hartford was repeatedly selected by the commissioners but those decisions were challenged by individuals favoring montpelier while licking township location of community of hartford was the most populous township in the county the community of montpelier was the countys oldest platted community after a third and fourth act of the indiana general assembly hartford was finalized as the location of the county seat—and construction of a courthouse began because it was discovered that another community in indiana was also named hartford blackford countys hartford was eventually renamed hartford city during the next  years the county grew slowly plans were made for roads and railroads and swampland was drained the first railroad line was authorized in  the plan was for the fort wayne  southern railroad company to connect the indiana cities of fort wayne and muncie—running north–south through the blackford county communities of montpelier and hartford city although work constructing the railroad line began in the s it was not completed by connecting fort wayne to muncie until  and this delay caused it to be the second railroad to operate in blackford county by the time the railroad began operations it was named fort wayne cincinnati  louisville railroad the lake erie and western railroad acquired this railroad in note  the first railroad to operate in blackford county crossed somewhat east–west through the countys southern half the railroad was named union and logansport railroad company by the time it entered blackford county this line was proposed in  and completed to hartford city in —running through the blackford county communities of dunkirk crumleys crossing and hartford city the small community of crumleys crossing was renamed converse and two other communities millgrove and renner became established on this line the railroad was eventually named pittsburgh

western portion of jay county east of blackford and northeast corner of delaware county south of blackford in  natural gas was discovered in two counties adjacent to blackford county the discoveries were in the small community of eaton south of hartford city along railroad line in delaware county and in the city of portland in jay county east of hartford city and millgrove the hartford city gas  oil company was formed in early  and successfully drilled a natural gas well later in the year in montpelier the montpelier gas  oil mining company was organized in the spring of  while natural gas was found throughout blackford county crude oil was found mostly in the countys harrison township somewhat between montpelier and mollie blackford countys first successful oil well located just south of montpelier began producing during  montpelier was thought to be the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world oil was also found in parts of washington township including a well that was thought to be the most phenomenal well ever drilled in america by  blackford county had  natural gas companies these companies were headquartered in all four of the countys townships including the communities of hartford city montpelier roll dunkirk trenton priam post office and millgrove in june  only  people held manufacturing jobs in blackford county the indiana gas boom transformed the region as manufacturers moved to the area to utilize the natural gas and railroad system during  indiana state inspectors visited  manufacturing facilities in blackford county and these companies employed  people compare to  two decades earlier since these inspections were in hartford city and montpelier only additional manufacturing employees from the countys small communities such as millgroves glass factory could be added to the count of  the countys two largest employers were glass factories american window glass plant number  and sneath glass company hartford citys resources low cost energy two railroads and workforce were especially favored by glass factories and a  directory lists  of themnote  in addition to an economic transformation another byproduct of the gas boom was an upgrade of blackford countys appearance many of the countys landmark buildings were constructed during the gas boom including the current courthouse and surrounding buildings in hartford citys courthouse square historic district the citys waterworks was also built during that period additional buildings include the carnegie library and historic presbyterian church in montpelier many of the buildings in its downtown historic district were also constructed during the gas boom montpeliers historic baptist church and montpeliers carnegie library were constructed in the early s – near the end of the gas boom postgas boomedit hartford citys waterworks built in  montpeliers historic baptist church built during montpeliers oil boom the indiana gas boom gradually came to an end during the first decade of the th century the end of the gas boom meant less prosperity for the county the gas and oil workers left some of the manufacturers moved and the service industries were forced to close or cut back operations because of fewer customers adding to the countys problems machines made the labor–intensive method originally used for producing window glass obsolete causing many of the countys skilled glass workers at the large american window glass plant to lose their jobs by  the window glass plant of the countys former largest employer was closednote  according to the united states census blackford countys population peaked at  in  and it still has not returned to that zenith over  years later the end of the gas boom was especially difficult for the smaller communities in the county since the loss of a single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than it did for a town with many businesses in the case of millgrove the communitys major manufacturer a glass factory closed for other communities such as mollie the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a waste of time and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished improvements to the automobile and highways which coincided with the end of the gas boom may have also contributed to the decline of the countys smaller communities the automobile changed business and shopping patterns at the expense of the smalltown merchant small town residents began to drive to larger communities to purchase goods because of the wider selection the improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads and interurban lines causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic in blackford county passenger service on the lake erie and western railroad line owned by the nickel plate road by that time was discontinued in  and the last interurban train ran on january   although the natural gas and oil workers left the area after the gas and oil boom montpeliers population eventually stabilized—and hartford citys grew some of the manufacturers remained in the countys two largest cities because of a lack of better alternatives hartford citys sneath glass company a major employer continued operations until the s hartford city leaders attracted businesses such as overhead door  and m  to replace some of the companies that left the area overhead door was a major employer in hartford city for over  years a major setback for the community involving overhead door occurred during the s although it began in the s during the s overhead door moved its headquarters from hartford city to dallas texas its hartford city manufacturing plant continued to be a major employer until the s when overhead door cut back local operations the hartford city facility finally closed in note  the county lost another major hartford city employer in  when the key plastics plant closed as  people lost their jobs agriculture continues to be an important factor in the countys economy over  percent of blackford countys land is occupied by soybean or corn fields additional crops and livestock are also raised good returns in agriculture are not always reflected in the economy of nearby towns as industrial agriculture has reduced the number of workers it needs and family farms have declined many small towns in the corn belt such as the communities in blackford county continue to decline in

blackford county communities of montpelier and hartford city although work constructing the railroad line began in the s it was not completed by connecting fort wayne to muncie until  and this delay caused it to be the second railroad to operate in blackford county by the time the railroad began operations it was named fort wayne cincinnati  louisville railroad the lake erie and western railroad acquired this railroad in note  the first railroad to operate in blackford county crossed somewhat east–west through the countys southern half the railroad was named union and logansport railroad company by the time it entered blackford county this line was proposed in  and completed to hartford city in —running through the blackford county communities of dunkirk crumleys crossing and hartford city the small community of crumleys crossing was renamed converse and two other communities millgrove and renner became established on this line the railroad was eventually named pittsburgh cincinnati and st louis railroad other names for the railroad since that time include the panhandle division of the pennsylvania railroad penn central railroad company conrail and norfolk southern railway a portion of this line is now abandoned and the track has been removed between converse and hartford city south of state road  gas boomedit see also indiana gas boom blackford county in  with western portion of jay county east of blackford and northeast corner of delaware county south of blackford in  natural gas was discovered in two counties adjacent to blackford county the discoveries were in the small community of eaton south of hartford city along railroad line in delaware county and in the city of portland in jay county east of hartford city and millgrove the hartford city gas  oil company was formed in early  and successfully drilled a natural gas well later in the year in montpelier the montpelier gas  oil mining company was organized in the spring of  while natural gas was found throughout blackford county crude oil was found mostly in the countys harrison township somewhat between montpelier and mollie blackford countys first successful oil well located just south of montpelier began producing during  montpelier was thought to be the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world oil was also found in parts of washington township including a well that was thought to be the most phenomenal well ever drilled in america by  blackford county had  natural gas companies these companies were headquartered in all four of the countys townships including the communities of hartford city montpelier roll dunkirk trenton priam post office and millgrove in june  only  people held manufacturing jobs in blackford county the indiana gas boom transformed the region as manufacturers moved to the area to utilize the natural gas and railroad system during  indiana state inspectors visited  manufacturing facilities in blackford county and these companies employed  people compare to  two decades earlier since these inspections were in hartford city and montpelier only additional manufacturing employees from the countys small communities such as millgroves glass factory could be added to the count of  the countys two largest employers were glass factories american window glass plant number  and sneath glass company hartford citys resources low cost energy two railroads and workforce were especially favored by glass factories and a  directory lists  of themnote  in addition to an economic transformation another byproduct of the gas boom was an upgrade of blackford countys appearance many of the countys landmark buildings were constructed during the gas boom including the current courthouse and surrounding buildings in hartford citys courthouse square historic district the citys waterworks was also built during that period additional buildings include the carnegie library and historic presbyterian church in montpelier many of the buildings in its downtown historic district were also constructed during the gas boom montpeliers historic baptist church and montpeliers carnegie library were constructed in the early s – near the end of the gas boom postgas boomedit hartford citys waterworks built in  montpeliers historic baptist church built during montpeliers oil boom the indiana gas boom gradually came to an end during the first decade of the th century the end of the gas boom meant less prosperity for the county the gas and oil workers left some of the manufacturers moved and the service industries were forced to close or cut back operations because of fewer customers adding to the countys problems machines made the labor–intensive method originally used for producing window glass obsolete causing many of the countys skilled glass workers at the large american window glass plant to lose their jobs by  the window glass plant of the countys former largest employer was closednote  according to the united states census blackford countys population peaked at  in  and it still has not returned to that zenith over  years later the end of the gas boom was especially difficult for the smaller communities in the county since the loss of a single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than it did for a town with many businesses in the case of millgrove the communitys major manufacturer a glass factory closed for other communities such as mollie the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a waste of time and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished improvements to the automobile and highways which coincided with the end of the gas boom may have also contributed to the decline of the countys smaller communities the automobile changed business and shopping patterns at the expense of the smalltown merchant small town residents began to drive to larger communities to purchase goods because of the wider selection the improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads and interurban lines causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic in blackford county passenger service on the lake erie and western railroad line owned by the nickel plate road by that time was discontinued in  and the last interurban train ran on january   although the natural gas and oil workers left the area after the gas and oil boom montpeliers population eventually stabilized—and hartford citys grew some of the manufacturers remained in the countys two largest cities because of a lack of better alternatives hartford citys sneath glass company a major employer continued operations until the s hartford city leaders attracted businesses such as overhead door  and m  to replace some of the companies that left the area overhead door was a major employer in hartford city for over  years a major setback for the community involving overhead door occurred during the s although it began in the s during the s overhead door moved its headquarters from hartford city to dallas texas its hartford city manufacturing plant continued to be a major employer until the s when overhead door cut back local operations the hartford city facility finally closed in note  the county lost another major hartford city employer in  when the key plastics plant closed as  people lost their jobs agriculture continues to be an important factor in the countys economy over  percent of blackford countys land is occupied by soybean or corn fields additional crops and livestock are also raised good returns in agriculture are not always reflected in the economy of nearby towns as industrial agriculture has reduced the number of workers it needs and family farms have declined many small towns in the corn belt such as the communities in blackford county continue to decline in

years small communities slowly developed throughout the county when the countys rail lines were constructed in the s and s additional communities evolved around railroad stops beginning in the late s the discovery of natural gas and crude oil in the county and surrounding region caused the area to undergo an economic boom period known as the indiana gas boom manufacturers relocated to the area to take advantage of the lowcost energy and railroad facilities the boom period lasted about  years and is reflected in blackford countys population which peaked in  at  the new construction associated with the additional prosperity of the boom period caused a significant upgrade in the countys appearance as wooden buildings were replaced with structures made with brick and stone much of the infrastructure built during that time remains today—including montpeliers historic carnegie library and many of hartford citys buildings in the courthouse square historic district agriculture

settlers in the blackford county area living on the godfroy reserve after an  treaty the site is located in blackford countys harrison township east of montpelier although the godfroy reserve was allotted to miami indian chief francois aka francis godfroy delaware indians were also allowed to stay there the miami tribe was the most powerful group of indians in the region and francois godfroy

its first land owner he entered what would become licking township on july   reasoner and his sons built the countys first mill which was located on the family farm for a brief period the land that would become blackford county was the western part of jay county an act of the indiana general assembly which was approved january   created jay county effective after march   in december  a motion was made in the indiana house of representatives to review dividing jay county but that resolution was not adopted two blackford county communities matamoras and montpelier originally existed as part of jay county both of these communities are located along the salamonie river in what became the northeast portion of blackford county john blount founded matamoras arriving in note  this village is

natives named the settlement after the capital of their home state montpelier blackford countys montpelier was platted in  before matamoras and is the countys oldest platted community several sources claim blackford county was created in note  however the law was not finalized until  indiana bill of the house no  was originally for the creation of a county named windsor the name windsor was replaced with the name blackford by the house of representatives in january  an act for the formation of the county of blackford was approved on february   this act intended that the county would be open for business on the first monday in april  which was april  however the county was not organized finally on january   the original february  act was amended stating that blackford county shall enjoy the rights and privileges of an independent county the act also appointed commissioners and corrected a misprint that defined the southeast corner of the new countynote  over the next two years a political battle continued over the location of the county seat the tiny community of hartford was repeatedly selected by the commissioners but those decisions were challenged by individuals favoring montpelier while licking township location of community of hartford was the most populous township in the county the community of montpelier was the countys oldest platted community after a third and fourth act of the indiana general assembly hartford was finalized as the location of the county seat—and construction of a courthouse began because it was discovered that another community in indiana was also named hartford blackford countys hartford was eventually renamed hartford city during the next  years the county grew slowly plans were made for roads and railroads and swampland was drained the first railroad line was authorized in  the plan was for the fort wayne  southern railroad company to connect the indiana cities of fort wayne and muncie—running north–south through the blackford county communities of montpelier and hartford city although work constructing the railroad line began in the s it was not completed by connecting fort wayne to muncie until  and this delay caused it to be the second railroad to operate in blackford county by the time the railroad began operations it was named fort wayne cincinnati  louisville railroad the lake erie and western railroad acquired this railroad in note  the first railroad to operate in blackford county crossed somewhat east–west through the countys southern half the railroad was named union and logansport railroad company by the time it entered blackford county this line was proposed in  and completed to hartford city in —running through the blackford county communities of dunkirk crumleys crossing and hartford city the small community of crumleys crossing was renamed converse and two other communities millgrove and renner became established on this line the railroad was eventually named pittsburgh cincinnati and st louis railroad other names for the railroad since that time include the panhandle division of the pennsylvania railroad penn central railroad company conrail and norfolk southern railway a portion of this line is now abandoned and the track has been removed between converse and hartford city south of state road  gas boomedit see also indiana gas boom blackford county in  with western portion of jay county east of blackford and northeast corner of delaware county south of blackford in  natural gas was discovered in two counties adjacent to blackford county the discoveries were in the small community of eaton south of hartford city along railroad line in delaware county and in the city of portland in jay county east of hartford city and millgrove the hartford city gas  oil company was formed in early  and successfully drilled a natural gas well later in the year in montpelier the montpelier gas  oil mining company was organized in the spring of  while natural gas was found throughout blackford county crude oil was found mostly in the countys harrison township somewhat between montpelier and mollie blackford countys first successful oil well located just south of montpelier began producing during  montpelier was thought to be the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world oil was also found in parts of washington township including a well that was thought to be the most phenomenal well ever drilled in america by  blackford county had  natural gas companies these companies were headquartered in all four of the countys townships including the communities of hartford city montpelier roll dunkirk trenton priam post office and millgrove in june  only  people held manufacturing jobs in blackford county the indiana gas boom transformed the region as manufacturers moved to the area to utilize the natural gas and railroad system during  indiana state inspectors visited  manufacturing facilities in blackford county and these companies employed  people compare to  two decades earlier since these inspections were in hartford city and montpelier only additional manufacturing employees from the countys small communities such as millgroves glass factory could be added to the count of  the countys two largest employers were glass factories american window glass plant number  and sneath glass company hartford citys resources low cost energy two railroads and workforce were especially favored by glass factories and a  directory lists  of themnote  in addition to an economic transformation another byproduct of the gas boom was an upgrade of blackford countys appearance many of the countys landmark buildings were constructed during the gas boom including the current courthouse and surrounding buildings in hartford citys courthouse square historic district the citys waterworks was also built during that period additional buildings include the carnegie library and historic presbyterian church in montpelier many of the buildings in its downtown historic district were also constructed during the gas boom montpeliers historic baptist church and montpeliers carnegie library were constructed in the early s – near the end of the gas boom postgas boomedit hartford citys waterworks built in  montpeliers historic baptist church built during montpeliers oil boom the indiana gas boom gradually came to an end during the first decade of the th century the end of the gas boom meant less prosperity for the county the gas and oil workers left some of the manufacturers moved and the service industries were forced to close or cut back operations because of fewer customers adding to the countys problems machines made the labor–intensive method originally used for producing window glass obsolete causing many of the countys skilled glass workers at the large american window glass plant to lose their jobs by  the window glass plant of the countys former largest employer was closednote  according to the united states census blackford countys population peaked at  in  and it still has not returned to that zenith over  years later the end of the gas boom was especially difficult for the smaller communities in the county since the loss of a single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than it did for a town with many businesses in the case of millgrove the communitys major manufacturer a glass factory closed for other communities such as mollie the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a waste of time and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished improvements to the automobile and highways which coincided with the end of the gas boom may have also contributed to the decline of the countys smaller communities the automobile changed business and shopping patterns at the expense of the smalltown merchant small town residents began to drive to larger communities to purchase goods because of the wider selection the improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads and interurban lines causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic in blackford county passenger service on the lake erie and western railroad line owned by the nickel plate road by that time was discontinued in  and the last interurban train ran on january   although the natural gas and oil workers left the area after the gas and oil boom montpeliers population eventually stabilized—and hartford citys grew some of the manufacturers remained in the countys two largest cities because of a lack of better alternatives hartford citys sneath glass company a major employer continued operations until the s hartford city leaders attracted businesses such as overhead door  and m  to replace some of the companies that left the area overhead door was a major employer in hartford city for over  years a major setback for the community involving overhead door occurred during the s although it began in the s during the s overhead door moved its headquarters from hartford city to dallas texas its hartford city manufacturing plant continued to be a major employer until the s when overhead door cut back local operations the hartford city facility finally closed in note  the county lost another major hartford city employer in  when the key plastics plant closed as  people lost their jobs agriculture continues to be an important factor in the countys economy over  percent of blackford countys land is occupied by soybean or corn fields additional crops and livestock are also raised good returns in agriculture are not always reflected in the economy of nearby towns as industrial agriculture has reduced the number of workers it needs and family farms have declined many small towns in the corn belt such as the communities in blackford county continue to decline in

settlers in the blackford county area living on the godfroy reserve after an  treaty the site is located in blackford countys harrison township east of montpelier although the godfroy reserve was allotted to miami indian chief francois aka francis godfroy delaware indians were also allowed to stay there the miami tribe was the most powerful group of indians in the region and francois godfroy who was half french was one of their chiefs by  godfroy had sold the reserve and the indians had migrated west benjamin reasoner was the first european–american to enter future blackford county and its first land owner he entered what would become licking township on july   reasoner and his sons built the countys first mill which was located on the family farm for a brief period the land that would become blackford county was the western part of jay county an act of the indiana general assembly which was approved january   created jay county effective after march   in december  a motion was made in the indiana house of representatives to review dividing jay county but that resolution was not adopted two blackford county communities matamoras and montpelier originally existed as part of jay county both of these communities are located along the salamonie river in what became the northeast portion of blackford county john blount founded matamoras arriving in note  this village is blackford countys oldest community and is the site of the countys largest water mill the mill constructed around  was considered one of the finest in the state blackford countys other former jay county community is montpelier which is located west of matamoras on the salamonie river led by abel baldwin the community was started in  by groups of migrant settlers from vermont the vermont natives named the settlement after the capital of their home state montpelier blackford countys montpelier was platted in  before matamoras and is the countys oldest platted community several sources claim blackford county was created in note  however the law was not finalized until  indiana bill of the house no  was originally for the creation of a county named windsor the name windsor was replaced with the name blackford by the house of representatives in january  an act for the formation of the county of blackford was approved on february   this act intended that the county would be open for business on the first monday in april  which was april  however the county was not organized finally on january   the original february  act was amended stating that blackford county shall enjoy the rights and privileges of an independent county the act also appointed commissioners and corrected a misprint that defined the southeast corner of the new countynote  over the next two years a political battle continued over the location of the county seat the tiny community of hartford was repeatedly selected by the commissioners but those decisions were challenged by individuals favoring montpelier while licking township location of community of hartford was the most populous township in the county the community of montpelier was the countys oldest platted community after a third and fourth act of the indiana general assembly hartford was finalized as the location of the county seat—and construction of a courthouse began because it was discovered that another community in indiana was also named hartford blackford countys hartford was eventually renamed hartford city during the next  years the county grew slowly plans were made for roads and railroads and swampland was drained the first railroad line was authorized in  the plan was for the fort wayne  southern railroad company to connect the indiana cities of fort wayne and muncie—running north–south through the blackford county communities of montpelier and hartford city although work constructing the railroad line began in the s it was not completed by connecting fort wayne to muncie until  and this delay caused it to be the second railroad to operate in blackford county by the time the railroad began operations it was named fort wayne cincinnati  louisville railroad the lake erie and western railroad acquired this railroad in note  the first railroad to operate in blackford county crossed somewhat east–west through the countys southern half the railroad was named union and logansport railroad company by the time it entered blackford county this line was proposed in  and completed to hartford city in —running through the blackford county communities of dunkirk crumleys crossing and hartford city the small community of crumleys crossing was renamed converse and two other communities millgrove and renner became established on this line the railroad was eventually named pittsburgh cincinnati and st louis railroad other names for the railroad since that time include the panhandle division of the pennsylvania railroad penn central railroad company conrail and norfolk southern railway a portion of this line is now abandoned and the track has been removed between converse and hartford city south of state road  gas boomedit see also indiana gas boom blackford county in  with western portion of jay county east of blackford and northeast corner of delaware county south of blackford in  natural gas was discovered in two counties adjacent to blackford county the discoveries were in the small community of eaton south of hartford city along railroad line in delaware county and in the city of portland in jay county east of hartford city and millgrove the hartford city gas  oil company was formed in early  and successfully drilled a natural gas well later in the year in montpelier the montpelier gas  oil mining company was organized in the spring of  while natural gas was found throughout blackford county crude oil was found mostly in the countys harrison township somewhat between montpelier and mollie blackford countys first successful oil well located just south of montpelier began producing during  montpelier was thought to be the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world oil was also found in parts of washington township including a well that was thought to be the most phenomenal well ever drilled in america by  blackford county had  natural gas companies these companies were headquartered in all four of the countys townships including the communities of hartford city montpelier roll dunkirk trenton priam post office and millgrove in june  only  people held manufacturing jobs in blackford county the indiana gas boom transformed the region as manufacturers moved to the area to utilize the natural gas and railroad system during  indiana state inspectors visited  manufacturing facilities in blackford county and these companies employed  people compare to  two decades earlier since these inspections were in hartford city and montpelier only additional manufacturing employees from the countys small communities such as millgroves glass factory could be added to the count of  the countys two largest employers were glass factories american window glass plant number  and sneath glass company hartford citys resources low cost energy two railroads and workforce were especially favored by glass factories and a  directory lists  of themnote  in addition to an economic transformation another byproduct of the gas boom was an upgrade of blackford countys appearance many of the countys landmark buildings were constructed during the gas boom including the current courthouse and surrounding buildings in hartford citys courthouse square historic district the citys waterworks was also built during that period additional buildings include the carnegie library and historic presbyterian church in montpelier many of the buildings in its downtown historic district were also constructed during the gas boom montpeliers historic baptist church and montpeliers carnegie library were constructed in the early s – near the end of the gas boom postgas boomedit hartford citys waterworks built in  montpeliers historic baptist church built during montpeliers oil boom the indiana gas boom gradually came to an end during the first decade of the th century the end of the gas boom meant less prosperity for the county the gas and oil workers left some of the manufacturers moved and the service industries were forced to close or cut back operations because of fewer customers adding to the countys problems machines made the labor–intensive method originally used for producing window glass obsolete causing many of the countys skilled glass workers at the large american window glass plant to lose their jobs by  the window glass plant of the countys former largest employer was closednote  according to the united states census blackford countys population peaked at  in  and it still has not returned to that zenith over  years later the end of the gas boom was especially difficult for the smaller communities in the county since the loss of a single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than it did for a town with many businesses in the case of millgrove the communitys major manufacturer a glass factory closed for other communities such as mollie the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a waste of time and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished improvements to the automobile and highways which coincided with the end of the gas boom may have also contributed to the decline of the countys smaller communities the automobile changed business and shopping patterns at the expense of the smalltown merchant small town residents began to drive to larger communities to purchase goods because of the wider selection the improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads and interurban lines causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic in blackford county passenger service on the lake erie and western railroad line owned by the nickel plate road by that time was discontinued in  and the last interurban train ran on january   although the natural gas and oil workers left the area after the gas and oil boom montpeliers population eventually stabilized—and hartford citys grew some of the manufacturers remained in the countys two largest cities because of a lack of better alternatives hartford citys sneath glass company a major employer continued operations until the s hartford city leaders attracted businesses such as overhead door  and m  to replace some of the companies that left the area overhead door was a major employer in hartford city for over  years a major setback for the community involving overhead door occurred during the s although it began in the s during the s overhead door moved its headquarters from hartford city to dallas texas its hartford city manufacturing plant continued to be a major employer until the s when overhead door cut back local operations the hartford city facility finally closed in note  the county lost another major hartford city employer in  when the key plastics plant closed as  people lost their jobs agriculture continues to be an important factor in the countys economy over  percent of blackford countys land is occupied by soybean or corn fields additional crops and livestock are also raised good returns in agriculture are not always reflected in the economy of nearby towns as industrial agriculture has reduced the number of workers it needs and family farms have declined many small towns in the corn belt such as the communities in blackford county continue to decline in

its first land owner he entered what would become licking township on july   reasoner and his sons built the countys first mill which was located on the family farm for a brief period the land that would become blackford county was the western part of jay county an act of the indiana general assembly which was approved january   created jay county effective after march   in december  a motion was made in the indiana house of representatives to review dividing jay county but that resolution was not adopted two blackford county communities matamoras and montpelier originally existed as part of jay county both of these communities are located along the salamonie river in what became the northeast portion of blackford county john blount founded matamoras arriving in note  this village is blackford countys oldest community and is the site of the countys largest water mill the mill constructed around  was considered one of the finest in the state blackford countys other former jay county community is montpelier which is located west of matamoras on the salamonie river led by abel baldwin the community was started in  by groups of migrant settlers from vermont the vermont natives named the settlement after the capital of their home state montpelier blackford countys montpelier was platted in  before matamoras and is the countys oldest platted community several sources claim blackford county was created in note  however the law was not finalized until  indiana bill of the house no  was originally for the creation of a county named windsor the name windsor was replaced with the name blackford by the house of representatives in january  an act for the formation of the county of blackford was approved on february   this act intended that the county would be open for business on the first monday in april  which was april  however the county was not organized finally on january   the original february  act was amended stating that blackford county shall enjoy the rights and privileges of an independent county the act also appointed commissioners and corrected a misprint that defined the southeast corner of the new countynote  over the next two years a political battle continued over the location of the county seat the tiny community of hartford was repeatedly selected by the commissioners but those decisions were challenged by individuals favoring montpelier while licking township location of community of hartford was the most populous township in the county the community of montpelier was the countys oldest platted community after a third and fourth act of the indiana general assembly hartford was finalized as the location of the county seat—and construction of a courthouse began because it was discovered that another community in indiana was also named hartford blackford countys hartford was eventually renamed hartford city during the next  years the county grew slowly plans were made for roads and railroads and swampland was drained the first railroad line was authorized in  the plan was for the fort wayne  southern railroad company to connect the indiana cities of fort wayne and muncie—running north–south through the blackford county communities of montpelier and hartford city although work constructing the railroad line began in the s it was not completed by connecting fort wayne to muncie until  and this delay caused it to be the second railroad to operate in blackford county by the time the railroad began operations it was named fort wayne cincinnati  louisville railroad the lake erie and western railroad acquired this railroad in note  the first railroad to operate in blackford county crossed somewhat east–west through the countys southern half the railroad was named union and logansport railroad company by the time it entered blackford county this line was proposed in  and completed to hartford city in —running through the blackford county communities of dunkirk crumleys crossing and hartford city the small community of crumleys crossing was renamed converse and two other communities millgrove and renner became established on this line the railroad was eventually named pittsburgh cincinnati and st louis railroad other names for the railroad since that time include the panhandle division of the pennsylvania railroad penn central railroad company conrail and norfolk southern railway a portion of this line is now abandoned and the track has been removed between converse and hartford city south of state road  gas boomedit see also indiana gas boom blackford county in  with western portion of jay county east of blackford and northeast corner of delaware county south of blackford in  natural gas was discovered in two counties adjacent to blackford county the discoveries were in the small community of eaton south of hartford city along railroad line in delaware county and in the city of portland in jay county east of hartford city and millgrove the hartford city gas  oil company was formed in early  and successfully drilled a natural gas well later in the year in montpelier the montpelier gas  oil mining company was organized in the spring of  while natural gas was found throughout blackford county crude oil was found mostly in the countys harrison township somewhat between montpelier and mollie blackford countys first successful oil well located just south of montpelier began producing during  montpelier was thought to be the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world oil was also found in parts of washington township including a well that was thought to be the most phenomenal well ever drilled in america by  blackford county had  natural gas companies these companies were headquartered in all four of the countys townships including the communities of hartford city montpelier roll dunkirk trenton priam post office and millgrove in june  only  people held manufacturing jobs in blackford county the indiana gas boom transformed the region as manufacturers moved to the area to utilize the natural gas and railroad system during  indiana state inspectors visited  manufacturing facilities in blackford county and these companies employed  people compare to  two decades earlier since these inspections were in hartford city and montpelier only additional manufacturing employees from the countys small communities such as millgroves glass factory could be added to the count of  the countys two largest employers were glass factories american window glass plant number  and sneath glass company hartford citys resources low cost energy two railroads and workforce were especially favored by glass factories and a  directory lists  of themnote  in addition to an economic transformation another byproduct of the gas boom was an upgrade of blackford countys appearance many of the countys landmark buildings were constructed during the gas boom including the current courthouse and surrounding buildings in hartford citys courthouse square historic district the citys waterworks was also built during that period additional buildings include the carnegie library and historic presbyterian church in montpelier many of the buildings in its downtown historic district were also constructed during the gas boom montpeliers historic baptist church and montpeliers carnegie library were constructed in the early s – near the end of the gas boom postgas boomedit hartford citys waterworks built in  montpeliers historic baptist church built during montpeliers oil boom the indiana gas boom gradually came to an end during the first decade of the th century the end of the gas boom meant less prosperity for the county the gas and oil workers left some of the manufacturers moved and the service industries were forced to close or cut back operations because of fewer customers adding to the countys problems machines made the labor–intensive method originally used for producing window glass obsolete causing many of the countys skilled glass workers at the large american window glass plant to lose their jobs by  the window glass plant of the countys former largest employer was closednote  according to the united states census blackford countys population peaked at  in  and it still has not returned to that zenith over  years later the end of the gas boom was especially difficult for the smaller communities in the county since the loss of a single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than it did for a town with many businesses in the case of millgrove the communitys major manufacturer a glass factory closed for other communities such as mollie the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a waste of time and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished improvements to the automobile and highways which coincided with the end of the gas boom may have also contributed to the decline of the countys smaller communities the automobile changed business and shopping patterns at the expense of the smalltown merchant small town residents began to drive to larger communities to purchase goods because of the wider selection the improved quality of automobiles and roads competed with passenger service on the railroads and interurban lines causing a decline in passenger traffic on the rails small towns associated with railroad stations suffered from the loss in traffic in blackford county passenger service on the lake erie and western railroad line owned by the nickel plate road by that time was discontinued in  and the last interurban train ran on january   although the natural gas and oil workers left the area after the gas and oil boom montpeliers population eventually stabilized—and hartford citys grew some of the manufacturers remained in the countys two largest cities because of a lack of better alternatives hartford citys sneath glass company a major employer continued operations until the s hartford city leaders attracted businesses such as overhead door  and m  to replace some of the companies that left the area overhead door was a major employer in hartford city for over  years a major setback for the community involving overhead door occurred during the s although it began in the s during the s overhead door moved its headquarters from hartford city to dallas texas its hartford city manufacturing plant continued to be a major employer until the s when overhead door cut back local operations the hartford city facility finally closed in note  the county lost another major hartford city employer in  when the key plastics plant closed as  people lost their jobs agriculture continues to be an important factor in the countys economy over  percent of blackford countys land is occupied by soybean or corn fields additional crops and livestock are also raised good returns in agriculture are not always reflected in the economy of nearby towns as industrial agriculture has reduced the number of workers it needs and family farms have declined many small towns in the corn belt such as the communities in blackford county continue to decline in
