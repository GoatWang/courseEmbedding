nov   globe newswire  verthermia inc has selected the merge eclinicalos data management platform from merge eclinical for its clinical trial exploring the potential of whole body hyperthermia as a standalone treatment for women with stage iii or iv ovarian cancer the us food and drug administration fda approved the companys application to conduct the study which began in january the trial is the companys first cancer therapy the fda has approved for clinical trial and it is in the safety phase of studying the treatment of latestage solidtumor cancers verthermia is actively recruiting patients as the initial study is expected to last approximately two years according to verthermias cmo and the heatt trials principal investigator dr james f lilja the eclinicalos platform is a perfect fit for the study which incorporates a range of data collection and monitoring processes data integrity is a top priority for a critical trial and we saw merge eclinical as an ideal partner in helping us complete phase i and beyond our goal is to make whole body hyperthermia a safe fourth modality of cancer treatments safe outcomes with data to measure them are the keys to our success dr lilja also noted the eclinicalos platforms unique design allowed the verthermia team to build and launch the study in just three weeks that kind of starttogolive time means we can bring potentially lifesaving treatment more quickly not only to study participants now but also to other severely ill patients in the future if were successful he said we are committed to improving the outcomes of stage iii and iv ovarian cancer patients and see partners like merge eclinical as critical to our success merge eclinical president zaher elassi said his company is honored to be a part of verthermias work our goal is for eclinicalos to be the standard clinical data management platform no matter a studys size phase complexity or location he said in talking with the verthermia research team it was clear they needed a fully integrated endtoend study management platform that was also sophisticated intuitive and cost effective they also needed a platform that could get the study up and running in weeks not months as well as one that didnt require steep upfront costs thats eclinicalos in a nutshell the study is designed to raise a patients core temperature to therapeutic range via the corehfc™ medical device maintaining that temperature detoxifying the blood and returning the patient to normal body temperature as proven by past studies a key advantage of regional and whole body hyperthermia is that it helps other forms of cancer treatment work better because heating cancer cells to temperatures above normal makes them easier to destroy using radiation and certain chemotherapy drugs to
