technology innovation internet of things and open source may  april   srinidhi murthy srinidhi murthyinternet of things is technological break through that affects our lives in ways unimaginable before it has a wide spectrum of application ranging from the micro to the macro from our daily essentials to nuclear reactors and much moregetting an iot product out in the market is an extremely task there are challenges involved are in design of hardware software cloud and analytic’s components however there are quiet a few common areas amongst all products the need for sensors to be connected via wired or wireless mediums to centralized severs data collection interpretation and analysis on the datathe challenges in each of the components can be overcome by using open source technologies we talk about a few of them belowopen hardware software and standardsusing tried and tested industrial grade components sensors development boards and commercial friendly open source software licenses for products saves a lot of over head in development of components and its sub sequence testing it also reduces the time to market of the products as the based hardware and software are already available and only custom changes specific to the product under development needs effortopen platforms like the raspberry pi arduino and beagle bone enable developers with limited hardware and lowlevel software expertise to develop applications in days rather than months if the correct platforms are chosen leveraging open source technologies that communicate with each other can significantly reduce the time and effort to get prototypes from paper to productionworking with multiple vendors and platforms doors are opened for new innovation such partnerships lays the foundation for a new generation of connected applications that can be developed independently from the devices on which they will runusage of such components in products changes the mindset of the the key stake holders in the industry and the reluctance to accept them as standards is overcomeecosystem and support communityonce an open source standards is released it is almost immediately adapted by evangelists that are ready to embrace new technology and explore them to the fullest this creates a very large ecosystem of variations of the standards that have been released and thus create a very large ecosystemsuch evangelists are also helpful in terms of support and can help in quicker resolution of issues faced during product development thus creating a more robust product and also reducing the time to market of the producttakeawayno one knows what the future is for iot but committing to a standards and open source platforms will help drive iot innovation and bring products to market faster standards will also ensure technology interop and open source platforms ensure that both hardware and software components can be reused as product platforms evolveread more iot adoption – ambitious growth with formidable technical challenge – how paasmer fits in may  may   chandramouli srinivasan a recent gartner survey provided key insights and recommendations on iot adoption we recently did an exercise to map these key findings and recommendations to our iot platform of a service – paasmer  we have highlighted the points significantly addressed by paasmer in block letters below paasmer – being a gatewaycloud centric architecture addresses the highlighted area in comprehensive manner by designas stated in paasmer press coverage on raconteur online – paasmer scores extremely high over other existing architectures by being most flexible and scalablegartner key findingsthe number of iot projects per organization is surprisingly high companies that have implemented iot have on average  different iot projects and the number of projects is expected to rise to  within three yearsheavy assetoriented industries are focused on internal benefits for example asset optimization and plan to implement about twice as many projects  versus  as companies in light serviceoriented industries which are more focused on external benefits for example new revenue sourcesfiftyone percent and  of survey respondents identified cybersecurity and integration respectively as their top two technical challenges for iot projectsmore than onethird  of respondents that have already implemented or are planning to implement iot are planning to use an iot platform for their next iot projectgartner recommendationscios and it leaders shouldtreat iot project proliferation as a call to action consider the role of iot in your company and build plans to leverage it by yearend  expect these “living plans” to evolve over timeincorporate iot into your enterprise architecture invest in integration middleware either for iotot integration with mes or other applications in heavy industries or for iotit integration with core enterprise applications such as erp in light industriesdevelop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy early in iot project planning to mitigate post deployment challengescompanies that do not yet plan or do not yet know whether they will use an iot platform for their iot project should learn more about the maturity and potential benefits of this middlewareread more key drivers of business intelligence  analytics market april   chandramouli srinivasan chandramouli srinivasanthe overall bi and analytics market segment continues to expand and is expected to sustain its  growth rate of  adjusted for constant currency through  — as reflected in gartner’s current estimate of the compound annual growth rate for the sector however this lower rate of growth reflects a market in transition with changing buying patterns and requirements purchasing decisions continue to move from it leaders to lineofbusiness executives and users who want more agility and more flexible personalized options — making the landandexpand model the new norm this is in stark contrast to the large enterprisescale deals that fueled doubledigit growth at a time when it had larger budgets and wielded much more influence in buying decisionsthe primary drivers of new growth in this rapidly evolving market are being influenced by the following dynamicsnew vendors continue to emerge offering innovative products to the market for buyers to consider during the next several years buyers will benefit from the attention that vendors are giving to the bi and analytics market and will have ample opportunity to invest in the innovative product offerings that are brought to market the downside of having a plethora of innovative products to pilot and vendors to engage in pocs with is the tendency for organizations to incur technical debt over time — as multiple standalone solutions that demonstrate business value quickly and hastily turn into production deployments without adequate attention being paid to design implementation and supportthe increased need for governance will serve as the catalyst for renewed it engagement as businessuserled deployments expand when the market shift first began business users felt empowered to circumvent it and autonomously purchase and begin using any product that addressed the gaps in their enterprise bi programmarket awareness and adoption of smart data discovery will extend data discovery to a wider range of users increasing the reach and impact of analytics these emerging capabilities facilitate discovery of hidden patterns in large complex and increasingly multistructured datasets without building models or writing algorithms or queriesthe need for organizations to integrate and derive insight from a growing number of multistructured data sources will drive innovation in smart selfservice data preparation and smart data discovery organizations will require sophisticated software capabilities that automate the ingestion inference enrichment and creation of search indexes when accessing new data sourcessearchbased data discovery enabled by naturallanguage query will extend the reach of analytics to more users as bi and analytics platforms increasingly support naturallanguage query allowing nontechnical users to analyze data by asking questions in a conversational way new users are more likely to engage with and leverage analyticsmarketplaces will expand and mature creating new opportunities for organizations to buy and sell analytic capabilities the availability of an active marketplace where buyers and sellers converge to exchange analytic applications aggregated data sources custom visualizations and algorithms is likely to generate increased interest in the bi and analytics space and to fuel its future growthorganizations will need to support realtime events and streaming data capture in support of iot use cases in order for organizations to prepare for the volume of data that is generated by devices sensors and people in a

functional testing tool is the latest addition to the software performance testing tool market unlike other tools in the market place which simply record and replay back traffic what makes jarload unique in the performance testing market is the reality that it tests using real web browsers just as users themselves would experience interacting on websites all current performance testing tools are not equipped to deal with new web technologies like ajax html  and javascript jarload is the only enterprise solution built from the ground up using real browsers and therefore handles these technologies with ease this explains why so many software test consultancy firms are approaching us continuously when recording and replaying back traffic as the majority of performance testing tools do if a website changes then these traditional tools will have to be rescripted in order to adapt with the changes all scripts will work with our solution no matter what adjustments have been made to the websites jarload is an ‘enterprise tool’ without an ‘enterprise price tag’ the tool has all the features to stand up to the main enterprise grade players in the market such as soasta loadrunnerneoload and silkperformer however jarload is priced a lot more competitively than these tools jarload also competes with open source tools including jmeter the biggest advantage we have over open sources tools is that jar load is extremely user friendly so that people with basic or no programming experience can use itthe greatly reduced engineering time results in performance engineers spending less time in testing and more time devoted to other critical tasksfast and responsive ux built around process driven testing allows tests to be created scaled and analyzed in timescales much quicker than the competition reduces the hidden costs of usage jarload is available on a number of different pricing models to suit the clients needs ondemand the user can pay for tests as and when they need daily and monthly rental we have both daily and monthly rental options available to provide flexibility to your testing requirements bulk purchase clients can bulk buy virtual users and draw

interested in technology that can treat children will life altering diseases more investors more investors details expand all whats new about what youre making how is it different we are only few of the companies offering edge centric iot platform architecture and our architecture defines a unique edge centric selfsufficient implementation model of building an iot solution the cloud part of the solution is offered toaccommodate flexible hybrid modelsthe key differentiation and unique aspects of our edgegateway centric architecture that is unique to paasmer compared to existing iot platforms are  best in class high speed edge database innovative edge analytics modular edge os innovative edge  cloud security  dynamic cloud management how big is the market data from our advisor gartner inc states that iot platform market is expected to touch usd  million in  and expected to double in  who are your competitors how are you different ayla networks  paasmer differs from ayla as a platform that is much more flexible to integrate efficient to help clients for a faster time to market ayla is more focused in enabling odms while paasmer is focused on  major verticals like connected home healthcare mm  retailmachineshop  paasmer differs from machineshop in giving the complete operating system bundled with all libraries for clients to easily integrate while machineshop gives only the libraries required hence the time to take to integrate an iot solution is lower in paasmer what do you understand about your business that others dont get iot platform comprises of two solution components mainly edge internal and cloud external most of the iot platform about  focuses on cloud part of the platform only most times our prospects are tempted to use cloud to build their iot solution however in the longer run the platform costs would spiral as the data grows on the cloud it is important that the most critical and complex edge part is designed in a efficient way to keep the platform costs nominal on the long run hence paasmers focus is to enable the edge to be more powerful by providing all the key components including analytics the edge this means paasmer makes sensors and gateway more powerful by enabling them with the power of fog computing whats your biggest risk what keeps you up at night every month new platforms are getting launched and most of the hyperscale cloud players like microsoft google amazon oracle etc have also launched their iot platforms it is important to clearly articulate the differentiation and demonstrate the value of the platform to our potential leads and clients this will offer a key differentiation both from technology and business standpoints how will you make money the revenue generation comes for the platform comes from three different streams professional  consultancy services to build the solution licensing fees on the gateway os  subscription fees on the cloud we expect the services component to be higher in the initial phases and then taper down as we engage more partners to enable our clients how do you acquire customers our strategy for acquiring customers are through referrals from our existing customer base social media marketing  lead generation and lead nurturing programs through social media campaigns marketing  tradeshows email campaign weekly newsletters to leads  sales  inbound  outbound sales process that involves calls meetings  demo do you already have clients are they doing internal or external projects yes we already have clients and we are revenue generating from our clients majority are building their products using paasmer technology to bring their products to market next year the first consumer iot product powered by paasmer is set to launch in us retail market in jan  how are you better than the competitors what we do is to offer a gateway based data intelligence that means the client does not have a need to go to a cloud based cloud analytics unless it is absolutely necessary what we do is make the sensors and gateways intelligent with our software so the client goes to cloud and analytics only if there is a need that can benefit them through cost of maintaining the solution from a long term perspective most of these components are offered as freemium to our clients at prototype stage and then they start paying us for services subscription and license once they go to production this model is unique compared to our competitors who are offering only parts of the solution like cloud freemium and not build the entire solution stack as freemium what have your biggest challenges been so far funding is a big challenge for us because there is a bunch of roadmap items that we have and we need to fund the investment in terms of development on our roadmap our number two problem revolves around our sales and marketing this is something we need to build up aggressively to go after the market what are you trying to do with the funds what kind of mile stones are you trying to hit over the next year or two there are three things we are trying to use these funds for number one is to build on our product development which is a late entry product development in terms of enabling roadmap items on the product development side the second is to build a sales and marketing team that can aggressively focus and drive and get solutions out to the market the third is to partner with a builder we actually want to have quite a lot of hardware and software partners so that when a client comes with a particular requirement we can position our own it to our partners it could you tell us more about the team why youre the ones to make this all happen right now we have two cofounders one is myself chandramouli ive been in hp and intel over the past  years the other is kavitha whos also an exintel employee with  years of experience weve been working on the software part of the solution for the past two years we have quite a bit of track record in terms of building products both hardware and software side when we started out in building this platform we were focused on enabling the software and we want to bring some of the people that weve been working with as our hardware partners to date we have intel mediatek we have qualcomm who are all signed up as our gateway partners we have a couple of sensor partners that we have also signed up this is again based on our intel experience and we have a bunch of oemodms based in china and taiwan who are also on board in terms of designing hardware centric parts for our clients of which our software can be bundled along and implemented for that what are you worried about right now and in the future the speed in which the iot is actually transforming and the awareness of the iot among the businesses is a challenge implementing an iot solution with the businesses is one thing that has been growing at an exponential rate which means people want to have iot and actually want to solve their business problems using iot the pace at which many of the competitors are moving is also one of the key things that keeps me awake at night and many of the people are understanding that this is becoming the next revolution to internet is jumping on this opportunity amazon google and microsoft launched their iot platform this year and when we started out in  none of them were there and the pace at which these guys are trying to capitalize on this opportunity is something that keeps me awake and it takes a lot of funds and aggression in this market to capture it whats your exit strategy what kind of roi can be expected ma is one of our top exit strategy over a period of  years as our platform could be a complementary addition to an existing portfolio of a larger iot cloud provider some of our competitors with equivalent platform architectures are either having a larger iot player as strategic investor cisco is an investor in ayla or acquired by a larger player solair acquired by microsoft roi can be expected to take a period until an exit happens typical return rates tend to be higher in iot space than other in technology space as iot is in

technological break through that affects our lives in ways unimaginable before it has a wide spectrum of application ranging from the micro to the macro from our daily essentials to nuclear reactors and much moregetting an iot product out in the market is an extremely task there are challenges involved are in design of hardware software cloud and analytic’s components however there are quiet a few common areas amongst all products the need for sensors to be connected via wired or wireless mediums to centralized severs data collection interpretation and analysis on the datathe challenges in each of the components can be overcome by using open source technologies we talk about a few of them belowopen hardware software and standardsusing tried and tested industrial grade components sensors development boards and commercial friendly open source software licenses for products saves a lot of over head in development of components and its sub sequence testing it also reduces the time to market of the products as the based hardware and software are already available and only custom changes specific to the product under development needs effortopen platforms like the raspberry pi arduino and beagle bone enable developers with limited hardware and lowlevel software expertise to develop applications in days rather than months if the correct platforms are chosen leveraging open source technologies that communicate with each other can significantly reduce the time and effort to get prototypes from paper to productionworking with multiple vendors and platforms doors are opened for new innovation such partnerships lays the foundation for a new generation of connected applications that can be developed independently from the devices on which they will runusage of such components in products changes the mindset of the the key stake holders in the industry and the reluctance to accept them as standards is overcomeecosystem and support communityonce an open source standards is released it is almost immediately adapted by evangelists that are ready to embrace new technology and explore them to the fullest this creates a very large ecosystem of variations of the standards that have been released and thus create a very large ecosystemsuch evangelists are also helpful in terms of support and can help in quicker resolution of issues faced during product development thus creating a more robust product and also reducing the time to market of the producttakeawayno one knows what the future is for iot but committing to a standards and open source platforms will help drive iot innovation and bring products to market faster standards will also ensure technology interop and open source platforms ensure that both hardware and software components can be reused as product platforms evolveread more iot adoption – ambitious growth with formidable technical challenge – how paasmer fits in may  may   chandramouli srinivasan a recent gartner survey provided key insights and recommendations on iot adoption we recently did an exercise to map these key findings and recommendations to our iot platform of a service – paasmer  we have highlighted the points significantly addressed by paasmer in block letters below paasmer – being a gatewaycloud centric architecture addresses the highlighted area in comprehensive manner by designas stated in paasmer press coverage on raconteur online – paasmer scores extremely high over other existing architectures by being most flexible and scalablegartner key findingsthe number of iot projects per organization is surprisingly high companies that have implemented iot have on average  different iot projects and the number of projects is expected to rise to  within three yearsheavy assetoriented industries are focused on internal benefits for example asset optimization and plan to implement about twice as many projects  versus  as companies in light serviceoriented industries which are more focused on external benefits for example new revenue sourcesfiftyone percent and  of survey respondents identified cybersecurity and integration respectively as their top two technical challenges for iot projectsmore than onethird  of respondents that have already implemented or are planning to implement iot are planning to use an iot platform for their next iot projectgartner recommendationscios and it leaders shouldtreat iot project proliferation as a call to action consider the role of iot in your company and build plans to leverage it by yearend  expect these “living plans” to evolve over timeincorporate iot into your enterprise architecture invest in integration middleware either for iotot integration with mes or other applications in heavy industries or for iotit integration with core enterprise applications such as erp in light industriesdevelop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy early in iot project planning to mitigate post deployment challengescompanies that do not yet plan or do not yet know whether they will use an iot platform for their iot project should learn more about the maturity and potential benefits of this middlewareread more key drivers of business

to the market for buyers to consider during the next several years buyers will benefit from the attention that vendors are giving to the bi and analytics market and will have ample opportunity to invest in the innovative product offerings that are brought to market the downside of having a plethora of innovative products to pilot and vendors to engage in pocs with is the tendency for organizations to incur technical debt over time — as multiple standalone solutions that demonstrate business value quickly and hastily turn into production deployments without adequate attention being
