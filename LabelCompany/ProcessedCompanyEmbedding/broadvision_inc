fraud class action on behalf of persons who purchased broadvision inc broadvision or the company common stock between  and  the class period against broadvision and its top officers for violations of the federal securities laws arising out of defendants dissemination of false and misleading statements concerning the companys thq  financial results the release of its new product its business and its prospects for  and beyond  broadvision develops markets and supports application software solutions designed for onetoone relationship management across extended enterprises these solutions are intended to enable businesses to use the internet as a platform to conduct electronic commerce provide online customer selfservice deliver targeted information to constituents and provide online financial services by late  broadvisions stock price had declined significantly due to reduced demand for its products and slowing sales by the time broadvision reported its results for the thq  on  broadvisions ceo and cfo were aware that the company was suffering from a horrendous combination of declining demand and out of control expenses they also knew broadvisions new version of its onetoone enterprise product version  due to be released in the stq  did not meet jee standards which would reduce demand for this new product and further impact broadvisions future results defendants knew these conditions would severely impair broadvisions future revenue growth and impair their ability to make future stock sales and extract future bonuses which were tied to the companys performance thus defendants continued to make positive but false statements about broadvisions business and future revenues when reporting broadvisions thq  results as a result broadvisions stock traded as high as  during the class period  then on  after the close of market broadvision announced its preliminary stq  results the revision of its previously reported thq  results and a onetime charge in the ndq  broadvision inc a leading provider of personalized ebusiness applications today announced that based on preliminary estimates it expects revenue for the quarter ended march   will be between  million and  million and basic proforma loss per share pending review of nonrecurring items will be in the range of  to  the company believes these results were adversely affected by uncertainties surrounding the current economic and it spending environments which caused customers to delay purchases of the companys products as a result of these uncertainties the company announced it will implement a number of initiatives to substantially reduce its operating expenses including a corporatewide reorganization and related workforce reduction of approximately  people or  of the companys workforce based on these actions the company anticipates that it will record a onetime charge in the second quarter an estimate of this charge will be disclosed when the company reports its first quarter earnings on april th  the company also announced it has revised its previously released unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter ended december   to include approximately  million of additional expenses these additional expenses were identified by the company subsequent to the press release issued on january   and were promptly brought to the attention of the companys independent auditors these expenses reduced reported fourth quarter diluted proforma earnings per share to  from  and full fiscal year  proforma earnings per share to  from  on a fully diluted basis  this disclosure shocked the market causing broadvisions stock to decline to  per share before closing at  on  inflicting hundreds of millions of dollars of damage on plaintiff and the class broadvisions cfo did not fair nearly

 usc §§jb and ta and rule b jurisdiction is conferred by § of the  act  usc §aa  venue is proper here pursuant to § of the  act broadvision is located in redwood city california and the acts and

redwood city california broadvisions stock is traded in an efficient market on the nasdaq national market system  a defendant pehong chen chen was during the class period chairman of the board chief executive officer and president of the company b defendant randall c bolten bolten was during the class period chief financial officer and executive vicepresident operations of the company during the class period bolten sold  shares of his broadvision stock for proceeds of   the parties listed in ¶ab are referred to as the individual defendants they are liable for the false statements pleaded herein at ¶ as those statements were each grouppublished information for which they were collectively responsible the individual defendants by reason of their stock ownership and positions with broadvision were controlling persons of broadvision broadvision controlled each of the individual defendants these controlling persons are liable under §a of the  act scienter and scheme allegations  the individual defendants are broadvisions top executives they ran broadvision as handson managers dealing with important issues facing broadvisions business ie its rising expenses its new products including onetoone enterprise version  broadvisions market share position and its ability to report earnings in  in light of the dramatic adverse developments which had been affecting broadvisions business since late   broadvision was founded in  and went public in june  the stock did not trade above  per share until late  and early  when the stock price increased dramatically to approximately  per share in connection with the markets appetite for internetrelated companies in midapril  the nasdaq suffered a significant decline and broadvisions stock declined as well by late  broadvisions growth had slowed and its stock price declined even further  by the time broadvision reported its results for the thq  on  broadvisions ceo and cfo were aware that the company was suffering from a horrendous combination of declining demand and out of control expenses they also knew broadvisions new version of its onetoone enterprise product version  due to be released in the stq  did not meet jee standards which would reduce demand for this new product and further impact broadvisions future results defendants knew these conditions would severely impair broadvisions future revenue growth and impair their ability to make future stock sales and extract future bonuses which were tied to the companys performance  broadvisions most important new product in early  was version  which was to be generally available in the stq  and the individual defendants closely monitored its progress and the specifications it met this new product was important to broadvision because its competitor vignette already had a version that was compatible with the latest version of sun microsystems java programming language known as jee a new language that was already familiar to some  million developers and is popular because it works seamlessly with other software  also at the time broadvision reported its thq  results defendants were aware that expenses were much higher than the market had been led to expect as a result the individual defendants particularly bolten closely scrutinized operating expenses nonetheless in order to avoid having broadvisions thq  results be a complete disaster defendants deliberately disregarded more than  million in additional expenses which should have been recorded in the thq   each of the defendants was personally familiar with broadvisions stq  revenues as they monitored broadvisions sales closely monitoring the performance of broadvisions operations via reports from broadvisions finance and sales departments which were generated and provided to management on a weekly basis the reports summarized orders dollar volume and product type as a result of the individual defendants monitoring each of the individual defendants was aware that broadvision would be unable to meet its projected results as its large customers were cutting back on or delaying purchases however because the appearance of future earnings growth was so critical to defendants plan to inflate the price of broadvision shares defendants concealed the adverse factors then affecting its business false and misleading statements during the class period  on  after the markets closed broadvision reported its thq  and  results in a release which stated in part   quarter  ended q quarter ended q revenues m  m  operating income pro formafiscal  only  m   m

quarter of profitability on a proforma basis our aggressive growth and enhanced presence in global markets did result in higher than anticipated expense levels in q but we feel good about the market and believe that we are well positioned for continued success said dr pehong chen president and ceo broadvision    this past quarter  leading firms joined broadvisions expanding network of systems integration consulting and reseller partners to expand its distribution channels broaden product integration and develop and launch new technology and services to further penetrate markets in leading industries worldwide highlights this quarter include    o a strategic alliance with bea systems to embed bea weblogic server� within broadvision onetoone enterprise broadvisions ebusiness application platform the announcement of this strategic alliance was included in broadvisions introduction of the next generation of broadvisions ebusiness application platform broadvision onetoone enterprise the partnership with bea systems will add java�  platform enterprise edition jee� support to broadvision onetoone enterprise version  these new java technologybased features will enhance broadvisions already robust support for open standards including javascript� technology c com corba xml xsl ldap wml and wap broadvision onetoone enterprise version  will be one of the only jee technologycompatible ebusiness solution suites to also deliver comprehensive ebusiness applications content management personalization analytics and wireless support from a single vendor  on  at  pm eastern time broadvision hosted a conference for analysts media representatives and large broadvision investors in which chen and bolten made statements and answered questions during the call chen and bolten represented that o although broadvision had experienced higher expenses in the thq  it expected expenses to remain flat in the stq  such that this was not a trend o the companys management was comfortable with analysts estimates for revenues of  million in the stq  and  million in  o the higher than expected expenses were more an operational issue and did not impact broadvisions growth drivers as demand and revenue growth continued to be strong o revenue in the stq  would be fueled by the general availability of the broadvisionbea systems jeecompliant onetoone enterprise version  o management was seeing continued strong demand for broadvisions infoexchange portal and marketmaker products o average selling price asp of broadvisions products continued to increase to  in the thq  and was increasing in the stq  as well o broadvision had the strongest partner relationships in the industry with entrenched positions with the big  channel systems integrators o some of the increase in expenses in the thq  was research and development costs associated with the rollout of version  o broadvision continued to be on track to report eps of  and  in the stq  and  respectively  analysts

sales representatives with three to six months of experience that could in our estimation add another  million in license software to our current estimate of  million in q o legg mason revenue results were healthy with strong generation from marquee customers and a rejuvenated product pipeline the product pipeline in particular appears quite healthy the company continues to indicate that market health is based on large deals to fortune  customers systems integration work appears to be flowing back to the big  potentially away from the web integrators we believe both of those points cater to broadvisions strengths within the industry o usbancorp piper we believe that customers and channel partners are asking for flexible extensible and scalable solutions based on open architectures including java and that in response broadvision has laid the road map for a java migration by the end of the march quarter  we believe that broadvision will have in general availability a javaenabled solution we also believe that by the first half of  broadvision will transition to a full javabased architecture we believe that migrating to java will provide both a more flexible and extensible solution for broadvisions customers and increased channel support from systems integrators and consultants having stated the benefits of this transition we do have an elevated awareness of the inherent execution risks associated with this migration we reiterate our buy rating o jefferies  co while architecture issues may become an issue with future developments bvsns move to the jee standard scheduled for release at the end of march should resolve any nearterm concerns about integration particularly as its weblogiccompatible version becomes available at the same time between these two developments bvsn has effectively resolved the main criticisms of its core technology  that it is hard to integrate and doesnt scale very well  through its partnerships with bea systems and webmethods what has not been evident however is bvsns very strong position in a space that is widely seen to be a critical technology to enable ebusiness the buy vs build criticism strikes us as a significant advantage as the market migrates toward mass adopters o moors cabot with respect to bea systems the two companies still need to work out a royalty payment that is feasible to both parties but we understand an agreement is imminent bea will integrate its weblogic application server into broadvisions v application platform offering broadvisions customers java functionality and jee compliance as for version  management assured us that the company is on track to deliver the product by the end of this quarter o friedman billings ramsey  co the most significant new product and potentially company defining will be the upcoming release of version  this release will embed beas weblogic server and provide the java support that bvsn has been lacking the few beta customers have experienced no difficulties migrating from previous releases according to management o deutsche banc alex brown  management stood firm with its  revenue guidance in spite of only beating q guidance by
