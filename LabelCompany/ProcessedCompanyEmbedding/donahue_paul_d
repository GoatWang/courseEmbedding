history certainly indicative of the managements stability within our organization i will continue to serve as chairman of the board and as such i will remain active around gpc but going forward paul and carol will be doing all of the work on these quarterly calls and i just couldnt feel any better or more positive about the future of our company with paul as our president chief executive officer and carol as executive vice president and chief financial officer leading the way these are two very talented and capable executives and they are highly regarded both inside our organization and externally as well and they will do a fine job in leading our company and creating shareholder value in the years ahead with that said i want to thank each of you on the call for your past and ongoing support of genuine parts company and ill turn the call over to paul paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thank you tom i appreciate the kind remarks and the ongoing support im both honored and humbled to follow you as ceo of this great company youve had an admirable year career at gpc and the performance of the company under your leadership for the last  years has been impressive that said working closely with you for the last nine years has been invaluable and i feel well prepared for this new role and importantly the compensation of our management team remains in place to build upon our performance so thank you and i look forward to working with you in your role as the chairman gpc has a long and rich year history of steady consistent growth and sound financial and has been an effective steward of capital under my leadership we intend to build on these achievements over the many years to come in my first  days as ceo ive taken considerable time to visit with our operations both around the globe and across our business segment and im more encouraged than ever about the good work being done and the growth opportunities available in each of our businesses as this quarter would indicate we have our share of challenges to overcome but i also believe we can reinvigorate our sales growth in the coming quarters this is our most critical nearterm objective and im committed to making this happen we will provide more details later on the call to this point now turning to our second quarter ill make a few remarks on our overall result and then cover our performance by business carol yancey our executive vice president and chief financial officer will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for the full year after that well open the call to your questions a quick recap of our second quarter results shows sales for the quarter were  billion which was down  net income was  million down  and earnings per share were  in line with the second quarter of last year total sales in the quarter included a  benefit from acquisitions spread across our automotive industrial and office businesses and youll hear more on our acquisition activity as we review our business results currency exchange was still a headwind to our overall results with the strength of the us dollar versus the canadian australian new zealand and mexican currencies impacting our results by approximately  on the revenue line and  per share in eps turning to our automotive operations for the quarter ended june  our global automotive sales were down  and included approximate  benefit from acquisitions offset by currency headwind of approximately  our us results were down  in the quarter which compares to a  increase in the first quarter and primarily due to the softness in demand associated with the mild winter and early spring while we are not pleased with this deceleration we would point out that our second quarter sales in  the last year we had similar mild winter patterns we were also down  basis points from the first quarter so we have seen this pattern before and would expect to see a more normalized growth within the next few quarters as the impact of weather plays out and we execute on our growth initiatives our us results varies widely by geographical region with our better performing markets in the western southern and mountain regions of the country the central eastern and southwest regions of the country all underperformed again we would attribute the soft results in the central and eastern regions till the mild winter temperatures and this is evident in the failed transfer of weatherrelated goods such as batteries heating and cooling and ride control products which were weak through most of the second quarter we are pleased to report however that our batteries and air conditioning sales recovered significantly with the hot june temperatures with both up doubledigits in the southwest we remain challenged by the ongoing negative impact of the oil and gas sector on fleet and general installer  business samestore sales for our us companyowned store group were flat in the second quarter and this compares to a  increase in the first quarter the cadence of the quarter saw our team post a low singledigit increase in april likely bolstered by the shift in the timing of easter followed by a low to mid singledigit decline in may and flat results in june so a mixed cadence with the month of may being our most challenging month taking a deeper look into our samestore sales for the quarter our commercial wholesale side of the business slightly outperformed the retail diy business driving the overall flat samestore sales results despite the ongoing diy initiatives across our companyowned store group fairly weak market conditions resulted in a slight sales decrease for our companyowned retail sales we believe however that the current market conditions will prove to be shortlived and we remain confident in the longterm positive benefits of our retail initiatives as a reminder these broad initiatives include installing new interior layouts and graphics extended store hours increased training for our store associates and the nationwide launch of our napa rewards program to name just a few furthermore we continue to expand on our retail impact initiative which was initially piloted at  stores in  with plans to implement this concept in  companyowned stores in  we are encouraged by the positive impact of these initiatives at our updated stores with early results exceeding our expectations on both the retail and commercial sides of the business for the second quarter our retail transaction counts were down low singledigit while our average basket size was up low singledigit moving along to our core commercial wholesale business this segment of our automotive business was basically flat in the second quarter which compares to a  increase in the first quarter the core drivers for our commercial wholesale business continue to center  around our major accounts business and our napa autocare centers and the results for these key customer groups are good measures for the weak market conditions we encountered this quarter on the major accounts front sales were down low singledigits which we believe reflects the challenging sales environment these customers are seeing sales to our autocare centers were up lowsingle digits driven by the ongoing increase in memberships now totaling over  members strong as an additional point of reference our fleet business was off slightly for the quarter our average wholesale ticket value was down slightly with no benefit from inflation and we are flat in the average number of tickets turning now to our import parts business in the us we continue to be encouraged by the strong underlying growth for this business and with the added benefit of olympus import parts a  million business acquired this past february we have positive momentum in this category as we enter in the second half of the year we continue to make solid progress with the integration of the olympus business and we are excited about the growth prospects for our import parts business overall given the positive attributes of this product offering we closed on another import parts acquisition in canada on july  which well cover a little bit later in the call also on the acquisition front we are pleased to report that we closed on an atlantabased heavyduty truck parts business on may  global parts operates six branches in three states and with the expected annual revenues of approximately  million it serves as a nice complement to our growing business in the heavyduty segment of the us automotive aftermarket moving on to the trends we are seeing across the us automotive aftermarket the fundamental drivers of our business continue to be positive the average age of fleet remains in excess of  years the size of the fleet continues to grow lower fuel prices remain favorable for the consumer and miles driven continues to post substantial gain after strong growth of  in  miles driven increased  in april the most recent data available and is up  yeartodate april marks th consecutive month of increases in miles driven with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric the national average price of gasoline was  in the second quarter well below last year and a positive indicator for further increases in miles driven and ultimately driving additional parts purchases before closing out our automotive review we want to update you on our international businesses which includes canada mexico australia and new zealand in australia and new zealand our core automotive business is performing well and we have made significant progress with the integration of the covs acquisition and its  branches in western australia likewise we are excited by the june  acquisition of amx a melbournebased retailer of aftermarket motorcycle accessories and parts with four stores and approximate annual revenues of  million our team in australia has a multiyear growth plan for this business which further expands our growing product offering in the motorcycle category with these acquisitions our footprint in australia and new zealand has now grown to  locations resulting in net new store growth of nearly  locations over the past three years at napa canada we continue to produce low to mid singledigit sales growth despite the ongoing economic challenges associated with the oil and gas slowdown impacting western canada and of course the devastating wildfires in fort mcmurray alberta back in may on july  we closed on the acquisition of autocamping a leading distributor of original equipment import parts in canada autocamping with  locations across canada specializes in original equipment automotive parts for the european vehicles and they sell to foreign repair specialists as well as original equipment dealers this business should generate approximately  million in annual revenues and much like the olympus acquisition in the us complements our existing product offering and distribution capabilities for import parts in canada finally in mexico our sales growth continued to gain momentum as we expand our napa footprint we have  napa stores in mexico today and have plans for additional store growth in the future we are encouraged by the longterm growth prospects we see for napa in mexico so in summary the second quarter proved challenging for our us automotive business although this was partially offset by the ongoing strength of our international operation we believe the weakness in our us sales relates to the impact of mild winter and early spring and we expect to improve on this quarters performance as we move ahead our plans call for expanding our business with our key commercial platforms napa autocare and major accounts executing our retail strategy and driving global expansion via new store openings as well as targeted strategic acquisitions lets turn now to our industrial business motion industries ended the quarter down approximately  which compares to a  increase in the first quarter after adjusting for acquisitions and currency core industrial sales were down an approximate  basically unchanged from their adjusted sales decrease in the first quarter so for the second quarter overall our industrial business seems to have stabilized which is consistent with the industrial indicators we tend to follow such as the industrial production and capacity utilization with that said a quick review of our business by industry segment by top customers and by top product category shows that the markets remain uneven and choppy among our top  industry segments three generated sales increases seven were down and two were essentially flat looking at our top  customers  of them increased sales while five were down consistent with what we saw in the first quarter and among our top  product categories we saw six that increased and six that were down also consistent with the first quarter so the takeaway here is that our results were quite mixed among our customers and product lines with solid results in a number of areas being offset by weaker results and others we have been operating in this type of difficult and choppy environment since the first quarter of  and as mentioned before believe we are seeing at least some early signs of a stabilized and industrial economy this would certainly bode well for a stronger cycle ahead shifting to the third quarter and the balance of the year we will be executing on our initiatives to grow market share and further expand our distribution footprint to generate sales growth we remain active with strategic bolton acquisitions for this business and expect to close on a few of these over the balance of the year we can tell you that effective august  we will close on atco  a regional industrial safety product distributor with estimated revenues of approximately  million moving on now to our electrical business eis sales for this group were down  and remaining challenged by many of the same factors that impacted our industrial business things such as the ongoing challenges for customers in the oil and gas segment lower defense spending lower copper pricing again in the quarter which cost us  of sales growth the impact of the stronger dollar on our exportoriented customers and just the overall sluggish economic climate were expecting to see these factors carry over to some degree for the balance of the year but its interesting to look at the individual performance of the three segments that comprised eis the electrical segment is our largest representing  of this groups revenues and sales were down low doubledigits fabrication was down low singledigits and our wiring and cable business was up low singledigits with each representing another  of the eis business but certainly there is room for improvement across the eis segment and our greatest sales challenges are primarily concentrated in the electrical portion of the business looking ahead our team is executing on its initiative to drive meaningful sales growth over the longterm and finally a few comments on the office products business which reported a  increase in sales for the second quarter which was driven by a  contribution from acquisitions sales for the safety zone acquired on june  represents the majority of our acquisition revenues for the office business and we are pleased to report that the integration of this business is progressing very well by customer group our mid singledigit growth in the mega channel was partially offset by a mid singledigit decline with our independent resellers on the products side the facilities and breakroom supplies category or fbs performed very well in the quarter while the office products segment category was down low singledigits furniture was down mid singledigits and technology products were down low doubledigits we continue to make solid progress on our acquisition strategy and the overall diversification of this business with a heavy emphasis on the growing fbs category as previously announced we acquired certain janitorial and sanitation business from rochester midland corporation effective july  we expect this business to further enhance our fbs product offering and contribute approximately  million in annual revenues our office team will continue to look for these types of strategic bolton acquisitions as well as execute on our ongoing share of wallet and market share initiatives to grow this business despite the challenging end market conditions that persist in this industry we are confident in our growth strategy and look forward to showing more progress over the balance of the year so that is an overview of our performance by business and we want to thank our teams across all of our businesses for their efforts dayin and dayout we appreciate all that they do to make gpc the great company that it is so at this point id also want to come back to my earlier comment that reinvigorating our sales growth is our number one priority during this call we talked a great deal about our sales environment and the execution of our initiatives to drive sales growth and i thought it might be helpful to pull it all together and outline a few of the key action steps we are taking to achieve this goal the four building blocks of our growth strategy are comprised of the following the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive a greater share of wallet with our existing customer base an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused both on geographical as well as product line expansion the building out of our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses and the further expansion of our us and international store footprint we are confident that our intense focus in these four key areas will positively impact our sales and support the steady and consistent growth we strive to achieve at genuine parts company now ill hand it over to carol who will provide a financial update and a full year guidance carol carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you paul and congratulations on your promotion to ceo it is certainly well deserved and we look forward to the execution of your key sales strategies and tom i would also like to thank you for your tremendous leadership of the company and on a more personal level your guidance and counsel over the years we will begin this morning with a review of our financials and look at the second quarter income statement and segment information and then well finish up with a review of a few key balance sheet items our total revenues of  billion for the second quarter were down  our gross profit for the second quarter was  which was equal to the prior year our management teams are focused on the effective execution of our gross margin initiatives and we remain committed to an enhanced gross margin for the long term the pricing environment across our businesses remains relatively steady with very little supplier inflation if any our cumulative supplier price changes through six months in  were automotive down  industrial up  office up  and electrical down  turning to our sga our total expenses for the second quarter were  million or  of sales which is up slightly from last year primarily due to this lower sales levels for the quarter this was partially offset by our tight cost control measures which continue to positively impact our results and drive our progress towards greater operational efficiencies now if we look at the results by segment our automotive revenue for the second quarter of  billion was down  from the prior year and  of total sales our operating profit of  million is down  and the operating margin for this group is  compared to  in the second quarter last year our industrial sales of  billion in the quarter were a decrease of  and  of our total revenues our operating profit of  million is down  and our operating margin is up  basis points to  which is driven by a nice gross margin improvement  office products revenues were  million in the second quarter up  and  of our total revenues our operating profit of  million is down  and our operating margin is  compared to  last year for the electrical group our sales were  million in the quarter down  in the prior year and also  of our total revenue operating profit of  million is down  and the margin for this group is  compared to  last year or down  basis points so for the second quarter our total operating profit margin was  compared to  in the second quarter last year this basically reflects the lack of leverage as mentioned earlier with that said we are intensely focused on showing progress in this area in the periods ahead we had net interest expense of  million in the quarter and for the full year we currently expect net interest of  million to  million our total amortization expense of  million for the second quarter and we would expect our total amortization expense for the full year to be  million to  million our depreciation expense was  million for the quarter and for the full year we project total depreciation to approximate  million to  million so our combined depreciation and amortization was  million for the second quarter and we would expect the combined number to be in the range of  million to  million for the full year the other line which primarily reflects our corporate expense was  million for the quarter compared to  million last year for the full year we still expect corporate expense to be in the  million to  million range our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately  compared to  in the second quarter last year the reduction in the rate is due to a higher mix of foreign earnings as well as a favorable nontaxable retirement plan valuation adjustment compared to last year we expect this rate to show a slight increase in the last half of the year but we are projecting our full year rate to be  to  our net income for the quarter as paul mentioned was  million compared to  million last year and our eps of  was equal to last year now turning to the balance sheet we continue to further strengthen our balance sheet with effective working capital management and strong cash flows our cash at june  was  million up slightly from june of last year our cash position continues to support the growth initiatives across all of our businesses accounts receivable of  billion at june  was up  from the prior year and we continue to closely manage our receivables and remain satisfied with our quality at this time our inventory at the end of the quarter was  billion which is actually down  when you exclude the impact of our acquisitions in the last  months our team continues to effectively manage our inventory levels and will continue to maintain this key investment at the appropriate levels as we move forward our accounts payable at june  was  billion up  from last year due to improved payment terms and other payables initiatives established with our vendors were encouraged by the positive impact of accounts payable on our working capital and also our days in payables and we would add that our ap to inventory ratio at june  reached  for the first time our working capital of  billion at june  continues to show steady improvement from quarter to quarter and is down nicely from the prior year effectively managing our working capital and in particular key items such as accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable remain a high priority for our company our total debt is  million at june  compares to  million in total debt last year and this includes two  million term notes as well as another  million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit we would also add that one of our term notes is due november  of this year and we currently intend to renew it upon the due date our total debt to capitalization is approximately  and were comfortable with our capital structure at this time we believe that it provides the company with both the flexibility and financial capacity necessary to take advantage of the growth opportunities that we may want to pursue so in summary our balance sheet is in excellent condition and remains a key strength of our company we continue to generate strong cash flows and following a record year in  we remain wellpositioned for another solid year in  we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the  million to  billion range for the full year and our free cash flow which deducts capital expenditures and dividends to be in the  million to  million range we remain committed to several ongoing priorities for the use of our cash which we believe serve to maximize shareholder value our priorities for cash includes strategic acquisitions share repurchases reinvestment in our businesses and the dividend our strategic acquisitions remained an ongoing and important use of cash for us and theyre integral to our growth plans through july  of this year weve added a number of new businesses across our automotive industrial and office operations these are excellent strategic fit for us and collectively we expect these acquisitions to generate approximately  million in annual revenues looking forward we will continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities across all of our distribution businesses to further enhance our prospects for future growth well continue to target those bolton acquisitions of companies with annual revenues in the  million to  million range but were also openminded to new complementary distribution businesses of all sizes large or small assuming the appropriate returns on investments turning to share repurchases we purchased  shares in the second quarter and  million shares for the six months todate we have  million shares authorized and available for repurchase while we have no set pattern for these repurchases we expect to remain active in the program and the periods ahead and we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders our investment in capital expenditures was  million in the second quarter and is  million through june for the year were currently planning for capital expenditures to be in the range of  million to  million so we expect capex to increase slightly over the balance of the year due to the timing of several large projects turning to our dividend our  dividend is  per share or a  increase in the prior year dividend of   also marked our th consecutive annual increase in the dividend so that concludes our financial update for the second quarter  and in summary our nonautomotive businesses continue to operate in a challenging sales environment and in the second quarter our us automotive sales were impacted by rather weak conditions fortunately we see these as transitory issues and we look forward to improving conditions as we move ahead additionally we continue to benefit from strong performances in our international automotive operations for the quarter we offset some of the market headwinds with key sales initiatives steady gross margins and tight expense cost controls in addition we further improved the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows with effective working capital management as we execute on our growth plans progress in these fundamental areas supports our ongoing investment in opportunities such as acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases now turning to our guidance for the full year on the revenue side we are maintaining our guidance for total sales to be at plus  to plus  for the full year among our business segments we are maintaining our automotive sales guidance at plus  to plus  for the full year and were increasing our office guidance for sales to be plus  to plus  from the original amount of down  to up  we are lowering our industrial sales to flat to up  from the previous plus  to plus  and were reducing the electrical sales outlook to down  to down  from the previous up  to up  this sales outlook includes all acquisitions that have closed through july  as well as the atco  industrial acquisition that paul mentioned earlier on the earnings side we are updating our earnings guidance to be  to  from the previous range of  to  for the full year so this completes our prepared remarks and we would just close by saying thank you to all of our gpc associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the success of gpc paul ill turn it back over to you paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thank you carol a good update on the quarter so without a doubt we are experiencing a challenging quarter and frankly it has been a challenging six months but as you can tell from our guidance we are planning for an improved second half to the year and our teams are energized to execute on the action steps we outlined earlier we look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead so now well turn it back to the operator and carol and i will take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and well take our first question from matthew fassler with goldman sachs matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co thanks a lot good morning carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co and tom all the best to you as you continue to move forward i have two sets of questions the first relates to the automotive business it was interesting that you talked about june being flat compared to april up slightly even as some of the weathersensitive businesses really popped with some of the heat that we saw in parts of the country so can you talk about whats transpiring with other categories and how weatherrelated softness away from the areas like batteries might be just sort of how we got to flat rather than an increase with some of the weather businesses surging late in the quarter paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president and are you referencing specifically the month of june matt matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co i believe so im talking about the cadence that you paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yes matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co spelled out where i think april was up low singles may down low to mid singles and june flat i believe that related to your samestore sales number though im not sure paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yes so productrelated movement were seeing is certainly batteries were soft in the quarter ride control was soft in the quarter however we saw a slowing in our brakes business in the quarter which we attribute some of that we believe to some of our brakes business probably moved into the first quarter given the warmer temps on the plus side were continuing to see nice growth out of our import lines were seeing nice growth out of our tool and equipment categories but unfortunately they werent enough to offset some of the softness we saw in the other categories matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co and as were  or so days into a new quarter any sense of how the current run rate compares to what you saw in june paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yeah i would have to tell you july – matt even though were only a couple of weeks in and its looking a lot like june its choppy is the best way i think i could describe it the hot weather has to be a benefit to us and we believe with the continuing warm temps were seeing across the country will be a benefit to us and related to that we are seeing those products that are related to the hot temps products like batteries products like rotating electrical and our ac is picking up so thats why were cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co got it and then my second question relates to industrial and specifically to the margin trends within that business historically the gross was within industrial i believe were largely volumedriven and tied closely to volume rebates you had a quarter where i think the volumes were not quite up to your expectations the margins was quite good and carol on the call you cited gross margins within that business so any sense of the margin dynamics beneath the surface in industrial please carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i guess and youre exactly right we certainly have headwinds on the volume incentives in that business what weve been pleased to see is for the first six months of the year industrials core gross margin has improved and thats due to a lot of things that they put in place over the last  months or so and its both on the buy side and the sell side and those things have been put in place and it helped  their gross profit we had for the six months a slight decrease in their volume incentives but they were flat in the quarter and additionally on the sga side theyve adjusted their cost structure to be more in line with the revenues so its the combination of those things so i would say that were really pleased to see what they did in q and we are expecting a slightly better second half for the industrial business on the topline so hopefully we can maintain that slight margin improvement as we finish out the year matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co got it and understood thank you so much guys carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thanks matt operator thank you well take our next question from seth basham with wedbush securities seth m basham  wedbush securities inc thanks a lot and good morning and best of luck tom carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning seth thomas c gallagher  chairman thank you seth seth m basham  wedbush securities inc first question is just on the difference regionally between – well within the auto parts business if you could provide some color as to how the regions performed through the quarters the delta between the central and eastern as well as the rest of the business say from april may relative to june paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yeah its a bit like we saw in the previous quarter seth the cold weather in the northern division so i called out specifically the central and the northeast the delta between those businesses and some of our southern businesses our southeastern even down into florida atlantic even out west was a significant gap were talking close to  basis points  basis points gap between those that are performing well and those that are continuing to be challenged seth m basham  wedbush securities inc got it so thats basispoint to basispoint gap was that for the full quarter or do you see that gap narrow as you moved into june with the weather improvement paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president no that was full quarter seth m basham  wedbush securities inc got it and did the gap narrow in june paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president not – its not much were pretty consistent throughout the quarter in both the northern divisions as well as those warmer weather divisions seth m basham  wedbush securities inc okay great and then second question is just on major accounts a slowdown there in major accounts can you provide any color on that maybe like you have done for the industrial large customers how many up or down or whats driving the slowdown in major accounts do you lose customers just any other color will be helpful there paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yeah we stay close to our major customers as you would imagine seth and have a lot of conversations not all of them are down but i would tell you that we have seen a drop in their business we discussed with them often how their business is trending their tire sales have been challenged and those big tire guys that we do business with so again i dont think boy i can tell you we havent lost any of our big major customers and i dont believe were losing share in any of our major customers i would tell you that i think our business is the reflection of their business and i would also share seth that as we look at the automotive aftermarket in general we have had many toptotop meetings with many of our big suppliers here in recent weeks and months we do have constant dialogue with our major accounts at our napa autocare centers and again that sluggishness that we experienced in our numbers what we hear is all of those parties that were discussing with it are seeing similar results seth m basham  wedbush securities inc understood best of luck for improvement in the second half paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thanks seth carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks seth operator thank you well take our next question from greg melich with evercore isi greg melich  evercore isi hey thanks i want to follow up a little bit on the industrial business and then sga paul you mentioned some signs of stability in the industrial business although if you think about the number of categories that were up or down being the same as last quarter and industrial production seems to be a little bit better than your actual sales growth or organic what are those specific signs of stability that youre pointing to then i wanted to follow up with carol paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yeah so if i look at the numbers greg that weve seen quartertoquarter since back in early  where our sales were declining dramatically from one quarter to the next culminating in an  drop in q we rebounded if you want to call it that to a low singledigit increase in q and weve seen that again in q so when i say stabilizing it has stabilized from really the drop that we were seeing – significant drops that we were seeing in  in talking to our team our motion business in canada has seemed to stabilize and even is showing some slight improvement we watch very closely our project work and our project work – well the projects are smaller than we would like theyre steady and the number of projects that we see out there are steady so were hopeful and were starting to see it play out in the numbers a bit at our industrial business which also impacts our electrical that has bottomed out and hopefully well see a better second half greg melich  evercore isi great and carol what was the thing helping you to actually take down sga dollars i mean you did it in the first quarter and in the second quarter can we assume that sga dollars are down in the back half as well carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i guess theres a lot of activities going on across all of our businesses we said that each business a lot of our investments are in technology and productivity so as we can put in some of these efficiencies we would be improving our volume per employee so certainly looking at efficiencies in distribution centers also youre just adjusting your cost structure to a different level of revenue so on the industrial side and looking at some of their facilities and looking at their operations and making adjustments to say where were not going to have business in certain areas and possibly we need to go from three branches to two branches and so i think its a number of projects going on our automotive folks have done a very good job on sga and even with a little softer q they still have some sga improvement so we would expect it to continue we need to have a little bit better second half which were forecasting on the revenue and we would expect these things to stay in place yes greg melich  evercore isi thats great good luck paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thank you carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you greg operator thank you well take our next question from chris bottiglieri with wolfe research chris bottiglieri  wolfe research llc hi thank you for taking my question i had a couple of questions on industrial a few of your competitors seem to have referenced furloughs and plant shutdown have you seen anything similar or any reason why your customer mix might not be feeling the same headwinds paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president we have chris were seeing certainly some of the same things i think our competitors and other folks in the industrial world are seeing if we look at specifically some of the big oil and gas producers which has a big impact on not just our industrial business but our automotive as well the thought is that and it appears that some of the large oil producers are set to weather their storm but many of the small oil producers are going under and i dont know that thats going to change much going forward chris bottiglieri  wolfe research llc got you and then taking all the context i mean a  organic decline really isnt that bad do you think relative to your performance to peers like what do you think is driving that right now is it your maintenance mix versus new equipment are there any current growth drivers that youve added that are allowing to take share right now like what are you seeing in that business paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president well certainly chris some of the new focus product category that we have gotten into in recent years products like industrial supply safety supply material handling equipment those products and product lines are performing well and actually are generating increases yearoveryear where were seeing some of the pressure is on the traditional industrial products hydraulics bearings power transmission but i think that much like our strategy in our office products business as we segue into new categories growth categories thats certainly helping our numbers chris bottiglieri  wolfe research llc got you then actually one last followup related to that in terms of office i mean obviously youve done a nice job of diversifying into jansan and some other growth categories but what are your core like technology office products how are those performing right now and is there a point in time where you see that business becomes less of a headwind to your consolidated office number paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yeah our tech products – our tech categories were down in the quarter chris and our team is certainly focused on getting that back in the plus column but for now that is a – our tech business is a bit of a headwind our strategy is i think weve articulated in the past is continuing to drive our overall office products business more into the facility breakroom safety product categories youre seeing that with most of the acquisitions that weve completed of late certainly the most recent being the safety zone and the division of rochester midland so we believe that that tech headwind will become less and less of a factor as we move forward chris bottiglieri  wolfe research llc got you okay cool thank you for the help  paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president youre welcome thank you carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks chris operator thank you well take our next question from elizabeth suzuki from bank of america merrill lynch elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch hi guys if we look at organic revenue growth backing out the fx impact and positive contribution from acquisitions every business segment was down yearoveryear and for auto it sounds like you attributed that to weather specifically is there anyway to quantify what that growth would have been if weather had been consistent yearoveryear and is midsingledigit growth for the second half of the year achievable for that business paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president im sorry elizabeth are you referring specifically to automotive or across all four elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch to auto specifically paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president okay so auto in the first half of the year our core automotive business was actually up  and our expectation is that in the second half of the year that we are going to generate low to midsingledigit growth in our core automotive business and that does not include the potential assistance well get from acquisitions elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch okay great paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president and elizabeth if you were to ask me as a followup so how do you intend to do that i would tell you that were still very focused on our core initiatives in automotive while the quarter was certainly not up to our expectations by no means are we in a panic mode and going to shift our focus we have terrific opportunities to continue to grow our retail sales we are rolling out our top store initiative which will as mentioned in my comments will total  stores in  well reinvigorate our business in our napa autocare center and then new distribution will be a factor as well so were confident well drive the kind of numbers that we talked about in the second half elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch okay and do you think without the weather impact the second quarter might have seen that kind of low singledigit growth in core for auto paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president one can only assume elizabeth if you look at our first quarter certainly we were there if you look at our previous number of quarters certainly we were there so q we believe is an outlier and again i think that the key initiatives that our team is focused on will get our business back on track in the second half of the year elizabeth lane suzuki  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks very much paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thanks for your questions operator thank you well now move on to christopher horvers with jpmorgan christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning and congrats tom on all your success as a ceo over the year and paul congrats to you and good fortune to you as you move forward as ceo as well paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thank you chris christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc a couple of followup questions at this point so you talked about june flat july choppy like june flattish whats still soft if youre seeing some of the weathersensitive business pop what categories continue to be a drag in performance paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yeah as we saw in the second quarter chris its still some of those same core lines its ride control its brake business our brake business we have been on a tremendous run over the last six quarters to eight quarters in our brake business and were seeing that tail off just a bit again there is nothing that we have fundamentally changed we havent raised prices we havent changed product categories so those big categories ride control brakes thats where were seeing some of the softness which were certainly trying to outrun with the growth that were seeing in tool and equipment imports and in our temp related businesses christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc and so as you – i guess do we have to wait around for – because it sounds like some of thats like its corrosion from the winter that didnt happen its potholes that didnt happen and so do we have to wait around for the winter to see improvements like – forget your initiatives but maybe just the industry growth rates do you have to wait around for the winter to see improvements in those categories or is it – does  suggest that well the further you get away that drag mitigates and you can start to see growth and maybe later in the third quarter in those businesses paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president i think youre spot on chris with that comment i referenced in my prepared remarks what we saw back in  and i do believe that will be the case but i can assure you our team is not sitting on the sideline they have a tremendous sense of urgency no panic but a tremendous sense of urgency working with our good customers out in the field certainly working closely with our autocare centers to understanding where they need our support how we can help them grow their business so we are intensely focused on getting our growth curve back going in the right direction in q q and as we have projected on our numbers we do believe that that will be the case christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc just to clarify you mean as the further you get away from the winter you can start to see growth as you proceed through the year you dont have to wait for winter weather to reinvigorate those businesses paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thats correct thats correct christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then on july someone asked about the regional differences in june is the july acceleration in some of those weathersensitive categories more focused in the northern tier of the country paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president i think its maybe just a bit early to go there chris you had the july  holiday where we lost essentially a week i think it might be a bit early to go there but i will tell you that the hot temps that were seeing heck i heard st louis is supposed to be  degreesplus that goes across the northeast thats going to drive business and its going to drive certainly those temprelated products theres just no two ways about it weve seen it in the past and i dont think  will be any different christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc and then one last clarifying question to your response when you say sort of july looks like june theres no negative calendar impact in there youre sourcing on the days adjusted business  business looks similar right paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president correct yes sir christopher michael horvers  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks very much guys paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president all right thanks chris carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks chris operator thank you well now take our next question from tony cristello with bbt capital markets anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets thank you congrats tom and paul welcome and look forward to working with you as we move forward paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thank you tony anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets i wanted to talk a little bit more about the initiatives you have in place to sort of drive the sales growth and you laid out some of those related to auto but if you look across your four segments and then identify the four sort of buckets that you attempt whether its  or acquisition or digital or expansion of footprint can you sort of maybe give some more color of how you would align each one and where the most opportunity along those four buckets would be for each one paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president well certainly were looking at strategic acquisitions tony in every single one of our businesses and i think that in  weve had impactful acquisitions in three of our four businesses we have activity going in in all four but we have closed on deals in industrial office and of course automotive as it relates to specifically expanding footprint both domestically and internationally thats really targeted at our automotive businesses and as you know we have new distribution initiatives in place both in the us mexico canada australia and new zealand i mentioned earlier weve had terrific success in our gpc asiapac business and thats a business well continue to grow as we look at our digital capability that goes across all four businesses and were driving ecommerce initiatives across every one of our businesses and then of course a greater share of wallet which really that underpins all of our efforts again that growth goes across all four businesses  and really is that what we need to drive our core growth anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets and then especially on the distribution side are you – as you continue to crosssell and leverage across each of the segments some of the sga savings is that perhaps coming from your ability to be more effective across your distribution at all your locations paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president we believe so tony certainly as we look at some of the recent acquisitions the bolton acquisitions that weve done the safety zone would fit that category rochester midland that jansan acquisition we believe we have opportunities to crosssell and take full advantage of the structure or the infrastructure we have in place and i would say the same as it relates to acquisitions that weve done in the automotive space whether itd be on our import business or our heavyduty business were leveraging that structure that weve had in place for many many years across all of our businesses carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president and i think one thing i may add – tony one thing i may add and you said on just sga we also see opportunities that come on the cost of goods sold side as well so on these acquisitions – and we look at the product categories were able to take that and leverage across the organization our total spend so well see that coming from the gross margin side and the sga side anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets so its just a   this continue for a period of time beyond as a result of integration and efficiency gain carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president correct anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets okay and then last one question i just want to clarify what was your revised guidance on the industrial did you say down to flat is that correct  carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes our industrial is going to be flat to up  for our new guidance anthony f cristello  bbt capital markets flat to up okay perfect thank you carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president flat to up  paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president all right thanks tony operator we will now take our next question from scot ciccarelli with rbc capital markets scot ciccarelli  rbc capital markets llc hey guys how are you paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president hey scot carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey scot scot ciccarelli  rbc capital markets llc hi specifically asking about auto at this point any change in the competitive environment worth noting theres obviously been a lot of changes in the industry over the last lets call it  months or so i think we also kind of generally get the weather impact given the industrys experience in  but there was also a period in  and  where your auto business started to significantly lag the performance of a bunch of your peers and if i remember right it was a function of uncompetitive pricing in a couple of categories in fact it may have even been ride control now that i think about it so any change overall in the competitive environment and then also specifically on your pricing relative to the market thanks paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yes so i would say this scot on the first question as it relates to our competition we have not seen any major shift in the competitive landscape i think pricing remains sane across all of our competitors look everybody is scratching and clawing for market share in a challenging environment but weve not seen any major shift across our key competitors as it relates to our pricing by product or pricing by product category i recall quite well your reference to  and  and that did occur and we did adjust and i think we certainly benefited from it we dont see anywhere at this point where were an outlier in a particular product category our guys do price jobs on a very regular basis we get input from the field on a daily and weekly basis both from our stores as well as our independent owners and there is always the occasional tweak we make here and there based on the competitive landscape but now i would say generally we are not seeing any significant change in the competitive landscape scot ciccarelli  rbc capital markets llc and paul can you remind us how you did wind up in the pricing quandary that you did back in   because i thought you guys were doing kind of a price scans and competitive pricing general check if you will back then as well im just wondering how it wound up gaining  so skewed relative to the market paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yeah so i joined the automotive parts group scot in  and if i recall the shift that occurred and maybe we were a bit slow on the trigger was our competitors dropped the prices and certainly our retail competitors dropped their prices specifically we ultimately regrouped reacted and the business bounced right back but when i joined in  we were on our way out of that scot ciccarelli  rbc capital markets llc got you okay very helpful guys thanks a lot paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president all right thank you carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks scot operator and well take our next question from bret jordan with jefferies bret jordan  jefferies llc hey good morning guys paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president hey bret bret jordan  jefferies llc congratulations to tom and paul also paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thank you bret bret jordan  jefferies llc you called out the energy market as another region that had some softness and is that specifically texas and oklahoma does it spread any further around that range and then maybe could you compare you said maybe  basis points or  basis points spread between the north and the central in the northeastern markets versus a strong market comp could you tell us maybe how the energy market comp compared to the average also paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yes so when we look at our energyrelated market bret certainly the first place everybody goes is texas oklahoma and i get that and certainly that has been impacted no doubt and continues to be and thats not just in automotive we see that in industrial as well but we also see it in the fracking regions so we see it in portions of the mountain division we see it in montana dakotas a bit we see it in pennsylvania where fracking was blowing and going here a couple of years ago and in addition we also see it up in the oil sands in canada certainly alberta has been a headwind for both our automotive business in canada as well as our industrial business so yes not just oklahoma and texas i wish it was and then – im sorry bret your second question related to the northern division gap between their numbers and our warmer weather bret jordan  jefferies llc i was just going to ask you to compare your energy weakness to the rest of the market you said that the northern and northeastern was  basis points or  basis points spread i was wondering if you could sort of give us a feeling for how bad the energy market was relative to average also paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president its actually – if we focus in on your opening comments there texas oklahoma are very similar its that basis point or basis point gap i mentioned mountain as one of our better performing divisions so were able to overcome some of the shortfall in the dakotas with some strong performance in the denver area for instance that have made up for that bret jordan  jefferies llc okay and then a final question you talked a couple of times about air conditioning or temperaturerelated products being up doubledigits are instock levels fine there is demand exceeding supply or is everything okay in the inventory paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president yes i will tell you bret on the inventory comment we are looking at our inventories across our entire business we have a new predictive modeling engine that weve put into place and were looking at our inventories and especially in some of the categories where were challenged and we are pumping up our inventories in some of those categories our ac products we have not had an issue at least that im aware of at this point i think were wellpositioned as we race head long into the back half of the summer bret jordan  jefferies llc okay great thank you paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president all right thanks chris operator thank you well now take our final question from brian sponheimer with gabelli brian c sponheimer  gabelli  company inc hi tom hi paul congratulations to you both thomas c gallagher  chairman thank you brian paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thank you brian brian c sponheimer  gabelli  company inc two real quick ones carol another great job on working capital was any portion of that attributable to changes in currency carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president no well there was – our currencyneutral numbers were smaller this quarter than they have been in the past but the bulk of that working capital improvement is just coming from accounts payable and its broadly all of the segments quite honestly and then really where we saw a nice improvement this quarter was inventory we had about  million source of cash from our inventories this quarter and that was – a lot of that came from automotive so we were pleased to see additional improvement coming out of inventory and we feel like well have some more in the back half brian c sponheimer  gabelli  company inc okay thats great and encouraging and then just on getting my numbers right for the napa comps companyowned stores were down  in the us were they down international carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president they were actually up international brian c sponheimer  gabelli  company inc okay carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president we had said they were up so i think canada was low singledigits and australia new zealand was mid singledigits paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president and brian just to clarify one point you mentioned our companyowned stores our companyowned stores samestore sales were flat in the quarter overall our automotive was down  us automotive brian c sponheimer  gabelli  company inc thats why i asked okay great well thank you very much and good luck in the coming months paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thanks very much brian carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks brian operator and well now take our followup question from matthew fassler with goldman sachs matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co hi sorry to prolong the call but i just had felt the need to follow up on brians last question if we think about that delta between the flat comp in the us and the total down  is that lower sell in to the franchise stores or to the network or some other factor driving that decline paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president no youve got it thats exactly it matt matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co any sense of their sellthrough relative to that decline or was it that tough to depot back an inventory because thats a bit of a different pace of business from what youre seeing at the companyowned stores paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president it is our independent owners are competing just fine in the marketplace i dont think theres anything specific to our big independent owners they did do a little bit of an inventory build towards the end of q which may have had an impact but no we dont see we certainly dont see anything different happening on the independent side from our companyowned stores matthew j fassler  goldman sachs  co understood thank you so much paul d donahue  chief executive officer and president thank you matt operator and that concludes the questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the call back over to management for additional and closing remarks carol b yancey  chief financial officer  executive vice president
