is given to every malware threat that has been collected and analyzed through our malware research center the esg threat scorecard evaluates and ranks each threat by using several metrics such as trends incidents and severity over time in addition to the effective scoring for each threat we are able to interpret anonymous geographic data to list the top three countries infected with a particular threat the data used for the esg threat scorecard is updated daily and displayed based on trends for a day period the esg threat scorecard is a useful tool for a wide array of computer users from end users seeking a solution to remove a particular threat or security experts pursuing analysis and research data on emerging threats each of the fields listed on the esg threat scorecard containing a specific value are as follows ranking the current ranking of a particular threat among all the other threats found on our malware research database threat level the level of threat a particular pc threat could have on an infected computer the threat level is based on a particular threats behavior and other risk factors we rate the threat level as low medium or high the different threat levels are discussed in the spyhunter risk assessment model infected pcs the number of confirmed and suspected cases of a particular threat detected on infected pcs retrieved from diagnostic and scan log reports generated by spyhunters spyware scanner  change the daily percent change in the frequency of infected pcs of a specific threat the formula for percent changes results from current trends of a specific threat an increase in the rankings of a specific threat yields a recalculation of the percentage of its recent gain when a specific threats ranking decreases the percentage rate reflects its recent decline for a specific threat remaining unchanged the percent change remains in its current state the  change data is calculated and displayed in three different date ranges in the last  hours  days and  days next to the percentage change is the trend movement a specific malware threat does either upward or downward in the rankings each level of movement is color coded a green uparrow ∧ indicates a rise a red downarrow ∨ indicates a decline and a brown equal symbol  indicates no change or plateaued top  countries infected lists the top three countries a particular threat has targeted the most over the past month this data allows pc users to track the geographic distribution of a particular threat throughout the world ranking  threat level infected pcs   change  days
