found to have been in existence de jure in  these are held by different families and are now held to be distinct titles when the earldom of devonshire was created there was already in existence an earldom of derby it would therefore have been unlikely that the cavendish family would have chosen derbyshire as their new honour it is much more likely that the title of devonshire was chosen deliberately the cavendish peerage was granted in   years after the last holder of an earlier creation of the earldom of devonshire charles blount th lord mountjoy had died the devon earldom had earlier been held by the ancient de redvers family and by the courtenay family who had married in the tudor era the daughter of king edward iv princess katherine of york and whose son was later made marquess of exeter the marquess of exeter was executed for treason and his son was probably poisoned in  from that date the peerage was vacant by choosing devonshire the cavendish family who had only recently arrived socially on the political scene were aligning themselves with some of the oldest families in england it should be noted that historically devon and devonshire were alternating terms and as late as the eighteenth century georgiana cavendish was sometimes referred to as the duchess of devon in fictionedit the fifth duke and duchess of devonshire are portrayed in the  film the duchess directed by saul dibb the film is based on amanda foremans biography of the scandalous thcentury english aristocrat georgiana cavendish duchess of devonshire portrayed by keira knightley and

to have been in existence de jure in  these are held by different families and are now held to be distinct titles when the earldom of devonshire was created there was already in existence an earldom of derby it would therefore have been unlikely that the cavendish family would have chosen derbyshire as their new honour it is much more likely that the title of devonshire was chosen deliberately the cavendish peerage was granted in   years after the last holder of an earlier creation of the earldom of devonshire charles blount th lord mountjoy had died the devon earldom had earlier been held by the ancient de redvers family and by the courtenay family who had married in the tudor era the daughter of king edward iv princess katherine of york and whose son was later made marquess of exeter the marquess of exeter was executed for treason and his son was probably poisoned in  from that date the peerage was vacant by choosing devonshire the cavendish family who had only recently arrived socially on the political scene were aligning themselves with some of the oldest families in england it should be noted that historically devon and devonshire were alternating terms and as late as the eighteenth century georgiana cavendish was sometimes referred to as the duchess of devon in fictionedit the fifth duke and duchess of devonshire are portrayed in the  film the duchess directed by saul dibb the film is based on amanda foremans biography of the scandalous thcentury english aristocrat georgiana cavendish duchess of devonshire portrayed by keira knightley and her relationship with the duke ralph fiennes and his next wife lady elizabeth foster along with jane austen the fifth duke and his second wife appear soon after georgianas death in jane and the stillroom maid a murder mystery

of the title of earl of devon then held to be extinct but which was found to have been in existence de jure in  these are held by different families and are now held to be distinct titles when the earldom of devonshire was created there was already in existence an earldom of derby it would therefore have been unlikely that the cavendish family would have chosen derbyshire as their new honour it is much more likely that the title of devonshire was chosen deliberately the cavendish peerage was granted in   years after the last holder of an earlier creation of the earldom of devonshire charles blount th lord mountjoy had died the devon earldom had earlier been held by the ancient de redvers family and by the courtenay family who had married in the tudor era the daughter of king edward iv princess katherine of york and whose son was later made marquess of exeter the marquess of exeter was executed for treason and his son was probably poisoned in  from that date the peerage was vacant by choosing devonshire the cavendish family who had only recently arrived socially on the political scene were aligning themselves with some of the oldest families in england it should be noted that historically devon and devonshire were alternating terms and as late as the eighteenth century georgiana cavendish was sometimes referred to as the duchess of devon in fictionedit the fifth duke and duchess of devonshire are portrayed in the  film the duchess directed by saul dibb the film is based on amanda foremans biography of the scandalous thcentury english aristocrat georgiana cavendish

government board but then resigned and after opposing the first home rule bill became the leader of the liberal unionists after the general election of  hartington declined to become prime minister preferring instead to hold the balance of power in the house of commons and give support from the back benches to the second conservative government of the lord salisbury early in  after the resignation of lord randolph churchill salisbury offered to step down and serve in a government under hartington who now declined the premiership for the third time instead the liberal unionist george goschen accepted the exchequer in churchills place having succeeded as duke of devonshire in  and entered the house of lords where in  he formally moved for the rejection of the second home rule bill devonshire eventually joined salisburys third government in  as lord president of the council devonshire was not asked to become prime minister when lord salisbury retired in favour of his nephew arthur balfour in  he resigned from the government in  and from the liberal unionist association the following spring in protest at joseph chamberlains tariff reform scheme devonshire said of chamberlains proposals i venture to express the opinion that chamberlain will find among the projects and plans which he will be called upon to discuss none containing a more socialistic principle than that which is embodied in his own scheme which whether it can properly be described as a scheme of protection or not is certainly a scheme under which the state is to undertake to regulate the course of commerce and of industry and tell us where we are to buy where we are to sell what commodities we are to manufacture at home and what we may continue if we think right to import from other countries balfour trying to juggle different factions had allowed both chamberlain and free trade supporters to resign from the government hoping that devonshire would remain for the sake of balance

in london and also in the carpet gardens at eastbourne legacyedit upon receiving news of the dukes death the house of lords took the unprecedented step of adjourning in his honour margot asquith said the duke of devonshire was a man whose like we shall never see again he stood by himself and could have come from no country in the world but england he had the figure and appearance of an artisan with the brevity of a peasant the courtesy of a king and the noisy sense of humour of a falstaff he gave a great wheezy guffaw at all the right things and was possessed of endless wisdom he was perfectly disengaged from himself fearlessly truthful and without pettiness of any kind historian jonathan parry claimed that he inherited the whig belief in the duty of political leadership afforced by the intellectual notions characteristic of welleducated propertied early to midvictorian liberals a confidence that the application of free trade rational public administration scientific enquiry and a patriotic defence policy would promote britains international greatness—in which he strongly believed—and her economic and social progresshe became a model of the dutiful aristocrat it has been said that he was the best excuse that the last halfcentury has produced for the continuance of the peerages with  years of government service the duke of devonshire his is the fourth longest

size categories what size fan do i need  to   to   to   to  the latest trend in ceiling fans is big a decade ago ceiling fans were pretty much only available in   and  sizes the most common size being  in the last several years there has been a huge influx of larger diameter residential ceiling fans hit the market and the most popular size is now the  ceiling fan but the latest trend is toward very large ceiling fans with blade spans over even as large as  these extra large fans are not only being used in great rooms but average size living rooms because they spread the airflow more evenly throughout the room on the flip side there are now a lot more choices when it comes to ceiling fans for small rooms there are now  to  ceiling fans being made for walk in closets laundry rooms kitchens and hallways why have large ceiling fans become so popular you may have seen an extremely large diameter ceiling fan in an airport convention center or large industrial complex these are called hvls high volume low speed fans and range anywhere from  feet to  feet in diameter hvls fans like these are sold by the big ass fan company and similar brands that target the industrial fan market although they are far too large and heavy for residential applications their style and functionality has inspired some residential ceiling fan manufacturers to make similar fans that can be installed in your home these larger fans have caught on quickly and we now have over  ceiling fans to offer that are  or larger and over  that are larger than  read more about choosing the right size ceiling fan below so what size fan do i buy the popularity of large diameter fans is causing the fan industry to rethink the whole size recommendation thing altogether and most of the size recommendation charts you find are based on what was available over  years ago if you ask us we will say ignore the size charts and buy the biggest fan with the highest wind speed that will fit reasonably in the space leave at least  or  feet of space between the end of the fan blade to the closest wall to determine the largest size fan you can put in a room  feet for ceilings  feet or less  feet for higher ceilings for example a small  x  room could accommodate a  to  fan would we then recommend a  fan for this room probably not more likely we would suggest a fan  to  but it could be quite striking visually if the ceiling is  high so a little common sense and personal taste needs to be factored into the equation a larger fan can provide better airflow throughout the room as well as create a dramatic design statement plus most of the large fans have relatively low profiles and small motor to blade span proportions so they are not as overbearing as you might think keep in mind that although larger fans typically have much higher cfm ratings the actual wind speed may be lower because they spin slower so you can expect less direct wind chill effect but the gentle breeze will cover a much larger area read more about the importance of wind speed here in a recent ceiling fan training webinar produced by the ala american lighting association joseph a reybarreau aia ies associate professor college of design university of kentucky confirms what we are saying in this quote the reality is that we are moving in to a point in time where people are using bigger fans in even smaller spaces and this is the recommendation that i give to my own clientsis that the smaller fans typically are not going to help you a lot if you are not immediately under the fan so if youre really trying to move air within a large volume of space or even within a smaller room the larger fan is typically going to do the job very very efficiently but generally speaking in a great room it was historically  or larger although that number is now becoming the norm for many other even smaller rooms of course there are limits to where that size should be so i would not typically recommend a fan where the fan blades are probably closer than about  feet from the edge of the room that would be from a design point of view my own personal barrier where i would stop still not sure what size fan to buy give us a call at  or email a picture of your room along with the dimensions to gregthansenwholesalecom ceiling fan size recommendation calculator this calculator is based on the current trend to use larger fans in smaller rooms based on this new trend we recommend this choose the largest fan with the highest wind speed that will fit into the space without overwhelming it visually in rooms larger than  x  leave  to  feet from the blades to the shortest wall to determine the largest size we would recommend visually select the dimensions of your room round to nearest foot room size  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet x  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet  feet ceiling height less than  feet  feet  feet over  feet how to choose the right size ceiling fan choose the largest fan with the highest wind speed that will fit into the space without overwhelming it visually to calculate the size of the largest fan that will fit the room just leave  to  feet between the closest wall and the tip of the blades  feet for ceilings  feet or less  feet for higher ceilings of course if you do not go larger than that you are ok on the maximum size from a performance standpoint visually the choice is more personal as some people simply do not like the looks of a fan so largealthough the trend today is just thatbig the vast majority of the cooling effect you feel from a ceiling fan is in the column of air directly beneath the fan blades the further you get away from the fan the less airflow you will feel there is a significant drop off in airflow just outside of  feet from the tip of the fan blades this is a real surprise to many consumers who install a fan in the center of a room when their seating area is  or  feet away our calculator will give you a range of sizes that may be appropriate for your room but the largest is the size we recommend most ultimately the right size fan for a room is not determined by the size of the room alone you must also consider the layout of the room where the fan will be positioned in relation to the area where the airflow is most needed as well as how high the ceiling is because we are not aware of any limiting factors you may have in your situation we cannot say for sure that the largest fan we recommend will actually be appropriate for your room just keep in mind that the larger the fan blades are the more area the fan will cover and the closer you are to the fan the cooler you will feel heres a scenario to consider lets say you have a small room that has a normal height ceiling if you have walnut furniture and choose a bronze colored fan with walnut blades that matches the decor in your room the fan will look and feel like it is barely missing your head as you walk under it so you better purchase a smaller fan to help alleviate this feeling however the smaller size fan may not move enough air if it gets really hot in that room so a good alternative would be to purchase a normal size fan that blends in with the ceiling so if your ceiling is white purchase a white fan if your ceiling is acoustic purchase a textured white fan the fan will feel like it is higher up over your head so you can purchase a slightly larger fan that has better performance features some people might sayjust put a hugger fan in so it doesnt hang down so low our response to that is that most hugger fans dont move much air and really dont save but  or  inches in head room there are some exceptions to this but you really need to know the fan business to know what they are so each room has its own considerations when it comes to choosing the right size and style of ceiling fan that fits best if you have any questions that we have not answered here just give us a

there are  types of outdoor ceiling fans those that are ul listed for damp locations and those ul listed for wet locations if you are installing a ceiling fan outdoors building safety codes require that you install an outdoor ceiling fan with the correct ul listed approval rating depending on where the fan is installed what is the difference between wet rated and damp rated outdoor ceiling fans wet rated outdoor fans can be installed anywhere indoors or outdoors and damp rated fans can only be installed in dry locations or damp covered areas that are not exposed directly to rain so any outdoor location that is directly exposed to rain requires wet rated ceiling fan this includes uncovered areas partially covered areas or covered areas where rain or water from sprinklers can come in contact with the fan all other outdoor areas that are covered or not exposed directly to rain can use a wet rated or damp rated fan fans that are not rated for damp or wet locations can only be installed indoors both wet and damp location fans can also be used indoors and are highly recommended indoors for climates that are very humid or areas in the home that are damp such as bathrooms or laundry rooms examples of where to install a wet rated fan a patio porch or other outdoor living area with a lattice or screened coveringor no covering at all a pergola or partially covered gazebo a narrow porch or lanai where the fan is close enough to the edge for rain to blow on it any indoor or outdoor location close to the ocean or in humid climates read more below examples of where to install a damp rated fan a covered patio or wide porch where rain cannot reach the fan screened in porch or sunroom a gazebo that is completely covered and rain cannot reach the fan any covered area over a pool indoor or outdoor bathrooms that have a tub or shower laundry rooms indoors in humid climates webmasters advice did you know that you can hose off a wet rated outdoor ceiling fan to clean it well you can outdoor fans can get dirty rather quickly so being able to hose it off can be a true blessing you cant do this to a damp rated or indoor fan so remember this when deciding which type to buy can you install an indoor ceiling fan outdoors the answer is no you should never install an indoor ceiling fan outdoors even if it is a screened in area ceiling fans that are not ul listed for outdoors are not designed to handle excess moisture and harsh elements such as uv radiation and fluctuations in temperature simply put an indoor ceiling fan will not survive outdoors even more they can short out and create a potential fire hazard so it is critical that the correct type of ceiling fan be installed outdoors how are outdoor fans different than indoor fans in order for a ceiling fan to be rated for use outdoors it must be built to a different standard than fans made only for indoor use some of the differences include additional water resistant shielding around wires and other electrical components as well as the use of stainless steel screws and other hardware the exposed parts of the fan must have a weather and uv resistant coating or paint the blades are often made of abs plastic in order to avoid warping and deterioration over time light fixtures used on outdoor fans must also have additional protection from moisture and wet rated light fixtures may need to be completely sealed and water tight these additional features may add some additional cost to an outdoor ceiling fan but in most cases the added cost is minimal compared to the design limitations they create in other words some ceiling fans designed for use indoors simply cannot be made for use outdoors because it is not practical or possible to make them water resistant some popular ceiling fan styles can be made into outdoor fans with very little additional cost so manufacturers may choose to make them as wet rated outdoor fans so that people can use them in any location whether it be indoors or outdoors a great example is the emerson curva and emerson curva sky which are very popular for both indoor and outdoor use outdoor ceiling fans for salt air environments live near the beach the most durable ceiling fans currently being made for installations in salt air environments are made from marine grade stainless steel or cast poly resin these  fans are specifically designed to handle the most harsh exterior applications with excessive exposure to moisture and salt air matthews donaire stainless steel bronze matthews donaire stainless steel brushed minka aire concept wet stainless steel bronze minka aire concept wet stainless steel brushed minka aire conceptcast poly resin minka aire concept iicast poly resin  flush mount although there is no specific ul listing for fans used in salt air environments we offer the following advice for those who live near the ocean or a marine environment with salty air choose wet rated ceiling fans for both indoor and outdoor areas that are exposed to salt air fans made from cast poly resin or marine grade stainless steel are the very best for salt air environments if the above fans are not for you be sure to choose a fan that has a powder coat finish with a uv coating as opposed to a polished metal finish darker more rustic finishes will do best even if they do begin to show signs of rust over the years it will only add more character to the finish if you must choose a white or offwhite fan more expensive models over  will usually have a special uv coating that helps prevent yellowing and flaking if you prefer a metallic finish make sure you choose a high quality wet rated fan even if it is going into a damp location unless you choose marine grade stainless steel or cast poly resin you can expect some signs of rust over the years regardless of the quality avoid cheaper brands sold at home centers they simply will not hold up in salt air even if they are wet rated outdoor ceiling fans for high wind locations high wind locations many of our visitors come to us looking for replacement blades or blade holders that were broken by high winds in almost every case it was a low quality ceiling fan that had weak blade holders or cheap blades unfortunately replacement parts are not typically available for these types of fans and they end up having to buy a new fan although there are no ceiling fans specifically made for windy areas we have several recommendations that will help you choose from fans that are most likely to survive heavy winds choose a ceiling fan that does not have blade arms but rather one where the blades connect directly to the body of the fan these are known as unibody ceiling fans in the ceiling fan terminology broken blade arms are the  demise of a ceiling fan in high winds the minka aire concept i minka aire concept ii and minka aire traditional concept  are examples of such fans if you have a flat ceiling that is  feet high or less choose a flushmount fan with a unibody design fans that hang on a downrod can sway violently in strong wind which can cause the blades to hit the ceiling and break if you must choose a fan that hangs on a downrod because you have a higher ceiling buy a fan with abs plastic blades that are convex in shape as these will be less likely to break in the event the fan sways too much all of the minka aire concept fans listed above have such blades if you do not like the unibody style fans because they are too contemporary for your application be sure that the fan you buy has substantial blade holders like the casablanca heritage the heritage ceiling fans are also great for high ceilings because they have a very powerful motor and move lots of air no there are no ceiling fans that are designed with a quick release type of mounting hardware that makes them easy to remove when winds kick up no there are no ceiling fans that have blades designed for quick removal either yes many people have expressed the desire for such fansand we have suggested this to ceiling fan manufacturers indoor damp locations it is also recommended that damp or wet rated ceiling fans be used in any indoor location that is exposed to excess moisture such as bathrooms laundry rooms or simply in climates where there is a lot of moisture in the air particularly in areas close to the ocean or that have tropical climates the casablanca wailea  to the right is our most popular choice for bathrooms and laundry rooms outdoor ceiling fans require higher cfms airflow cfm airflow is a critical for outdoor ceiling fans ceiling fans cool you off by creating a breeze that causes a windchill effect they do not change the temperature of the air the amount of windchill that you feel is directly related to the amount of air the fan is capable of producing airflow for ceiling fans is measured in cfm cubic feet of air per minute nonenclosed outdoor living areas require more cfms than indoor or enclosed areas in an open area the airflow that you feel can be easily diluted because the air is not restricted by walls so it is critical to compare the cfms that an outdoor fan is capable of producing before you buy one  keeping cool in hot outdoor climates requires high cfms the hotter it is the more airflow you will need in order to keep cool so the amount of airflow that an outdoor ceiling fan generates is critical consideration the range of airflow that outdoor rated ceiling fans can produce is anywhere from  cfm to about  cfm ceiling fans that produce  to  cfm will not create a very noticeable windchill effect so are actually quite useless unless you are in a very small area that is directly beneath the fan we recommend fans that are between  cfm and  cfm if you want a fan that is capable of creating a cooling breeze the farther you are away from the fan the more cfms it must be able to produce to cool you off so if you have a high ceiling in an outdoor living area be sure to buy a larger more powerful fan that produces closer to  cfm  keeping bugs away requires high cfms another advantage of buying a ceiling fan that generates over  cfm is the ability to help keep pesky flies and bugs away from the area beneath the fan you will find that fans that produce  to  cfm do the best job at warding off bugs so not only is cfm important for keeping you cooler on hot summer days it is also a great benefit if you suffer from flying pests comparing outdoor ceiling fans read more more about cfms our website is the only site online that will show you a graph that compares the most important factors of ceiling fan performance
