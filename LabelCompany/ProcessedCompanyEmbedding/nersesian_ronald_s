strong fourth quarter with revenue at the high end of our guidance achieved earnings of  per share and generated  million in free cash flow second customers continue to increase investment in next generation technologies and keysight continues to innovate and expand its leadership in these important areas of the market third during fiscal year  the team executed well on its strategy to transform and position the company for growth and we made measureable progress on our key growth initiatives let’s begin with a brief overview of keysight’s fourth quarter performance we are pleased with our results and execution in the quarter we achieved earnings of  per share generated  million in free cash flow or  of revenue and delivered  million in revenue which was at the high end of our guidance additionally orders grew  yearoveryear to reach  million which is the highest level we have seen in the past four years neil will provide you with further detail on our fourth quarter financial results in a few minutes moving to our markets overall the dynamic we saw in the quarter remained relatively consistent with our expectations we continue to see softness in the broader communications market and in certain regions within europe while investments in the development of next generation technologies continued to grow more specifically we saw increased investment in the areas of g wireless lan high speed optical networks for data centers automotive alternative energy and leading edge semiconductor process technologies in g major players continued to accelerate development and timelines around the globe and we generated strong growth for our g solutions in the fourth quarter to highlight the growing momentum around g i would like to note several recent industry announcements ntt announced plans to begin its g trials in japan as early as may  just last week korea telecom declared that it aims to be the first to commercialize g in  which is one year ahead of its previously stated plans china mobile has deployed a wideband massive mimo site on its network in shanghai and verizon announced it is moving forward with its plans for g pilots beginning in  utilizing spectrum at very high frequencies is a key tenet behind g as mobile providers look for ways to cope with expanding amounts of mobile traffic proliferation of connected devices and the internet of things as well as to improve its overall customer experience for decades engineers in a variety of industries have counted on keysight for easier access to accurate repeatable measurements at even higher frequencies and wider bandwidths today we are the industry’s leading innovator in the commercialization of tools for millimeter wave simulation test and analysis in october we extended our leadership with an industry leading breakthrough in spectrum and signal analysis at millimeter wave frequencies our new signal analyzer is the first to provide continuous frequency coverage from three hertz to  gigahertz and spans across access front haul and back haul g applications in an integrated solution these tools can also be used for satellite communication and automotive radar applications moving to high speed optical networks for data centers deployment of  gig optical technologies throughout the datacenter and efforts to reduce power are driving the need to measure signal quality and integrity in the fourth quarter we continued to win deals and see strong demand for our optical and high speed digital test products and growing interest in  gig development our customers in this market include chip network equipment optical transceiver vendors and hyper scale datacenter operators at the european optical show in september keysight showcased new and enhanced solutions to help rd engineers master their  gig designs by making validation easier and speeding up the testing of components and systems in the automotive market the electronic content of cars continues to increase with numerous traditional car manufacturers accelerating their investments in electrified vehicles and autonomous driving areas of investment and development include powertrain electrification battery technology the connected car and radar technology these activities are still in the rd stage and are expected to be long term growth trends for this market keysight recently demonstrated more than  automotive design and test solutions across various technology domains including radar wireless millimeter wave high speed digital and power and energy we are leveraging our decade’s deep expertise in testing radar technologies for aerospace and defense applications to launch products that address the specific needs for the emerging autonomous driving market we recently introduced a new radar target simulator to help automotive electronic manufacturers confidently simulate various realistic scenarios moving onto our full year performance the keysight team executed well on its multiyear strategy to transform and position the company as a solutions leader in key next generation technologies as a reminder our ultimate goal is to drive above market growth in the long term and to create value for customers and shareholders in fiscal  we achieved  order growth and  revenue growth as we navigated a challenging market environment and executed on our strategy we remain committed to our key growth initiatives and made measurable progress first in wireless our focus on positioning keysight as the market leader in g is delivering results with our technical breadth and expertise in strategic engagement with customers and partners around the globe keysight continues to have leading edge solutions for g applications available when needed even as development schedules accelerate throughout the year orders for our g solutions surpassed expectations resulting in triple digit growth second in modular we achieved double digit order and revenue growth for our pxi and axi modular business for the year we introduced several new solutions for a variety of market applications and we received the frost  sullivan’s  growth excellence leadership award in recognition of our strong momentum in pxi based instrumentation third in software we also delivered double digit order and revenue growth led by our acquisition of anite and high single digit growth for our market leading design and simulation software solutions as part of our longer term strategy to expand our software innovation activities earlier this year we announced a software design center in conjunction with the georgia institute of technology in atlanta and our staffing plan there is ahead of schedule lastly in services while revenue was flat on a reported basis for the year we generated  order growth for the year multivendor calibration services showed strong success with aerospace and defense customers this is a key target market for keysight and we believe we have gained share overall we are pleased with our execution fiscal year  the strategic actions we have taken are strengthening our market position and creating new business opportunities investing in innovation regardless of short term market challenges is a critical element to our future success as a company in fiscal  we increased our rd investment by  while delivering industry leading nongaap operating margin of  we believe our investments are delivering abovemarket results as we exit the fourth quarter our accomplishments speak to the focus discipline and commitment of the keysight team to transform our company for growth and to create value for our customers and shareholders moving forward we will continue to innovate invest for long term growth and expand our leadership we are building on the moment we achieved in  with a robust pipeline of new services and solutions that have been identified by our industry teams working closely with leading edge customers while we expect continued headwinds in some of our markets we believe we are well positioned to deliver above market results now i’ll turn the call over to neil to provide more details on our q financial results as well as our first quarter guides neil dougherty today we reported fourth quarter revenue of  million compared with  million in the same period last year on a core basis which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions revenue decreased  regionally core revenue declined  in europe  in the americas  in japan and increased  in asia excluding japan in china we achieved our third consecutive quarter of double digit growth driven by strength in optical and semiconductor process solutions looking at our operational results gross margin was  a yearoveryear decrease of  basis points due to product mix for the quarter operating expenses totaled  million up  over last year and reflected higher sales cost given our strong order performance in the quarter this resulted in fourth quarter operating margin of  compared with  last year we reported net income of  million or  per share which was at the midpoint of our guidance range moving to the performance of our segments our communications solutions group or csg includes two primary end markets first is a commercial communications end market that reported revenue of  million up  compared with last year’s fourth quarter driven by growth from g and next generation datacenter technologies offset by continued softness in the broader communications ecosystem cgs also includes our aerospace defense and government end markets which generated revenue of  million in q compared with  million in the same quarter last year reflecting ongoing weakness in russia and china this brought total csg revenue for the quarter to  million a  yearoveryear decrease or  on a core basis csg reported gross margin of  and operating margin of  our electronic industrial solutions group or eisg generated fourth quarter revenue of  million up  from last year or down  on a core basis driven by ongoing weakness for general electronic solutions particularly in europe which was partially offset by strong growth for leading edge semiconductor process technologies and our automotive applications eisg reported gross margin of  and operating margin of  lastly the services solutions group or ssg generated record revenue of  million in q a  yearoveryear increase or  on a core basis revenue growth for ssg was driven by an increase in sales for our remarketed solutions excluding the impact of three year warranty program revenue for this segment grew  ssg reported gross margin of  and operating margin at  as ron highlighted overall we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the  fiscal year we achieved  order growth and  revenue growth as we navigated a challenging market environment and remain focused on the growth areas of our market revenue for the year totaled  billion and gross margin improved  basis points to  to fuel innovation and strength our market position in strategic areas we continued to invest in research and development which grew by  at the same time we remained within our operating model delivering  operating margin and reporting nongaap net income after tax of  million or  per share moving to the balance sheet and cash flow we ended our fiscal year  with  million in cash and cash equivalents up  million when compared with  million at the end of fiscal  we generated  million in cash flow from operations for the year and consistent with our plan we invested  million in capital purchases this brings our free cash flow for the year to  million or  of revenue an improvement of  basis points compared to last year as we are entering fiscal year  please note a few items for modeling purposes annual salary increases are effective december   additionally as we mentioned last year cash flow is seasonally lower in q due to the payout of variable compensation other operating income is projected to be  million in fy interest expense for the year is expected to be  million pension and benefit expense for the year is projected to increase by approximately  million while cash contributions to our global pension plans are expected to be in line with  lastly we are committed to continue to opportunistically deploy capital through our share repurchase authorization but are assuming a base case diluted share count of  million shares at year end we remain committed to investing in the key growth areas of our markets to drive the long term growth of our business while at the same time staying consistent with our operating model as a reminder our operating model is structured to deliver high teens operating margins at current revenue levels turning to our outlook and guidance for the first quarter as ron noted we are encouraged by the strong order growth we saw in the fourth quarter and while we are seeing increased investment in the development of next generation technologies we continue to expect headwinds in the broader communications market balancing these factors we currently expect q revenue to be in the range of  million to  million with the midpoint in line with the first quarter of last year but on a core basis representing a decline of  with the difference entirely due to currency we expect first quarter nongaap earnings per share to be in the range of  to  or  at the midpoint based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately  million shares with that i will now turn it back to jason for the qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from richard eastman with robert w baird richard eastman just a couple of questions let me just kind of start with the aerospace defense piece of the comm solutions group could you kind of just walk through a little bit on the quarter how did the us business do in ad and any positive vibes here going forward maybe from an order perspective or anything from a front log perspective that suggest that the ad business can be up low single digits or midsingle digits as we work our way through ’ ronald nersesian i’m going to turn it over to mike gasparian the other question that comes up is whether or not we see any change in aerospace defense spending based on the election results and our take is that aerospace defense spending will increase based on the us election results i’ll turn it over to mike who will tell you a little bit more about some of the questions you asked mike gasparian our view on aerospace defense is we still view it as a very stable segment going forward we clearly have pockets of weakness in russia and china which mark wallace will make some comments on when i’m done but that’s offset by some really good growth opportunities in some of the other areas you asked for some color in the americas we have a really nice systems business as well as a great service opportunity with the prime contractors both the systems and the services play into the outsourcing trend that i’ve talked about before so those are good opportunities for the company western europe and india both have good opportunities for services as well then we’ve got radarsatellite segments within those regions that are performing well mark do you want to maybe add some color about what we’re seeing in china and russia mark wallace in russia spending declined in q as demand remained soft during the quarter we saw some delays to some deals and some budgets and it’s really all based on what we’ve seen for a while it’s the us and european sanctions low commodity pricing weak currency just altogether continue to make the environment challenging it’s again important to note that this is not a change from what we saw previously then in china it’s different it’s a weak government spending as we expected as we’re in the early part of china’s five year planning cycle so this is kind of normal seasonality as part of that process richard eastman just a follow up question the other piece on the comm’s solutions business i think you highlighted datacenter spend optical spend as being higher in the quarter even with that the commercial coms business kind of outperformed our expectations how do you view this business going forward you commented we’ll still see headwinds here on the more traditional lte and g side but again do you start to look at this business as stable with upside potential or stable with maybe still downside exposure how do you look at this overall collection of products and markets here geographically as well as by product for commercial comms going forward ronald nersesian i’ll make a general worldwide comment and then i’ll turn it over to mike for a little bit more of the detailed color but we don’t see any specific catalyst at this point budgets outside of leading edge technologies remains weak but we do of course see increased spending and focus on leading edge technologies such as g we’ve been focused on that and we’ve brought a lot of new solutions to market and as a matter of fact we mentioned really leap frogging the competition with our  gigahertz spectrum analyzer or signal analyzer so the story remains the same we see leading edge technologies where money is being spent we see it being pulled in a little bit on g and we’re strong there but outside of that we see things being weak such as g spending we certainly have seen a roll off in that over the year mike gasparian i’ll just add a little bit to ron’s response the whole wireless ecosystem just across the board has kind of a weak characteristic we’re between g and g so kind of dealing with the trough right now it almost doesn’t matter if you look at component suppliers chipset companies device makers operator test labs all of them are dealing with bringing some equilibrium to their supply chains consolidation and restructuring and so the net effect of all of that is a very restrained capex environment we do see i would characterize it as some wide variations from companytocompany but across the board despite these headwinds the leading companies continue to make investments in rd in these next generation technologies so ron highlighted g all the wireless lan areas  ad ay ax  gigabyte those are all big good growth areas for us going forward and i think we’re well positioned to capitalize on all those trends ronald nersesian i’ll add if you take a look at our growth rate versus the competition you can see that we’ll feel very good about our ability to gain share and our market position is much stronger than it was a year or two ago operator the next question comes from brian yuen with deutsch bank brian yuen i’m curious to get your view on what you think the most important demand drivers for  would be i know you have a lot going on with growth autos g module and cloud so how should we sort of think about all these things coming together to impact topline from a modeling perspective in  ronald nersesian we believe that we’re very well positioned in some of the high growth environments in particular we see more investment in rd than we see in manufacturing and our strategy for years has been to really focus on rd where we see higher margins and more stability in the business the other thing is it really plays to our strength of being a leading edge technology player so as we bring out leading edge technologies that no one else can match that gives us a real advantage in being able to grow and to gain market share the biggest thing that we see is g there is no doubt about it that g has a very very broad coverage all up and down throughout the communications ecosystem and it’s been playing very well for us the other thing that’s a growth initiative that it’s not so much a market issue is services we have had a focus on services and this past quarter we had very strong order growth and we also for the year had  order growth for services in our service business we’ve had many successes that in our multivendor calibration service business so overall g is one very very big effort i’ve already mentioned aerospace defense where with the new administration we anticipate there being a ramp up although it will be probably slow in the beginning to the aerospace defense business and then on top of it our competitiveness not only in g but across our electronic industrial market and our services business but we do remain cautious on the overall market outlook because you can look at the rest of the players in the industry and some of the customers that we serve how their business are going but again we have been focusing on the part that has been growing the most which is the rd environment for leading edge technologies brian yuen maybe a quick follow up on the product roadmap you noted the  automotive design wins the  gigahertz spectrum analyzer and g so for  do you have any early indications of what products might be rolling out to address those growth areas anything you might be working on now or have plans to roll out in  ronald nersesian we don’t comment on the future roadmap if there is something that we want to comment on we would go ahead and put it in a press release such as we announced previously that our breakthrough in high performance digital oscilloscope technology in getting to the  gigahertz mark with very very strong signal integrity and high performance so that is one thing that we’ve commented on but other things we won’t comment on but we feel very good about our solutions roadmap and their increased market position we really see that we have gained share from the competition and from our efforts that are really starting to just take stride we see over the next couple of years being able to create some moment operator the next question comes from patrick newton with stifel nicolaus patrick newton given that you’re well positioned to grow above the industry and you seem very confident in share gains the key question seems to be what are your thoughts on the industry growth potential in fy and just given the choppy growth for the industry in general do you anticipate collectively there will be growth in the industry next year mike gasparian as ron just said we still remain cautious about the overall market outlook looking forward clearly we’re seeing acceleration in next generation technologies but there are other portions of the market that continue to remain under pressure i think the important thing for us is that we have a business and an operating model that enables us to perform and delivery some profitability and cash flow under any market conditions we’re going to continue to be cautious continue to execute on our plan continue to transform our investments if you will continue making investments in rd and in the field to capture future growth we’re funding those investments through increased efficiencies in our factories through improved gross margins our gross margins were up  basis points this year and increased efficiency in our administrative functions as well ’ these markets are notoriously difficult to call we see no specific catalyst at this point and remain cautious as we enter  patrick newton i’m just trying to understand the guidance a little bit you have bookings up almost  million yearoveryear but the midpoint of the guidance matches revenue from fiscal q last year i guess after a soft bookings quarter in q is this kind of a backlog refill is there any change into maybe the timing of deliveries that’s embedded in the bookings or backlog or any reason why we wouldn’t see a higher midpoint in the guidance ronald nersesian first of all you’re largely correct we saw good bookings here in q but had been in a relatively softer backlog position entering the quarter so first of all we keep the exact same process going into q as we have used previously we look at our existing backlog that backlog is scheduled out from a shipment perspective so we know what portion of our backlog is shippable in q we then look at our order funnel and make some assumptions about how incoming orders are going to convert to revenue within the quarter the one other factor which is a change from this year in fiscal  chinese new year fell at the beginning of q which quite frankly is a little bit better timing from a business perspective than where it falls here in fy at the very tail end of our q so we’ve certainly factored that in to our guidance although i will say it is another factor that impacts predictability for the quarter so we’re highly confident in our ability to fall within our range but that timing of chinese new year depending on how shipments move there’s very little time to recover if things happen differently than we’ve modeled them patrick newton on modular i think you gave us the data point that you had double digit growth in orders for both the axl and pxl side of the business i’m just curious i think you gave us a data point last year of kind of where your analyzed orders were and any update you can give us currently ronald nersesian we’re not giving any new specific guidance or i would say information except that yearoveryear we did see double digit order and revenue growth for modular patrick newton anite is fully integrated i would just love your thoughts on your appetite for ma or if you’re more focused now on more organic initiatives ronald nersesian we have a blend there’s no doubt that what we’re doing is we’re focusing on getting our organic growth up like we mentioned at the end of last year and that continues to be a real focus for us we’re doing that obviously by shifting more of our expense to rd and to direct feet on the street to sell and we’re very pleased with our progress but also we’re looking at market segments that are adjacent that could actually be something where we could create value for our shareholders and increase our overall growth rate so we’re looking at both organic and inorganic but roic is clearly one very very strong measure that use to make sure that we can get a great return on anything we do that’s inorganic operator the next question comes from brandon couillard with jefferies brandon couillard i’m just curious in general are you satisfied are you happy with the returns you’re seeing on the stepped up rd investment and at this point do you have any appetite to perhaps take that another  basis points further ronald nersesian we’re very very pleased with the progress that we’re making and again as you know when you invest in rd sometimes it’s a  to  month investment before the product even hits the market and then a product ramps from there and has to go through a customer’s buying cycle so you don’t always see it in the quarter or even the fiscal year in the actual result but we are very pleased with the path that we’re on and the results that we’re getting in at this point as far as taking it further right now we’ll be talking a little bit more about modeling but we are slowly making sure that we can get the right returns on the investments that we have before we’re going ahead and trying to invest even more heavily neil dougherty let me make a couple of extra comments we’re very pleased with the results that we’re getting from our rd and the positioning that we’re having in the leading edge technologies referencing again g and our relative position in g relative to where we were in prior generation so i think you will continue to see us make investments for growth both in rd and in the field and as we’ve said previously we look to fund those investments in the current revenue levels through efficiencies elsewhere in the pl reminding you the business model is set up to deliver high teen s operating margins at current revenue levels we’re investing in rd in the field to drive growth when markets recover and we can get this business growing at a  sustained rate we can deliver our  incremental when we get to those growth rates right now it’s about transitioning the investments we’re making to be more growth oriented so that when markets recover we’re positioned to capture them ronald nersesian as you look at our year numbers we delivered  operating margin while increasing our rd spend by going ahead and being more efficient in our manufacturing by increasing our gross margin as well making other tradeoffs in the opex lines brandon couillard in the fourth quarter revenues came in at the high end of the range eps more towards the midpoint low end was that just a surprise on the mix in gross margins then did you say  million of other operating income in fiscal  and what exactly is that tied to is that agilent related neil dougherty first all with regard to kind of revenue in q coming in at the high end of the range and eps more in the middle really there were two factors that fully explain that one was product mix we’ve been working on kind of a long term trend to increase the proportion of our business that comes from rd versus manufacturing solutions and that’s still a trend line that we’re comfortably on but relative to the past couple of quarters our mix in q of manufacturing based solutions was slightly higher and that drove a lower overall gross margin then the second thing was a direct result of the higher order levels obviously our commissions climb with the higher order levels and that obviously will yield a benefit in coming quarters the second part of the question was with regard to other income and yes that is a direct relation to the kind of the landlord tenant relationship that exists with agilent where we essentially own facilities and are leasing space back to our prior parent operator that concludes our question and answer session for today i would like to turn the conference back to jason kary jason kary thank you all for joining us today we look forward

solutions into our aerospace and defense market we plan to meet many of our joint anite and keysight customers at mobile world congress where we will be also showcasing anites recently launched virtual drive testing toolset that was already selected by a major mobile operator in china to verify mobile device performance in highspeed train scenarios and lastly looking at our services initiative we continue to secure new business in north america and europe with our multivendor calibration and asset management capabilities when adjusted to exclude the impact of the threeyear warranty program and currency our services revenue grew  yearoveryear we are partnering with our customers to create value and help them manage assets and costs for example we recently worked with an aerospace and defense customer to measurably improve the use of their assets reduce test time and increase yields – all in an effort to reduce test and design engineering and capital equipment expense our services plan included test system integration test flow consulting and instrument and system level software functionality and while we provided great value in helping this customer reduce their overall design expenses their spending with keysight more than tripled yearoveryear moving on to our markets as we discussed in november we expected macro factors to suppress first half market growth while orders tracked to our expectations for the majority of the quarter we saw a significant slowdown in january as weakening macro factors in the broader markets negatively impact sentiment towards capital expense purchases this effected order patterns across our end markets with the most notable pullback in communications where our wireless supply chain customers paused spending following lowered estimates for wireless component and smartphone shipments as a result first quarter orders were down  yearoveryear and this is reflected in our second quarter guidance which neil will discuss in more detail while we continue to see continued market softness in the near term we remain committed to delivering profit within our operating model and at the same time investing in our growth initiatives we believe keysight is well positioned to grow when the market stabilizes and customers reaccelerate capital investments the progress we made on our growth initiatives in the first quarter demonstrates that we are investing in the right areas and are creating value for our customers and partners by bringing leading edge solutions and services to market while strategic ma remains our priority use of cash the  million share repurchase program we announced today reflects our confidence in our strategy and our ability to achieve above market growth in the longterm now i will turn the call over to neil to provide more details on our q financial results as well as our secondquarter guidance neil p dougherty  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you ron and hello everyone today we reported first quarter total nongaap revenue of  million that was above the midpoint of our guidance on a yearoveryear basis this represents  growth on a core basis which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions revenue declined  yearoveryear in line with our expectations gaap revenue for the quarter was  million which excludes certain accounting adjustments associated with revaluing preacquisition deferred revenue from anite looking at our top line performance by end market communications revenue grew  yearoveryear including revenue from anite excluding anite communications revenue decreased in the low doubledigit range yearoveryear as restructuring and consolidation activities impacted spending patterns and softness from customers in the smartphone supply chain outweighed growth in lteadvanced and g technology revenue from aerospace and defense was  million a decline of  million or  from last years first quarter which was the high point for  growth in the us for our aerospace and defense solutions was offset by continued softness in europe and asia first quarter industrial computer and semiconductor revenue grew  driven by strong sales from our instrument and parametric test products and next generation processor testing regionally and on a core basis revenue was flat in the americas up  in europe and grew  in japan revenue in asia excluding japan declined  the regional mix of total revenue was  from the americas  from europe and  from asia our first quarter operational results were strong with gross margin increasing to  a  basis point improvement yearoveryear as a result of a higher percentage of software and rd revenue expenses were wellmanaged while we continued to invest in rd programs in support of our growth initiatives operating expenses totaled  million including the first full quarter of anite spending operating margin was   in line with the prior year our industryleading margins result from our continued operational discipline and the proactive management of our cost structure across the cycle nongaap net income after taxes was  million or  per share which was above the midpoint of our guidance range moving to the results of our two operating segments measurement solutions generated first quarter revenue of  million an increase of  including revenue from anite operating margin for measurement solutions was  the customer support and services segment generated revenue of  million in q up  on a core basis with an operating margin of  as a reminder the services business has a higher fixed cost structure when compared to our measurement solutions business the q cost structure also reflects the investments we are making in additional capacity to expand our multivendor calibration and asset management services moving to the balance sheet and cash flow we ended the quarter with  million in cash and cash equivalents of which approximately  is located offshore in the quarter we generated  million in cash flow from operations as i mentioned last quarter cash flow is seasonally lower in q due to the payout of variable compensation in addition we had higher capital purchases this quarter totaling  million which brought our free cash flow to  million as ron mentioned our board has authorized a share repurchase program of up to  million the new repurchase program goes into effect immediately and shares may be purchased from time to time the program will be funded from current and future cash flows and is consistent with our phased approach to return of capital while we remain focused on identifying ma opportunities that will help us achieve our growth objectives this repurchase authorization reflects our confidence in our growth opportunities and strong cash flow generation turning to our outlook and guidance for the second quarter taking into account our order performance in the first quarter and the broader market sentiment we expect q nongaap revenue to be in the range of  million to  million which at the midpoint reflects a  decline or  on a core basis with our ongoing attention to cost management and the leverage and flexibility of our operating model we expect to deliver operating profit in the highteens while continuing to invest in the growth areas of our business balancing these factors we expect second quarter nongaap earnings per share to be in the range of  to  and our weighted diluted share count to be approximately  million shares with that i will now turn it back to jason for the qa jason a kary  treasurer investor relations  vice president thank you neil tracy will you please give the instructions for the qa questionandanswer session operator and your first question comes from the line of richard eastman from robert w baird your line is open richard eastman  robert w baird  co inc broker okay yes ron could you maybe speak a little bit to the communications business and excluding anite which looks like it came in from a revenue standpoint about as expected just speak to the core decline in communications i think math suggests maybe around  just a little bit of color on the pieces there and maybe on the order side how did orders fare in the quarter for the comm business ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director sure rick ill turn this over to mike gasparian who leads that business but let me make a couple of comments youre right on a core basis we were down  there are a couple things that are going on in the industry first there is consolidation of some players theres restructuring also and both of those things lead to a rationalization of spending on top of that youve heard about some of the contraction in the smartphone supply chain thats going on from some big players so thats the macro picture of whats going on in the market overall our strategy has been and its been a multiyear strategy and we continue to make progress on it is to move from wireless manufacturing to more of our business in wireless rd wireless rd has higher gross margins it is a business that is more differentiated than manufacturing and is less cyclical or has less volatility than manufacturing and im glad to report that our wireless rd business is bigger than our wireless manufacturing business now by a good bit and well continue to move towards a larger and larger percentage of our business being in wireless rd with anite being added our wireless rd business with anite grew our wireless manufacturing business contracted and our other communications which leads really into a lot of the fiber and a lot of the backhaul communications also grew on a revenue basis so with that ill turn it over to mike for a few comments michael c gasparian  senior vice president and president communications solutions group yeah let me just add little color to that i think ron outlining a number of shortterm factors that will put the communications market under pressure nevertheless we believe there are still excellent longterm growth opportunities in the communications segment people will continue to invest in the evolution as we go from g to g there will be many points at which well get additional investments and then were seeing a really good uptick in the g research space our g orders have doubled in this most recent quarter its still on a small base but it does reflect a number of engagements we have with research institutions around the world and we have delivered a number of very unique solutions which will be showcasing at mobile world congress next week where several of us will be there interacting with our key customers ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director and one other comment a question that you asked rick was how our orders in the communications sector with anite our orders were up slightly in total so our comps business is up slightly but that includes an acquisition richard eastman  robert w baird  co inc broker okay and just maybe ron one other thought on the modular test side again good doubledigit growth is the growth coming heavily or is the growth heavily slanted towards the communications business  ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director yes the communications business is one significant part plus also if you look at not only wireless rd in general but what we call other communications were seeing a lot digital applications move over to modular so we have both of those areas or both of those subgroups in communications that are moving but as we expand our portfolio youll see more and more solutions in the industrial space too which will allow us to make some traction against some competitors richard eastman  robert w baird  co inc broker okay very good thank you ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director youre welcome thanks rick operator your next question comes from the line of brandon couillard with jefferies your line is now open brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks good afternoon ron just sort of a big picture question for you youve been with this business obviously a long time been through several cycles over the past decade or so how do you view the macro environment today relative to lets say the past few cycles in terms of demand picture and whats different today versus what this business was like ala  or prior ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director sure i have seen many cycles over the last  years this one is pretty typical and to be very honest we dont have very good visibility on this cycle theres a lot of things that are being created from the overall macro environment of the markets which is causing folks to hold on to their wallet but let me give you some color commentary on to what happened this quarter our orders were tracking to expectations right through mid january and as you know a lot of the compares that you see they report results or have reported results through december but in january in the middle of january we saw a market slowdown in our incoming orders and thats not inconsistent of what youve seen from some other larger players in the overall electronics markets this macro uncertainty that is there has caused people to pull back on capex and has caused customers to be much more cautious so if you look at that if your revenue growth for the quarter was  but if you look at our order growth it was minus  but on a core basis it was minus  and given this macro uncertainty its probable that the  market growth that we saw before this real lets say disconnect in january will probably not play out now what were doing about it is were taking action we have an operating model because we know our business has some cyclicality and this model allows us to deliver strong cash flow and solid doubledigit operating margin throughout the cycle and as you see and as neil mentioned in his script even in q were planning to deliver upper teens operating margin and this is all why – while we continue to invest in growth and continue with our strong rd programs in modular software wireless and services and were getting great traction on all of those fronts so bringing it back this cycle is not that untypical i think when the markets stabilize you may see some performance begin to return so little unclear how quickly it will return but again were talking about minus  core revenue growth in q brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks thats helpful and just to be clear do you have a revised market growth outlook for the year and would that be simply a function of comms and do i understand your comments that suggests that ics and the aerospace and defense orders actually held up pretty well through january neil p dougherty  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah we dont have a revised market forecast for the full year actually wed expect with the kind of inflection point that we saw in orders in midjanuary our visibility out beyond really beyond more than one quarter is increasingly limited and so its very difficult to call i think as ron said its highly unlikely at this point that we see  growth but we do not have an updated forecast based on the  order decline the core order decline that we saw in q ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director and when we see some of these big macro cycles and while we continue to generate great cash sometimes it provides great opportunities for us to create value for our shareholders by doing share repurchase programs weve talked in the past about still number one our priority is to fund strategic ma but we will be opportunistic when we can create value for our shareholders with buybacks such as were doing right now so i really believe we know how  to manage this business through the cycles to deliver profitability and to create shareholder value for the long term brandon couillard  jefferies llc super and then one more for neil just on the capex side was there something onetime in the frontend loading in the first quarter and do you have a target that we should expect for the full year neil p dougherty  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah i wouldnt read more into that than it should some of the equipment that we buy is longer lead time and the actual cash flowing is a function of acceptance and installation and the rest but we still intend to manage our overall capex budget to the year to the same  million to  million range that we put out in the past and so just a little bit of a timing difference caused that to be more frontend loaded this year brandon couillard  jefferies llc super thank you ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director thanks brandon operator your next question comes from the line of patrick newton from stifel your line is now open patrick newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah good afternoon ron and neil thank you for taking my questions im sorry if missed this in the prepared remarks but just kind of looking at the customer support and services gross margin below  for the first time in our historical model im curious if you could talk through some of the impacts and maybe the duration of some of the pressures there neil p dougherty  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah happy to do that if you think about our services business its a higher fixed cost business when you compare it to the rest of keysight as you can see our q revenue was – were down in that segment but thats as compared to kind of the run rates over the second half of last year they were flat to q but compared to the second half when profitability was much higher revenues were down but youll notice that the costs in that business are very stable as we noted in prior quarters were still navigating through a change in our standard warranty from one year to three years and that impacted the sale of extended warranties in that business and were still essentially working through the impact to deferred revenue were losing about  million per quarter in deferred revenue as those previously sold extended warranties work their way through our pl this quarter incidentally will be the last quarter and well be through that although itll still be in our compares for remaining year but the underlying growth rate of the business is strong we mentioned the  growth rate if you adjust for that warranty impact and for currency and were confident that the profitability of that business will be in the upper teens over the longer term as were continuing to make investments to grow that business particularly in the areas of multivendor calibration and asset management patrick newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc great okay and then just a few modular questions for you i guess just given the doubledigit growth that youre seeing in modular in the face of macro headwinds that are hitting the rest of the business is this growth stemming from the broadening of your portfolio is it stemming from share gains or conversely do you think that its having a negative impact or perhaps cannibalizing the rest of your business and then could you also remind us the relative size of your modular business currently ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director sure first of all i think its a mix some of the products that were selling were products that were sold in the past in our featurerich boxes but a lot of it is also incremental there are customers that want modular solutions for some reasons why it is a distinct advantage and we continue to win that business against the competition our business we talked about last year at investor day about being approximately  million of our new modular products and we talked about that in september and we did achieve or beat the  million last year and this year were just saying weve grown  from q neil p dougherty  chief financial officer  senior vice president the  is not a modular growth we grew – that we grew double digits ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director yes patrick newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc and then just this last one if i may is on the rd side you talked several times in the prepared remarks about a continued focus on investing in rd and still maintaining that solid teens op margin even through this challenged time but im curious now with you being a standalone company for over a year is the  rd target still the right number is that still the right way to think about it i think that some would argue that on an absolute basis is a very aggressive rd spend and more than enough while others would argue that as a percentage of revenue youre still running well below peers so any thoughts around is  the right way to think about rd ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director were looking at what does it take to win in the marketplace and what do we need to do to accomplish our strategy we spent  in the past we up that to  last year and clearly as the top line moves around you will see that percentage vary there is no doubt that on a total basis were spending less than the competition on average but we do have some economies of scale from having our own for instance internal fab that can go ahead and provide products and solutions to multiple businesses and multiple product lines as far as the rd percentage were going to monitor that with regards to our ability to go ahead and to win in these marketplaces but i think its directionally correct patrick newton  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thank you for taking my questions good luck ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director sure operator and your next question comes from the line of vijay bhagavath with deutsche bank your line is now open anjaya shrestha  deutsche bank securities inc hi can you guys hear me ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director yeah hi vijay neil p dougherty  chief financial officer  senior vice president hi anjaya shrestha  deutsche bank securities inc hi this is aj shrestha in actually for vijay bhagavath just had two questions really the first one was trying to get your thoughts on the product mix for the rest of the year should we expect a higher percentage in software mix and the other one is the opex how should we think about that for the rest of the year ronald s nersesian  president chief executive officer  director yeah so let me try and address those questions i think we are making a concerted effort over time to shift the mix of our business towards more rd solutions and more software but if you put that in the scale of the rest of the year our markets – our markets dont move that quickly youre not going to see fundamental shifts in our mix based on those efforts over that short of period of time its a bit more of a methodical slog than that with regard to our opex again well be working hard to manage our spending as we move through this economic cycle but our q results now reflect a full quarter of anite spending and you could view those as representative of what we expect for the remaining quarters of the year anjaya shrestha  deutsche bank securities inc got it okay appreciate it guys operator thank you that was our last question that concludes our questionandanswer session for today i would like to the turn the conference back to jason
