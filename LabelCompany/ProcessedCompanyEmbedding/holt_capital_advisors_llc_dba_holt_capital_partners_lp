impartial advice  in addition we believe that it is important to invest our assets along with our clients  in this regard the firm’s founder has significant assets invested in all three strategies  other examples of coinvestment include private equity investment opportunities in which the firm’s founder and clients have invested on identical terms        holt capital partners lp     our firm manages client assets utilizing one or more of our five investment strategies  we work  with clients in order to develop investment guidelines create an asset allocation and implement an investment strategy to achieve their specific longterm risk and return objectives  client assets can be structured across a range of strategies from traditional actively managed equity or fixed income portfolios to cost effective passive investment strategies  the firm’s strategies are all available as separately managed portfolios  active indexingan asset allocation strategy that is implemented across domestic equities international equities or fixed income securities  the strategy utilizes exchangetraded funds to position portfolios for superior performance  the same proprietary growth and value models that are used to identify individual stocks in the large cap strategy are utilized to build the appropriate asset allocation at the index levelour fixed income strategy emphasizes short and intermediate maturities in order to reduce price volatility  portfolios include investment grade and below investment grade securities depending upon individual client objectivesdividend yieldour firms dividend yield strategy is designed to provide broadly diversified and cost efficient exposure to quality companies with high and rising dividend yields  these portfolios tend to exhibit lower price volatility than the sp  index  the investment process utilizes the firms proprietary growth and value models in order to identify the most attractive sources of dividend income in the equity market  the implementation process is typically focused on low cost tax efficient exchangetraded fundslarge cap growth and valuea large cap investment strategy that utilizes our proprietary quantitative growth and value models  it is designed to be a core holding for investors with an sp  benchmark  the growth strategy identifies companies with strong growth characteristics and the value strategy focuses on stocks that are selling at historically low valuations  the diversification of two distinct strategies as well as positions in approximately  different stocks reduces the price volatility ie risk of the portfoliovalue equitythe investment objective of the value equity strategy is longterm capital appreciation with a moderate level of risk  the strategy seeks to identify companies that are undervalued as a result of temporary factors that create negative investor sentiment  we base our decision process on a three to five year investment horizon which enables us to focus on the valuation of a business in relation to its longterm fundamentalsinflation hedgethe objective of this strategy is to provide longterm returns in excess of the cpi with strong relative performance during periods of rising inflation  this strategy is implemented through a concentrated portfolio of publicly traded securities with significant ownership of real estate timberland oil and

allocation manager performance investment expenses and tax efficiency  if our analysis leads to the restructuring of a client’s portfolio we can implement the necessary changes with passive investment strategies or through the selection and evaluation of active managers  our manager search process seeks to identify firms that are in the investment management profession rather than the business of
