demonstrate some level of actual market validation early stage companies with exceptional technology or other proprietary advantages that are poised to capitalize on major market trends later stage middle market buyout opportunities that are attractively priced and offer upside growth potential through strategy modification and management rejuvenation our target investment size is    million with additional funds reserved for followon rounds we have an investment capacity of up to  million per company investment focus areas we target the following four investment focus areas that we believe offer attractive upside potential and where we have substantial investment experience and market expertise information and communications technology ict – ict encompasses areas that are being transformed by the convergence of highperformance computing global highspeed telecommunications and advanced sensing and data analysis some example investment areas within ict are as follows network hardware and software wireless communications distributed computing and interoperable webbased services rich media creation and distribution infrastructure life sciences – we focus on areas within life sciences that can capitalize on major market demographic trends have relatively lower gotomarket hurdles and possess multiple large active strategic buyers some example investment areas are as follows medical devices for therapeutic uses novel diagnostics and imaging specialty pharmaceuticals drug delivery services – we look for service businesses that are well positioned to capitalize on outsourcing trends and efficiencies being created by rapid advances in it and telecommunications technologies example investment areas are as follows financial services health care services information technology services medical services defense and security – we target investments that are poised to capitalize on longterm growth trends in the defense and security arenas some example investment areas are as follows surveillance and monitoring flexible rapid deployment communications technologies for military and emergency situations software for operationally intensive environments data archiving search and retrieval we are willing to consider investments outside these four focus areas on a limited basis however they must offer an exceptionally compelling investment thesis back to top what we look for in a company a large market opportunity we look for companies with a market opportunity that is large enough to provide ample room for growth over several years in addition we are particularly attracted to companies that have positioned their products or services to capitalize on major structural changes within their target markets a clear sustainable competitive advantage a company must be able to articulate a simple clear business plan that explains why it will be a winner and how it can sustain a winning position over an extended period of time we look for sources of competitive advantage based on unique market position a novel competitive strategy specialized expertise patents trade secrets or similar stellar management we believe strongly that even a great idea has little value unless there is a great management team to turn it into reality we look for experienced management that has domain expertise in the company’s business area a track record of prior success and the drive and passion needed to overcome the many inevitable obstacles on the road to success an attractive financial model we expect a company’s management to provide an attractive but realistic financial model that shows how it will make money how much capital it will need and how value will be created for investors we look for businesses that can deliver strong margins have low to medium capital intensity and a high degree of financial and operational scalability high exit potential in evaluating any investment we carefully consider the available avenues for the company to achieve a successful exit we are attracted to investment areas where strong valuations exist for comparable public and private companies we also look at the history of ma activity in the specific investment area and the number and quality of potential acquirers finally we also prefer to see that a company is addressing a large enough market opportunity to make a future
