zynga made social gaming and play a worldwide phenomenon and we remain the industry leader mark pincus leader play gaming i think we live in a unique time  the verbs that make up our online and mobile lives havent been completely invented or imagined for us that was kind of a life path i was on mark pincus life time path clearly as you move to being a public company probably even more than growth there is a huge value based on predictability mark pincus growth value you there are people who want the comfort and structure of a job where theyre given tasks and told what to do i think its actually a minority of people the majority of people dont want that but id say that the companies ive built are full of people with something to prove mark pincus job comfort people my approach is that you have to earn the respect of people you work with mark pincus work respect people from the beginning i wanted to build a company that could sustain not for two years or four years or even ten years but be something that really matters over time the way amazon and google and others have mark pincus time beginning matters i need to aspire to be a great ceo and not just a great product
