continues to increase across all age groups this population has access to conventional medications with significant polypharmacy observed in older adults thus the safety of the interactions between multiingredient nps and drugs is a topic of paramount importance considerations such ashistory of safe use literature data from animal toxicity and human clinical studies and np constituent characterization would provide guidance on whether to assess npdrug interactions experimentally the literature is replete with reports of various np extracts and constituents as potent inhibitors of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters however without standard methods for np characterization or in vitro testing extrapolating these reports to clinicallyrelevant npdrug interactions is

approachstarting march herbal product usage in the north american population continues to increase across all age groups this population has ready access to conventional medications with significant polypharmacy observed in older adults patients are reticent to disclose herbal product usage to their healthcare providers and many providers still do not inquire about such usage dietary supplements including herbal products are not subject to the same regulatory guidelines for premarket testing as drugs considerations such as history of safe use literature data from toxicity studies and constituent amounts in products may provide guidance on whether to assess hdis experimentally the literature is replete with reports of various herbal extracts and constituents as potent inhibitors of

clinicallyrelevant hdis is difficult this lack of a clear definition of risk prevents clinicians and consumers from making informed decisions about the safety of taking herbal products with conventional medications a logical strategy is to borrow as applicable from the testing guidances for assessing drugdrug interactions established by regulatory agencies eg fda ema for example intestinal and hepatic in vitro systems can be used to assess potential hdis these data can be incorporated into pbpk models to help determine clinical relevance in summary a framework is needed that

   tweet nascar ceo brian france spent nearly five years battling two charlotte media outlets to keep details of a recent divorce sealed the lengthy dispute prompted many across the motorsports world to wonder just what he was trying to keep from the public eye   france speaking to the media left and with former wife megan in  photo by getty images  the answer which came last week after the north carolina supreme court unsealed the documents was next to nothing the only thing eyeopening in the roughly  pages of documents was that there was nothing unusual just specifics of his wealth which was already wellknown and details of a conventionally contentious divorce case and the motorsports world responded with a shrug “any time you seal anything you create great curiosity in the public and it’s even greater the closer you get to the person” said humpy wheeler the former longtime president of speedway motorsports inc and charlotte motor speedway “i’m just glad there wasn’t anything in there and i didn’t think there was going to be that defamed anybody” the case which began after france filed for a divorce in  turned out to be more indicative of his personality than damaging to his reputation like his father he is known for wanting things his way and he wanted to keep the documents sealed so he paid his charlottebased legal team at horack talley to take the case to the highest court in the state in doing so the only thing he had to lose was money “most people do not want their dirty laundry in public but not a lot of people have the finances to argue about it and take it to the supreme court” said alan krusch a family law attorney in charlotte “if money is not an issue and you have the time and inclination you can litigate a lot of things” inside the case records information that was part of the divorce record that nascar chairman  ceo brian france fought for four years to keep private net worth as of september  equity  loans  total assets   a footnote to his  financial statements stated “brian is likely to inherit substantial wealth from his parents which as of the date hereof may be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and could exceed  billion”

confirmed that france has more than enough wealth to litigate anything he chooses his total assets topped  million in  and his total income from nascar in  was  million according to financial documents released see chart by comparison in  thennfl commissioner paul tagliabue made  million and mlb commissioner bud selig made  million in addition to revealing dated details of france’s income and net worth the documents detailed property and assets owned in  including ownership of  homes valued at  million eight cars valued at  three airplanes valued at  million an foot yacht valued at  million  million in investments and  million in international speedway corp stock a  financial statement added “brian is likely to inherit substantial wealth from his parents which as of the date hereof may be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and could exceed  billion” wheeler said that none of that came as a surprise but it did make people who worked in the nascar industry over the last  years happy “there was a day when you couldn’t hardly scrape a dime together in this business” wheeler said “i remember going fishing with both his grandfather and father wondering if i was going to get back to shore because i didn’t trust the boats they were in now he’s got an foot yacht i know that will get back to shore” france married his second wife megan divorced remarried her and divorced again between  and  following the  divorce the couple went to court over alimony and child care disputes according to their prenuptial agreement france was to pay megan  million plus  in alimony a month for  years and  a month in child custody that was in addition to the  million award she got after their first divorce france allegedly began withholding alimony in  and the pair wound up in court where france’s attorneys alleged megan was trying to keep the court case open to the public in order to increase the amount of alimony she received his legal team argued the case should remain confidential because there was “no public interest in knowing the business of the france’s other than voyeurism” “we’re just asking you to keep the media jeremy mayfield whoever else wants to peek out of our business” france’s attorney told the judge “who is jeremy mayfield” the judge asked “jeremy mayfield is a nascar driver” france’s attorney said “mr mayfield was permanently suspended by nascar for failing some drug tests … he has filed a federal lawsuit against my client and nascar and lots of other folks” the documents were punctuated by the typical backandforth of a couple in the midst of a divorce megan alleged france threatened to file “a whole lot more lawsuits” against her and hired a private investigator to follow her and among other things dig through her trash france alleged that megan wrote defamatory blog posts about him and he confirmed that nascar’s legal team led by general counsel gary crotty investigated the postings highs and lows france had an eventful decade
