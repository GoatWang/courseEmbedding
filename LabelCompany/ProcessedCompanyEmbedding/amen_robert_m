spect scans harriet hall on march   share thistweetshare on tumblrmorepocketprintemail daniel amen loves spect scans single photon emission computed tomography and well he should they have brought him fame and fortune they have rewarded him with a chain of amen clinics a presence on pbs lucrative speaking engagements a  million mansion overlooking the pacific ocean and a line of products including books videos and diet supplements “nutraceuticals”  he grossed  million last year   amen is a psychiatrist who charges patients  to take pretty colored spect pictures of their brains as an aid to the diagnosis and treatment of conditions including brain trauma attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder adhd addictions anxiety depression dementia and obesity he even does spect scans as a part of marriage counseling and for general brain health checkups spect imaging uses an injected radioisotope to measure blood flow in different areas of the brain amen is exposing patients to radiation and charging them big bucks because his personal experience has convinced him spect is useful so far he has failed to convince the rest of the scientific medical community amen has just published an article in the journal alternative therapies entitled “it’s time to stop flying blind how not looking at the brain leads to missed diagnoses failed treatments and dangerous behaviors”  it amounts to poorlyreasoned apologetics with false analogies testimonials and pretty pictures that don’t prove what he thinks they prove previous criticism i have written about dr amen before both on quackwatch and on sciencebased medicine  amen’s attorneys complained that my quackwatch article was unfair we responded to the attorneys by asking a series of questions and i commented on their inadequate response when you google “daniel amen” “amen clinic” or even just “spect scans” my articles appear early in the list of hits it’s not just me amen has a lot of other critics psychiatrist daniel carlat wrote “brain scans as mind readers don’t believe the hype” in wired magazine describing his own evaluation by dr amen amen told carlat his scans showed too little activity a pattern of angst and a predisposition to depression that part was a slam dunk since in taking a medical history amen had already elicited the information that carlat had had a short bout with depression he recommended a multivitamin gingko less snowboarding and more tennis an expert at ucla later reviewed the same scans and explained that the findings are meaningless because they haven’t been validated by controlled studies to determine their diagnostic specificity carlat likens amen’s spiel to the cold readings of palm readers the skeptic’s dictionary has critiqued amen’s pbs programs calling them “infomercials”  the pbs ombudsman received a flurry of complaints about the use of amen’s videos for fundraising drives but weaseled out of taking any action by saying decisions were made by local stations and the programs were not officially endorsed by pbs neurologist robert burton wrote an article called “brain scam” in salon  the title says it all among other things he is appalled that amen claims to know how to prevent and treat alzheimer’s in an article titled “brain scans not quite ready for prime time” dr thomas insel the director of the national institute for mental health characterizes brain imaging as “still primarily a research tool” he cautions that “entrepreneurial zeal capitalizing on scientific advances needs to be tempered by reality checks” in a  article in the washington post neely tucker reported officials at major psychiatric and neuroscience associations and research centers say his spect claims are no more than myth and poppycock buffaloing an unsuspecting public… the disconnect between amen’s public image and professional reputation among the elite in the field has come to defy logic he includes a number of scathing quotations from those elite amen’s new “flying blind” article anecdotes he starts with an anecdote about his nephew who had attacked a little girl for no apparent reason amen did a spect scan and found a large arachnoid cyst after surgery the violent behavior stopped this is a touching story but anecdotes are not evidence cysts and other brain abnormalities are frequent incidental findings on brain imaging and arachnoid cysts are often asymptomatic even when large  even if the child’s violent behavior was due to the cyst a spect scan was not necessary to find it an mri would have found it with better anatomical detail and no need for radiation exposure he asks how could a child psychiatrist know what was going on in andrew’s brain unless he or she actually looked at how it functioned… psychiatry remains the only medical specialty that rarely looks at the organ it treats he suggests that if the brains of recent mentally ill mass murderers had been looked at their crimes might have been prevented that might be a persuasive argument if “looking at the brain” actually corresponded to understanding what the neurons were doing or had any predictive value it doesn’t he presents more anecdotes after an addict saw the “toxic pattern” on his scan he stopped abusing alcohol and cocaine after a depressed patient’s scan showed a pattern “consistent with brain injury” further questioning led her to remember a fall from her bike a month before her symptoms began defensiveness next he switches into defensive mode trying to answer some of the criticisms that have been leveled against him scans will not give an accurate psychiatric diagnosis he admits this is true but argues that a diagnosis doesn’t tell us if the brain is overactive and needs to be calmed or underactive and needs stimulation he gives another anecdote of a patient with hallucinations spect scanning showed areas of increased activity leading him to investigate further and diagnose lyme disease he says “in my psychiatric group’s experience success rates increase when psychiatrists use clinical histories plus scans” emphasis added remember that mark crislip has called “in my experience” the three most dangerous words in medicine not enough research has occurred he admits that more work is needed but switches into tu quoque mode saying that only  to  of the recommendations of other specialties are supported by alevel scientific evidence scans are expensive he says they cost about the same as mri scans but the cost of an mri varies and only the highest prices correspond to what amen routinely charges for spect and mris are arguably done for reasons that are better grounded in evidence no other psychiatrist routinely orders mris on every patient and mri scans don’t use radiation the scans use radiation  he argues that ct scans do too but ct scans are arguably done for reasons that are better grounded in evidence they are not done routinely on every patient spect is not ready for clinical use and should be left in the hands of researchers he argues that a useful medical procedure should not be withheld from patients just because researchers haven’t chosen to study it and that there are no financial incentives for such research since the imaging tools already exist i don’t think i need to point out what is wrong with that reasoning ignoring the real criticisms he is really responding to a straw man characterization of what his critics have said he ignores other criticisms like these patients should not be subjected to the radiation and expense of a spect scan without credible evidence from controlled peerreviewed studies that it is likely to help them he is relying on experience and anecdote rather than on acceptable scientific evidence he has not validated that scans show what he claims they show he uses unscientific terminology like “your brain is cool at rest” he has not shown that his outcomes are better than those of doctors who do not do spect scans he has created his own idiosyncratic classifications of illness based on scan results classifications that go beyond the dsm and that have not been validated elsewhere for instance he divides adhd into classic inattentive overfocused temporal lobe limbic and “ring of fire” and obesity into compulsive impulsive impulsive convulsive sad and anxious he prescribes inadequately tested natural remedies irrational mixtures of nutritional diet supplements hyperbaric oxygen and other questionable treatments a riff on traumatic brain injuries he goes on to talk about unrecognized damage from traumatic brain injuries recommending that spect scans be routinely used on military personnel and those at risk of sports injuries but he has only his own anecdotal impressions that spect scans can add anything useful to the usual diagnostic process for tbi which already includes ct and mri scans conclusion amen fails to make his case that “not looking at the brain leads to missed diagnoses failed treatments and dangerous behaviors” he accuses conventional doctors of “flying blind” but maybe he is the one flying blind blinded by delusions born of exalting personal experience above rigorous scientific testing and allowing the lure of celebrity and riches to cloud his judgment isn’t it curious that while he claims to be at the cutting edge of scientific medicine this article was

v w x y z amen daniel md note this sd entry is from my blog skeptimedia skeptimedia is a commentary on mass media treatment of issues concerning science the paranormal and the supernatural pbs infomercial for daniel amens clinics it is not possible to definitively determine whether a person is anxious or feeling connected simply by looking at activity in a particular brain region this is so because brain regions are typically engaged by many mental states and thus a onetoone mapping between a brain region and a mental state is not possible the notion that we can use cortical maps to improve our lives—romantically politically or otherwise—forms the basis for amens business empire daniel engber january   i rarely watch television news these days but the recent missile attacks by hamas on israeli civilians aroused my curiosity enough to want to hear what the pbs folks had to say about the attacks and the israeli response when the experts finished explaining why israel does this or that and how iran and syria do this or that and how emboldened hamas has become i continued to sit on the couch sipping a glass of inexpensive red wine before i knew it i was watching magnificent mind at any age with dr daniel amen after watching for about five minutes i said to my wife this is like an infomercial for this guys clinics then dr amen started telling his audience whoever they might be friends and family hired actors about the wonders of ginkgo and other natural products such as st johns wort wait a minute ive read about the latest studies on ginkgo and st johns wort this guy is still claiming that ginkgo helps with memory and with preventing dementia and that st johns wort helps with depression the most recent scientific studies have found neither of these claims to be true ive followed the argument that favors natural over synthetic supplements too theres no proven superiority of the one over the other more important theres no compelling evidence that taking supplements is beneficial for most people it is probably true though that there are fewer dangerous sideeffects from supplements than from potent pharmaceuticals and that if one could get the same benefit from a natural supplement as from a strong pharmaceutical one should choose the supplement because its probably cheaper and safer but how often is that the case probably never if the nutraceutical is as good as the pharmaceutical it probably has the same chemicals and would produce the same side effects early in his infomercial dr amen touted his use of spect single photon emission computed tomography a process that involves injecting the patient with radioactive dye and uses software that converts pictures of blood flow to parts of the brain into threedimensional colored images most spect images ive seen look like this           amens software produces some strange pictures here is an example             you can view rotating spect images on his website click here to view an image of a brain on drugs on his pbs infomercial amen showed some slides of nonrotating brains that had been morphed by software to produce holes where little or no blood was detected flowing he showed slides of what he said were diseased brains and healthy brains he told his audience that these spect images helped him diagnose all kinds of things he said hes done thousands of them i suppose we were to infer that he must know what hes talking about scientists are reading an awful lot into brain scans these days and much of what they are seeing may have originated in their own brains confirming their biases i had to wonder is dr amen ahead of the curve or another selfdeceived promoter of quackery i wasnt fifteen minutes into this program before i was asking myself why is this on pbs i paused the program thanks to tivo and did some googling before returning to the tv to find that amen was live in the studio of my local pbs station this was fundraising night and this great show was just one of the many great programs kvie brings to its sacramento area audience throughout the year and werent we lucky to have the great man himself in the studio to promote his own program yes it turns out that amen produced the program and it really was an infomercial though it was not billed as such no pbs station anywhere had anything to do with the production of amens program this guy is no dummy pbs on the other hand looks like a dummy to me it is because of programs that feature snake oil salesmen and purveyors of woo that i no longer support public television i dont care if a station puts on an infomercial but i care if my tax dollars are used to make the infomercial available to a large television audience why should the taxpayer subsidize these programs and why do we let pbs get away with the ruse of underwritten by or with support from when these are just paid advertisements by another name anyway amen wayne dyer suze orman andrew weil and others of like ilk might draw in pbs subscribers but they make my resistance even stronger make these folks pay for the infomercials for their books and products like advertisers do on commercial television what i found by googling amen was that hes a psychiatrist who is promoting ideas about keeping the brain healthy and improving mental functioning most of his ideas are either so well known as to be considered common sense or they are notions that dont have much scientific backing he recommends that we exercise both physically and mentally that we not smoke or drink alcohol to excess that we eat well and that we do what we can to control the stress in our lives nothing new here but then he suggests that these modest proposals joined with taking supplements which he just happens to sell from his website store can ward off or halt alzheimers among other things you wont find too many scientists agreeing with that hopeful claim i have been following the news on supplements for the past fifteen years and the bulk of the evidence strongly indicates that there is no benefit to most people from taking supplements unless they are specifically called for because of a known deficiency my mother who was a registered nurse wasted a lot of money on vitamin c tabs for our family at the first sign of a cold my sisters and i were like trained seals and headed for the vitamin c jar on his website amen says amen clinics is dedicated to improving the lives of every family we serve through education the latest advances in neuroimaging and individualized treatment plans we believe in using the least toxic most effective treatments for our patients and use a variety of interventions from natural supplements medications dietary interventions and targeted forms of psychotherapy amen clinics inc specializes in brain health and innovative diagnosis and treatment for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric behavioral and learning problems among children teenagers and adults established in  by daniel g amen md the center has a national reputation for utilizing brain spect imaging for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric problems including add anxiety depression autism and memory problems who wouldnt want the least toxic treatment are other doctors giving their patients toxic drugs when natural supplements with no adverse side effects would serve them just as well that seems to be the implication though its absurd using spect might be innovative but is it as useful as dr amen claims in a book he coauthored in  amen says through prevention strategies you may be able to delay the onset of alzheimers long enough so that you will never have symptoms one of the prevention strategies is early detection for which amen recommends spect for prevention he recommends various supplements his is a rather extravagant claim likely to give hope but rather questionable in an article in saloncom that is very critical of dr amen robert burton md writes spect scans are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to be useful in the diagnosis of ad alzheimers disease neurologist michael greicius who runs the stanford university memory clinic and has a special interest in the use of functional brain imaging in the diagnosis of ad tells me the pbs airing of amens program provides a stamp of scientific validity to work which has no scientific validity burton also castigates amen for his supplement recommendations for the prevention of alzheimers the recommendations seem based more on wishful thinking than compelling scientific data what about these spect scans for all the other things that dr amen treats he uses them in his diagnosis and treatment for many disorders attention deficit disorders add mood disorders anxiety and panic disorders autistic spectrum disorders obsessive compulsive disorder ocd substance abuse toxic exposure brain trauma memory problems temper problems and relationship and marital problems yes he treats alzheimers and does marriage counseling thats a pretty wide playing field can these scans really provide vital information about these disorders and problems can they really provide valuable data regarding appropriate treatment or counseling to answer these questions we must look at the control studies that have been done to see how effective spect scans are in diagnosing various brain disorders unfortunately the studies dont exist we have to rely on amens evaluation of his personal experience with thousands of scans over many years the self however is not exactly an unbiased observer of personal experience the potential for selfdeception here is enormous a critical thinker would rather see references to controlled studies than the selfserving testimonials from satisfied customers that one finds on dr amens website no wonder one searches in vain to find amens approach recommended by other psychiatrists he truly is a voice crying in the wilderness of his own making but hey amens been featured on the today show and the view and i predict that in  he will get a spot on oprah thereby cementing his place in the annals of woo along with dr oz dr deepak chopra and psychic john edward why wouldnt oprah have him on after all hes been on pbs update its now almost  years later nov   and pbs is still featuring an amen infomercial during its fundraising amen has started exercising and hes encouraging others to do the same cant fault that but he continues to integrate good health advice with nonsense and hamas continues to shell israel which responds with bombs of its own hmm hamas shells israel israel responds pbs uses an amen informercial for fundraising coincidence further information the cost of a complete evaluation at an amen clinic is  includes concentration and baseline scans the patients will need to allow  days of appointments with each appointment running approximately  hoursday for patients outside of california a phone consultation is advised with one of the physician staff to determine if the clinic is the appropriate place for an evaluation a consultation by phone will cost  per half hour theres a  discount for each additional family member being scanned dr amens website

daniel g amen md runs the amen clinics writes books gives lectures maintains a web site and makes other media appearances he recommends single photon emission computed tomography spect to help diagnose and manage cases of brain trauma underachievement school failure depression obsessive compulsive disorders anxiety aggressiveness cognitive decline and brain toxicity from drugs or alcohol he claims to use spect to rebalance a brain whose activity patterns are clearly abnormal” he describes spect as a window into the hardware of the soul he claims that spect scanning provides “guidance in the application of specific medications or other treatments such as supplements neurofeedback transcranial magnetic stimulation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy” in  quackwatch published an article in which i expressed skepticism about amens work in  attorneys representing amen complained that the article placed him in a negative light that was unfair our response included questions similar to those i raised in my article here are the questions the answers we received from attorney gayle mayfieldvenieris of mayfield  associates and my comments about the answers question what evidence is there that patients treated at the amen clinics that have spect tests do better than patients treated by competent professionals who do not use spect has any case series or controlled trial demonstrated such benefit amen response amen clinics tracks treatment response among its patients  of our patients report a high degree of satisfaction with our services we are not a typical psychiatric clinic we typically see patients who have failed  or  other mental health professionals and who have an average of  psychiatric disorders using standard dsm diagnostic measures no one keeps response rates on such a complex diagnostic group yet our results are very encouraging comment by dr hall this is an admission that there is no evidence high satisfaction rates are not relevant to the question of efficacy i dont doubt that dr amen helps many of the people who consult him the key question however is whether or not spect scanning is justifiable for most of them question are dr amens spect findings consistent enough that blinded observers could agree on the diagnosis from the scan alone amen response we never make the diagnosis from the scan alone we treat whole people not brain scans having said that we have a high degree of interrater reliability in reading the scans and teach others how to read them with the same accuracy comment by dr hall this admits that their scans have a low specificity and that they are relying in part on subjective factors to make their diagnoses question what are the rates of false positives and false negatives amen response for which disorders children adults and the elderly are all treated at amen clinics spect is a very reliable measure of blood flow and activity patterns in the brain we always use it with clinical information if you take our work with adhd we have scan patterns that predict with  accuracy who will respond and who will get worse with stimulant medication comment by dr hall the answer is “we don’t know” and unless it is published for peer review and replicated the  claim for adhd remains questionable question have the effects of different treatments on the scans actually been compared if so how and where has such data been published amen response we have published a study on emdr and have one in the works on meditation on amen clinics web site we have a medication and treatment response section where we list many scientific abstracts concerning before and after treatment with spect comment by dr hall since emdr itself has not been validated i do not believe it is possible to use it to validate spect results beforeandafter treatment scans are meaningless until they are put into perspective in a controlled study if a scan changes after treatment it should be asked whether other treatments or placebo might lead to the same change amen is claiming to base treatment choices on scans but he hasn’t established a firm basis for those choices  question what is brain balance and how is it measured amen response we measure it through before and after spect studies we look for three things i areas of the brain that work well ii areas of the brain that work too hard and iii areas of the brain that do not work hard enough we also compare our work through a large normal database that we have the goal is to balance brain function such as calm the overactive areas and enhance the underactive ones comment by dr hall the statement above does not define balance or state how it is quantified question what do spect scans show that should change how a patient is treated amen response many things spect shows the function or dysfunction of specific brain regions implicated with specific problems such as the prefrontal cortex with executive function and the medial temporal lobes with getting information into longterm storage thus we can target brain systems not just vague dsm diagnoses spect shows unexpected findings that may be contributing to the problems such as toxicity potential areas of seizure activity or past brain trauma this dramatically changes treatment such as eliminating the toxin spect shows potential underlying seizure activity that may be contributing to the problem often more accurately seen by spect than standard eeg especially in the areas of the medial temporal lobes spect shows specific target areas for treatment such as an overactive anterior cingulate gyrus seen with ocd spectrum disorders or an underactive temporal lobe seen in seizure disorders and other disorders such as trauma spect shows the specific effect of medication on the brain and subsequently how to adjust dosages patients often report that ssris are helpful but also cause demotivation or memory problems spect studies can show when ssris are causing excessive decreased prefrontal or temporal lobe activity that clinical evaluation only hints at              spect scans helps provide real demonstrable answers to refractory symptoms and in addition helps clinicians ask better and more targeted questions—about toxic exposure brain injuries anoxia inflammation or infection that patients may have initially denied or forgotten spect scans help clinicians prevent mistakes or hurting patients by prescribing the wrong treatments such as unnecessarily stimulating an already overactive brain or calming an underactive one spect scans help to evaluate those who may be at risk for dementia—the brain starts to change long before people show symptoms of dementia one study reported that there has to be a loss of  in the hippocampus before symptoms occur using autopsy data in  patients bonte reported that brain spect had a positive predictive value for alzheimers disease of   spect scans can help differentiate between types of dementia spect scans can identify specific areas of the brain hurt by trauma to better target treatment and help deal with insurance legal and rehabilitation issues spect scans can often identify a specific cause or reason that contributes to recovering alcoholics drug addicts eating disordered or sexual addicts relapse behavior in their recovery from an addictive process for example the patient may have suffered an injury in the prefrontal cortex or temporal lobes or have overactivity in basal ganglia limbic system or prefrontal cortex each of which could contribute to the relapsing behaviors spect scans allow patients to have a specific physical representation of their problems that is accurate and reliable spect scans help develop a deeper understanding of the problem and lead to decreased shame guilt stigma and selfloathing they can increase selfforgiveness patients can see that their problems are in part a medical problem spect scans help to increase compliance the images can powerfully influence a patients willingness and ability to accept and adhere to a treatment program as they realize they are not taking medication for their problems of anxiety depression rage or add but rather to optimize brain function an idea similar to needing glasses for their eyesight spect scans may help families understand when things will not get better such as having permanent brain damage from an injury which allows patients and families to accept the condition and provide accordingly spect scans help substance abusers decrease denial and increase motivation for treatment by seeing the damage they have done to their own specific brain spect scans can help motivate recovering alcoholics and addicts to continue in sobriety as it becomes clear that further use will cause increased brain damage spect scans physically show patients how treatments have impacted improved or worsened brain function spect scans help motivate verbally and physically abusive spouses to follow medication protocols by seeing they have a physical abnormality that may be contributing to their problems spect scans are useful for patients who are suffering with a post chemotherapy toxic brain it gives them insight into their cognitive struggles and also helps their doctors see what is physical and what might be emotional or traumatic sequelae of having cancer spect scans allow patients to understand why specific treatments are indicated which medications are helpful and why certain medical interventions are chosen comment by dr hall the above list contains lots of claims but little substance for instance do we really need thousands of dollars worth of radioactive injections and scans to “help patients understand” the treatments we prescribe where are the objective data showing what percentages of patients have a better outcome with this information  this reminds me a bit of the ultrasound pictures of fetuses offered at some malls—nice to have for your scrapbook but not medically necessary or useful question does dr amen claim that spect can help evaluate the patients soul if so what gets measured amen response no dr amen uses the analogy that the brain is the hardware of the soul but has never said he could measure the soul you can read his book healing the hardware of the soul to get a better understanding of his thoughts in this area comment by dr hall the first chapter of the book is called the brain is the souls fragile dwelling place the feedback loop between the brain and the soul offers new answer it claims that the brainsoul connection can help us understand good    evil    sin    love    hate    and   child abuse the passage in which this claim appears also speculates that mother teresa and mahatma gandhi had optimal brain function whereas adolph hitler and other brutal dictators had faulty brain wiring the book describes spect as a window into the hardware of the soul the book also promises that clinically based brainsoul healing techniques    will help you optimize your brain and improve your relationships work and spiritual connections in the deepest ways possible it seems to me that dr amen regards the soul as more than an analogy question why did dr amen leap into clinical applications writing for the public appearing on television and lecturing about findings that most doctors would consider preliminary amen response dr amen started this work in  at the time other doctors including academics were using this technique including ismael mena at ucla nora milne at uc irvine james merikangas at georgetown and thomas jaeger at creighton the american psychiatric association sponsored allday workshops on brain spect in child and adult psychiatry dr amen has taught at the apa annual meeting on five occasions he also started publishing on his work the society of nuclear medicine has procedure guidelines on the use of spect in clinical practice and recommends it for brain injury and dementia two common uses of the amen clinics dr amen is a clinician and he found dramatic positive results from using the scans others were doing the work as well in  dr amen is the most visible because of his writing and speaking skills and his ability to attract patients comment by dr hall the fact that amen “believed” he was seeing dramatic positive results does not mean that his explanation for what he saw was correct it is all too common for clinicians and patients to deceive themselves that is why beliefs should be tested with scientific studies the apa may welcome amens opinions but its current  psychiatric evaluation of adults guideline states that the clinical utility of neuroimaging techniques for planning of individualized treatment has not yet been shown question do the amen clinics use a consent form that indicates what uses of spect are experimental if so please supply me with a copy amen response amen clinics has a general consent form for spect it states some professionals consider spect experimental but many do not amen clinics has nearly  mental health professionals who refer patients to its clinics you can see amen clinics spect consent form in its intake packet comment by dr hall the pertinent paragraph in the consent form states brain spect studies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain function in seizures strokes dementia and head trauma there are literally thousands of research articles on these topics in our clinic based on our fifteen years of experience we have developed this technology further to evaluate neuropsychiatric conditions  unfortunately many physicians do not fully understand the application of spect imaging and may tell you that the technology is experimental but over  physicians and mental health professionals from across the united states have referred patients to us for scans this is not a fair representation of the facts doing research that follows a clearly stated protocol that can lead to valid conclusions is one thing but exposing patients to expense and unnecessary radiation based on hunches is something else a consent form is supposed to place a procedure in proper perspective its true that spect has been extensively studied and has recognized medical uses however the above paragraph fails to make it clear that many and possibly most of the amen clinics scans are taken for nonrecognized uses—such as a general brain health checkup the consent form acknowledges that opposition exists but it implies that physicians who consider spect experimental for these purposes are ignorant it should state that the prevailing medical opinion does not support spect use for most psychiatric disorders the front page of the page intake packet states that the clinic does not bill insurance but provides receipts that may be submitted to insurance carriers for reimbursement i believe this statement is misleading because insurance companies do not cover spect scans for most of amens patients spect is indeed approved for a few specific indications but the amen clinic is using it for other indications that are clearly experimental at this stage the policy statements of aetna bluecross blueshield of georgia cigna provide detailed discussions of what these companies considers proven versus experimental uses the letter from attorney mayfieldvenieris also stated there is no indication that dr hall has any clinical experience with spect or any other experience that justifies her assertions or qualifies her as an expert in this field on the contrary dr hall is a family physician and cites no references in support of her opinions no i do not have any clinical experience with spect but i am as qualified as any other critical thinker to read the claims on amen’s web site and recognize that they are not backed up with good evidence experience is not an issue i would not have to have experience practicing homeopathy to determine that it is bogus or experience doing csections to determine that they save babies’ lives experience can even be a detriment because those who work in the field may be unduly influenced by personal experiences testimonials and financial interests and sometimes it takes an outsider to see things more objectively it is natural to be enthusiastic about any new imaging or treatment procedure but initial promises are not always fulfilled if dr amen’s method is not as good as he thinks he is subjecting patients to unnecessary radiation and expense if it is as good as he thinks his lack of rigorous research is postponing the day when it will be generally recognized and offered to everyone and paid for by insurance there are arguments for doing everything possible to help difficult patients before the research is complete but there are also arguments for limiting treatment to closely monitored research settings until the truth is known for additional information aetna clinical policy bulletin on spect aetna clinical policy
