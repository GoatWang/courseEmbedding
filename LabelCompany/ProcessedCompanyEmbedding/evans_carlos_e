banking wells fargo’s carlos evans retiring after 4 years said yes to big challenges by deon roberts  derobertscharlotteobservercom linkedin google pinterest reddit print order reprint of this story may  4  am carlos evans who is retiring as a wells fargo executive at the end of this month had frontrow seats to two pivotal moments in charlotte history and they both came at him at once it was late summer  and the us financial system was unraveling evans’ employer wachovia was in trouble then evans got the news that the chairman of united way of central carolinas was resigning amid the controversy over compensation for the organization’s ceo that meant evans a united way board member was suddenly next up to chair the organization he gave serious thought to declining the volunteer post his own professional fate was uncertain as concerns about wachovia’s financial stability began to mount “my first reaction was ‘you can’t do this you’ve got everything going on at the bank’ ” he said “but then i sort of realized that i was copping out” evans said yes becoming chairman of united way just weeks before san franciscobased wells fargo agreed to buy wachovia evans  who now oversees commercial banking in the eastern us for wells fargo is retiring after a 4year career in banking across the carolinas his operation serves middlemarket businesses those with annual sales between about  million and about  billion he also oversees government and institutional banking for wells fargo nationally he said no challenge he’s faced can match the wachovia and united way crises which he calls the most difficult moment of his career “i lost weight i was sick – sick – with what was going on at wachovia what was going on at united way but it was my responsibility to do both” wachovia had been hurt by loan losses from its  acquisition of mortgage lender golden west financial “i didn’t know about the golden west merger until after it happened” evans said “i was not involved in any way shape or form in the due diligence  there is nothing i could have done” “i was doing everything i could do to save wachovia” he said saying yes taking a risk evans’ journey to charlotte began in his native city of florence in northeast south carolina a selfdescribed “country boy” he went to newberry college in south carolina where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics his first banking job was with bankers trust of south carolina a predecessor to bank of america as a management trainee “which meant that i washed cars ran errands” he said “back then a management trainee was the lowest of the low” in 7 he was asked to coordinate completion of interior construction for bankers trust’s new headquarters and plan and manage the move to a tower in columbia he was only  had only been on the job for a handful of months and had no experience overseeing such a project evans wondered whether he had done the right thing working on the headquarters project felt like a detour and he was distressed watching his peers in the company advance to jobs as branch managers and commercial bankers but he met the bank’s chairman hootie johnson while working on the project which he thinks helped create other opportunities in the company for him in  he was asked to run bankers trust’s operations in the hilton head island region it would mean relocating from the columbia area and moving his wife of then just two years lisa away from their friends and family again he said yes “if you’re from a small town in south carolina that was like going to a foreign country” he said “almost didn’t do it” evans said the job allowed him to show that he could boost the bank’s business in the lowcountry of south carolina “we grew exponentially and that caught people’s attention” he said “we built six branches while i was there” accepting that job was an example of a risk that paid off said evans who encourages people to take risks in their career paths “i can think about the major inflection points in my career and they were all tied to situations where i was willing to take risks that other people weren’t willing to take” after other relocations and promotions he made his way to charlotte around  to head carolinas commerical lending for north carolina national bank which would become nationsbank in  and bank of america in  ‘total blur’ by late summer  as the us financial system’s troubles were escalating uncertainty was growing for wachovia the lender was posting billions of dollars in losses stemming from its golden west financial acquisition as well as complex securities sold by its investment bank there was talk of thousands of jobs being cut and by fall  regulators were looking for a buyer for wachovia at the time evans was over commercial banking business banking and the auto finance business for wachovia on sept  the chairman of united way of central carolinas resigned amid the fallout of the  million in salary and benefits paid to its former ceo evans now had to become chairman months before he was scheduled to take the role he accepted the post even though he had doubts about whether he should considering the unfolding crisis at wachovia “in my heart of hearts i knew it was my responsibility” he said “it just became a total blur” evans said he had not been on the united way board when the ceo’s pension known as a supplemental executive retirement plan or serp was approved jane mcintyre who became executive director of united way of central carolinas in  said evans had to chair the organization as its annual fundraising campaign was in full swing the organization found itself trying to raise funds not only at a challenging time for the us economy but also as the reputation of the local united way was suffering “carlos really had to have full oversight for the operations and at the same time try to keep the campaign going it had to be hard” mcintyre said evans recalls doing a lot of traveling at that time to reassure customers and clients concerned about the bank when he’d return to charlotte he’d also have to deal with the crisis at united way at the time evans was working on the th floor in one wells fargo the same building he works in today three to four times a week he said he would walk the three or so blocks from his building to the united way to help out the organization “if you can imagine the highest years of your earning life all tied up in wachovia stock and to see all that go down the drain pretty disconcerting to say the least” he said “it wasn’t just united way it wasn’t just the bank it was a combination of those things along with my own personal situation given the loss of a significant portion of everything that i had worked for through the years” he declined to disclose his salary which is not among those the bank must report in public regulatory filings evans said he’s proud of being able to help retain employees and clients as wachovia was being integrated into wells fargo looking back at his chairing at united way evans said he’s proud that the organization was able to survive through a combination of costcutting and using reserves to continue funding the agencies that receive united way dollars “there were so many decisions that were being made in rapid succession” he said “as board chair i had to lead every one of those changes i had to be the principal person for gathering input and leading the board to consensus on every one of those things” evans served on united way’s board until the end of  a more mellow banker evans said he’s not exactly the same banker he was when he started his career joel smith a banking colleague and mentor who began working with evans in the s said evans sometimes became frustrated when waiting for approvals from within the bank to close deals he had put together for commercial clients “there is a healthy tension inside of banks between the people who produce business and the people who underwrite” smith said “the only place i ever saw him really show that he was impatient were times when he was so sure that something was done right and he had to keep going back to the well to get approval and that is common with a lot of bankers “he’s as good a banker at what he does as i’ve ever seen” said smith who last worked with evans 4 years ago “i can understand why it would be frustrating he did a lot of deals he was less patient than most but he overcame it” evans admits that he would get frustrated while waiting for loan approvals for his clients “i would like to think that i’m still as impatient and moving in a positive way to get things done” he said “but i have mellowed and i have learned to not put as much pressure on myself as well as the people around me as i probably did earlier in my career” evans who owns a home in charleston said his home in charlotte’s eastover community will remain his primary residence he said he plans to be active in retirement “i would like to serve on some public company and private company boards which i couldn’t do as an employee of wells fargo “i will not be one of those people who retires and goes and plays golf every day not that i have anything against that i’m just not built that way” never miss a local story sign up today for a free  day free trial of unlimited digital access subscribe now   comments   videos
