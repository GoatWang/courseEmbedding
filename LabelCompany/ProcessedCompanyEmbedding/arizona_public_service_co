critical rate case settlement author by krysti shallenberger klshall • published march   dive brief arizona public service co and a group of solar interests filed a settlement on rate design and rooftop solar compensation with the arizona corporation commission following years of contentious debate  under the agreement new rooftop solar customers would be paid kwh for excess energy exported to the grid the export rate would decline  annually for new rooftop solar systems but customers would lock in their rates for  years when they sign up  solar energy consumed by end users themselves would be valued at about kwh but exact rates would vary by customer usage patterns and rate design the offset rate would be lower for demand charge rate options likely between  and kwh the agreement also includes rate design options for rooftop solar and nonrooftop solar customers including timeofuse rates and residential demand charges the agreement also establishes a year grandfathering period for customers who file an interconnection application before a decision is issued in the rate case  ​dive insight after five years of debate over rooftop solar compensation and rate design arizona public service and solar interests have filed a settlement that could provide policy stability for installers the utilitys service area under the new agreement rooftop solar customers can choose from four rate design options that include a timeofuse rate plan with a grid access charge or a demandbased rate plan without a grid access charge the settlement does not include a mandatory demand charge as aps originally proposed  the export rate for rooftop solar energy is set for this year at kwh and will step down  annually in years to come for new customers customers would receive the export rate of the year of their interconnection application for  years the export rate is different however from the offset rate — the rate solar customers will be credited on their utility bills for every kwh of selfgenerated solar they consume the offset according to the settlement will be determined by the load profile and production profile of aps customers with dg at the outset the settlement estimates the offset rate would be about kwh but will depend on individual usage patters and dg system size orientation and production  for the demandcharge rate design the solar energy consumed onsite will likely be valued between  and kwh according to aps  both the export and offset rates are below what rooftop solar customers are paid under retail rate net metering — between kwh and kwh in arizona existing solar users would be able to keep their original retail rate compensation for  years  if the settlement is approved by regulators arizona will join a growing number of states where utilities and solar advocates have reached deals to move away from retail rate net metering similar compromises were notably reached in new york and colorado last year  the deal is the product of half a decade of solar debates in arizona in  after two years of contested regulatory proceedings regulators opened a value of solar docket to settle the rooftop compensation issue at the end of  regulators concluded that docket by deciding to end the retail rate net metering program in favor of new compensation models based on utilities avoided cost rates for other generation the final compensation rates however were to be determined in individual rate cases  earlier this year the acc approved a rate proposal from tucson electric power which offered timeofuse and residential demand charge options as well as a modest increase in solar fees the tep decision however did not include a final ruling on rooftop solar compensation setting up the aps rate case to provide a precedent for the state  its been our position to get ahead of rooftop solar issues and try to create a sustainable solar path said greg bernosky director of regulation and compliance at aps its intended as a bridge to other technologies we didn’t solve for just for solar we wanted to solve for things that are starting to happen    the settlement doesnt stop at rate design and solar compensation all parties involved pledged in a separate agreement to stand by the settlement if it is approved and refrain from undermining it through ballot initiatives or advocacy tactics at the acc the settlement would also institute a selfbuild moratorium for aps meaning the utility cannot attempt to build any new generation before  unless given explicit approval by the acc the moratorium extends to the end of december  for combinedcycle gas generation units but exempts microgrids renewables distributed generation power purchases and upgrades to existing facilities  solar advocates applauded the agreement approved by  of  stakeholders in the docket the arizona solar energy industries association ariseia hopes the settlement will end years of attacks on the rooftop solar industry in arizona the future of arizona’s solar industry was very much on the line in this case and while this settlement doesn’t help arizona solar grow it allows solar to remain a viable option for some arizonans” brandon cheshire president of the board of ariseia said in a statement  this post has been updated to clarify information about the solar export rate recommended reading arizona corporation commission staffs notice of
