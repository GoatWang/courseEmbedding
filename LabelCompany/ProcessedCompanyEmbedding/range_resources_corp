faucets and household machinery showers smelling of rotten eggs hydrogen sulfide and diarrhea mysterious stomach pains extreme fatigue or anemia medical tests of residents complaining of headaches nosebleeds and the inability to concentrate showed elevated blood levels of organic solvents and heavy metals such as toluene and arsenic when presented with such complaints range resources argued that its labs test results show that complaints of illness and dying animals were not caused by its activities and instead had other causes according to a letter from range resources to a complainant dated january   on november   you voluntarily supplied range resources with lab results from both your dog and horse veterinarians upon review of these results range contacted the canine and equine veterinarians … it was stated by the veterinarian that the test results were inconclusive for antifreeze ethylene glycol poising … the veterinarian indicated that the horse had toxicity of the liver

dated october   the pennsylvania department of environmental protection tested the landowners well water twice and found no contamination in the water range resources paid  in fines to the commonwealth of pennsylvania as of may  the bulk was  levied for a fracking fluid spill that killed aquatic life in brush creek in washington county pennsylvania which is protected by the state as a highquality waterway according to the pittsburgh business times however ray walker vice president said that range resources has made a lot of adjustments since then the fluid spill was due to a faulty elbow pipe according to walker range has since gone to a completely different pipe manufacturer and a completely different pipe design firings and changed procedures also followed the incident in

contaminated soil and groundwater contamination of water in parker county texasedit in  the environmental protection agency issued an emergency order against range stating that the companys drilling activities in parker county texas had led to the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells the company denied the allegations and said the presence of methane was a result of naturally occurring migration and had shown up in nearby water wells long before range drilled its gas wells the environmental protection agency epa said that natural gas drilling by the company has contributed to the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells in the county and ordered it to step in immediately based on our findings to date its very clear that our activities have not had any impact on the water aquifer in southern parker county or the subject water wells range resources said in a statement the company said its investigations revealed that methane in the aquifer existed long before its drilling and likely is a naturally occurring migration from several shallow gas zones immediately below the water aquifer however after a hearing in  texas railroad commission staff concluded that based on chemical composition the gas in the water wells came from the shallow strawn formation rather than the deeper barnett shale in which the range wells were completed they also concluded that pressure tests by range showed mechanical integrity of the casing epa and the two homeowners were invited to present evidence at the hearing but did not in march  the epa dropped its order against range range resources said the move could help its  million defamation lawsuit against a parker county couple who alleged in a  million lawsuit that range

the wonderful experiences they’ve had with range resources according to elwin green of the pittsburgh postgazette range resources stands out because most gas companies generally prefer to keep a low profile preferring to tout their successes to wall street but not to main street in contrast range resources campaign uses testimonials such as natural gas has been  a godsend to this area from farmers or in the last two years probably  percent of our business is natural gas from local business owners vice president ray walker was quoted as saying a lot of people dont know much about our industry or about range resourceswere committed to being the very best that we can be we want to be accountable transparent and accessible to people videos produced by public relations firms big picture communications and downtowns animal inc used unscripted video and purposely avoided using company spokespeople blake lewis ceo of lewis public relations in dallas and a board member of the public relations society of america gave range resources website high marks however journalists reactions have been skeptical or mixed according to myers a quick review of the state department of environmental protection records suggests that the truth is more complicated than the ads suggestthe folks at range define good stewardship in a slightly different manner than is customary reg henry of the pittsburgh postgazette thought the whole promotion was skin crawling but now i read myrangeresources and i think how cute is that for a gas drilling company it makes me think of my daughter’s

family that alleged their acre farm had been destroyed by oil and gas development between  and  the pittsburgh postgazette sought to obtain court records related to the case when a judge ordered records unsealed the settlement agreement was initially not included in the  pages of records released the agreement itself was released after the postgazette and another newspaper the observerreporter sued to gain access as part of the settlement the family agreed to a gag order preventing them from talking about fracking for the rest of their lives the gag order covered not just the adults but also the children then aged seven and ten years old although the court transcript records an attorney for range resources saying that the order applies to the children and that the company would certainly enforce it the general counsel for range resources said otherwise after court records were unsealed in a  letter to the hallowichs attorney that was also released to the media the general counsel for the company said range has never at any time had the intention of seeking to hold a minor child legally accountable for a breach of that provision of the settlement agreement the lawyer for the hallowich family said range had waived the confidentiality of the agreement by releasing the letter to a cable network and that the family would seek judicial remedy litigation

timeline          strategy board of directors senior management vendor relations electronic payments contact information our business strategy our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a costefficient basis our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with occasional acquisitions and divestitures of noncore assets our strategy requires us to make significant investments and financial commitments in technical staff acreage seismic data drilling and completion technology and gathering and transportation arrangements to build drilling inventory and market our products our strategy has the following key elements commit to environmental protection and worker and community safety we strive to implement the latest technologies and best commercial practices to minimize adverse impacts from the development of our properties on the environment worker health and safety and the safety of the communities where we operate we analyze and review performance while striving for continual improvement by working with peer companies regulators nongovernmental organizations industries not related to the oil and natural gas industry and other engaged stakeholders we expect every employee to maintain safe operations minimize environmental impact and conduct their daily business with the highest ethical standards concentrate in core operating areas we currently operate primarily in two regions pennsylvania and north louisiana concentrating our drilling and producing activities in these core areas allows us to develop the regional expertise needed to interpret specific geological and operating conditions and develop economies of scale operating in core areas as large as the marcellus shale and the lower cotton valley allows us to reach our goal of consistent production and reserve growth at attractive returns we intend to further develop our acreage in both the marcellus shale and north louisiana and improve our well results through the use of technology and detailed analysis of our properties we periodically evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities in the united states including opportunities to acquire particular natural gas and oil properties or entities owning natural gas and oil assets and at any given time we may be in various stages of evaluating such opportunities maintain a multiyear drilling inventory we focus on areas with multiple prospective and productive horizons and development opportunities we use our technical expertise to build and maintain a multiyear drilling inventory we believe that a large multiyear inventory of drilling projects increases our ability to efficiently plan for the economic growth of production and reserves currently we have over  proven and unproven drilling locations in inventory we actively seek to find and develop new natural gas and oil plays with significant exploration and exploitation potential focus on cost efficiency we concentrate in areas which we believe to have sizeable hydrocarbon deposits in place that will allow us to consistently increase production while controlling costs because there is little longterm competitive sales price advantage available to a commodity producer the costs to find develop and produce a commodity are important to organizational sustainability and longterm stockholder value creation we endeavor to control costs such that our cost to find develop and produce natural gas ngls and oil is one of the lowest in the industry we operate almost all of our total net production and believe that our extensive knowledge of the geologic and operating conditions in the areas where we operate provides us with the ability to achieve operational efficiencies maintain a longlife reserve base longlife natural gas and oil reserves provide a more stable growth platform than shortlife reserves longlife reserves reduce reinvestment risk as they lessen the amount of reinvestment capital deployed each year to replace production longlife natural gas and oil reserves also assist us in minimizing costs as stable production makes it easier to build and maintain operating economies of scale longlife reserves also offer upside from technology enhancements we use our drilling divestiture and acquisition activities to assist in executing this strategy market our products to a large number of customers in different markets under a variety of commercial terms we market our natural gas ngls and oil to a large number of customers in both domestic and international markets to maximize cash flow and diversify risk we hold numerous firm transportation contracts on multiple pipelines to enable us to transport and sell natural gas and ngls in the midwest gulf coast southeast northeast and international markets we sell our products under a variety of price indexes and price formulas that assist us in optimizing regional price differentials and commodity price volatility maintain operational and financial flexibility because of the risks involved in drilling coupled with changing commodity prices we are flexible and adjust our capital budget throughout the year if certain areas generate higher than anticipated returns we may accelerate development in those areas and decrease expenditures elsewhere we also believe in maintaining a strong balance sheet ample liquidity and using commodity derivatives to help stabilize our realized prices we believe this provides more predictable cash flows and financial results we regularly review our asset base to identify nonstrategic assets the disposition of which will increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies provide employee equity ownership and incentive compensation we want our employees to think and act like business owners to achieve this we reward and encourage them through equity ownership in range all fulltime employees are eligible to receive equity grants as of december   our employees and directors owned equity

well the list includes the volume concentration and purpose of the chemicals however court documents show that range resources does not know the makeup of the products it uses to extract natural gas from shale hydraulic fracturing critics list range resources wells and violations at fracktrack  water and air pollution in washington county pennsylvaniaedit this american life and the new york times investigated the companys operations in amwell township and mount pleasant township washington county pennsylvania journalists eliza griswold and sarah koenig found allegations that gas wells owned by range resources caused water pollution and air pollution residents complained of black running water that corroded faucets and household machinery showers smelling of rotten eggs hydrogen sulfide and diarrhea mysterious stomach pains extreme fatigue or anemia medical tests of residents complaining of headaches nosebleeds and the inability to concentrate showed elevated blood levels of organic solvents and heavy metals such as toluene and arsenic when presented with such complaints range resources argued that its labs test results show that complaints of illness and dying animals were not caused by its activities and instead had other causes according to a letter from range resources to a complainant dated january   on november   you voluntarily supplied range resources with lab results from both your dog and horse veterinarians upon review of these results range contacted the canine and equine veterinarians … it was stated by the veterinarian that the test results were inconclusive for antifreeze ethylene glycol poising … the veterinarian indicated that the horse had toxicity of the liver which he felt was not related to ethylene glycol poisoning one resident in amwell township was riding her horse behind range resources pond for holding fracking chemical flowback when she noticed a hissing and bubbling sound in the stream and a red foamy oil slick that caused the stream to exhibit rainbow water range maintained that it was likely caused by decayed vegetation that gave off gas having attributed previous complaints of malodor to harmless anaerobic bacteria that grew near its fluid compressor stations however chemical tests of the area later revealed the presence of acetone toluene benzene phenol arsenic barium heavy metals and methane range resources then paid to have a water well drilled for the landowner which the owner said also was contaminated according to a letter dated october   the pennsylvania department of environmental protection tested the landowners well water twice and found no contamination in the water range resources paid  in fines to the commonwealth of pennsylvania as of may  the bulk was  levied for a fracking fluid spill that killed aquatic life in brush creek in washington county pennsylvania which is protected by the state as a highquality waterway according to the pittsburgh business times however ray walker vice president said that range resources has made a lot of adjustments since then the fluid spill was due to a faulty elbow pipe according to walker range has since gone to a completely different pipe manufacturer and a completely different pipe design firings and changed procedures also followed the incident in september  range resources was ordered to pay a  million penalty to settle violations related to six marcellus shale gas drilling and fracking wastewater impoundments in washington county that contaminated soil and groundwater contamination of water in parker county texasedit in  the environmental protection agency issued an emergency order against range stating that the companys drilling activities in parker county texas had led to the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells the company denied the allegations and said the presence of methane was a result of naturally occurring migration and had shown up in nearby water wells long before range drilled its gas wells the environmental protection agency epa said that natural gas drilling by the company has contributed to the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells in the county and ordered it to step in immediately based on our findings to date its very clear that our activities have not had any impact on the water aquifer in southern parker county or the subject water wells range resources said in a statement the company said its investigations revealed that methane in the aquifer existed long before its drilling and likely is a naturally occurring migration from several shallow gas zones immediately below the water aquifer however after a hearing in  texas railroad commission staff concluded that based on chemical composition the gas in the water wells came from the shallow strawn formation rather than the deeper barnett shale in which the range wells were completed they also concluded that pressure tests by range showed mechanical integrity of the casing epa and the two homeowners were invited to present evidence at the hearing but did not in march  the epa dropped its order against range range resources said the move could help its  million defamation lawsuit against a parker county couple who alleged in a  million lawsuit that range contaminated their drinking water in december  the federal office of the inspector general addressing complaints by six us senators issued a report concluding that the epa had been justified in issuing its  emergency order and had acted reasonably in withdrawing the order after range had agreed to groundwater quality monitoring public relations campaign regarding zoningedit range resources has sponsored public relations campaigns supporting permitted use zoning regulations rather than conditional use zoning which would provide for casebycase hearings for citizen review of ranges drilling near their land or neighborhoods according to npr mount pleasant and its three citizen supervisors were ridiculously outmannedin an ensuing fullscale pr war with range resources when the supervisors decided to follow conditional use zoning policy used in other states such as texas colorado and wyoming through letters to lessors range wrote that it might stop drilling in the township if the township enacted conditional use zoning other townships that enacted conditional use zoning have been sued by range resources use of former military personneledit on november   cnbc reported on a conference which range resources attended in which those in the energy industry were advised to download the us army  marine corps counterinsurgency manual because we are dealing with an insurgency in the conference range resources spokesman matt pitzarella also said that range had several former psy ops folkswho are very comfortable in dealing with localized issues and local governments really all they do is spend most of their time helping folks develop local ordinances and things like that but very much having that understanding of psy ops in the army and in the middle east has applied very helpfully here for us in pennsylvania pitzarella later clarified that he meant to refer to one employee of the firm whose psy ops background made him adept at handling emotionally charged township meetings however sharon wilson the recorder of the remarks said the comments reveal what the fracking industry thinks about people in the communities that are impacted by the industry  public relations campaign regarding benefits of

washington county pennsylvania and began production in the marcellus shale and in  the company spent  million to acquire additional land nearby in  the company acquired stroud energy and its major position in the barnett shale for  million in  forbes magazine called range resources king of the marcellus shalethe company had spent less than  per acre on average to acquire land suitable for drilling compared to larger traditional oil and gas players who joined the exploration rush late in the game who had paid as much as  an acre in  the company exchanged its assets in the permian basin for assets in the nora field in virginia plus  million in cash in  the company sold its assets in the nora field in virginia to enervest for  million in  the company acquired memorial resource development in an allstock transaction valued at  billion controversiesedit environmental recordedit chemicals used in hydraulic fracturingedit range resources said it would list chemicals used in its hydraulic fracturing on its website giving regulators and landowners an account of the chemicals injected into each well the list includes the volume concentration and purpose of the chemicals however court documents show that range resources does not know the makeup of the products it uses to extract natural gas from shale hydraulic fracturing critics list range resources wells and violations at fracktrack  water and air pollution in washington county pennsylvaniaedit this american life and the new york times investigated the companys operations in amwell township and mount pleasant township washington county pennsylvania journalists eliza griswold and sarah koenig found allegations that gas wells owned by range resources caused water pollution and air pollution residents complained of black running water that corroded faucets and household machinery showers smelling of rotten eggs hydrogen sulfide and diarrhea mysterious stomach pains extreme fatigue or anemia medical tests of residents complaining of headaches nosebleeds and the inability to concentrate showed elevated blood levels of organic solvents and heavy metals such as toluene and arsenic when presented with such complaints range resources argued that its labs test results show that complaints of illness and dying animals were not caused by its activities and instead had other causes according to a letter from range resources to a complainant dated january   on november   you voluntarily supplied range resources with lab results from both your dog and horse veterinarians upon review of these results range contacted the canine and equine veterinarians … it was stated by the veterinarian that the test results were inconclusive for antifreeze ethylene glycol poising … the veterinarian indicated that the horse had toxicity of the liver which he felt was not related to ethylene glycol poisoning one resident in amwell township was riding her horse behind range resources pond for holding fracking chemical flowback when she noticed a hissing and bubbling sound in the stream and a red foamy oil slick that caused the stream to exhibit rainbow water range maintained that it was likely caused by decayed vegetation that gave off gas having attributed previous complaints of malodor to harmless anaerobic bacteria that grew near its fluid compressor stations however chemical tests of the area later revealed the presence of acetone toluene benzene phenol arsenic barium heavy metals and methane range resources then paid to have a water well drilled for the landowner which the owner said also was contaminated according to a letter dated october   the pennsylvania department of environmental protection tested the landowners well water twice and found no contamination in the water range resources paid  in fines to the commonwealth of pennsylvania as of may  the bulk was  levied for a fracking fluid spill that killed aquatic life in brush creek in washington county pennsylvania which is protected by the state as a highquality waterway according to the pittsburgh business times however ray walker vice president said that range resources has made a lot of adjustments since then the fluid spill was due to a faulty elbow pipe according to walker range has since gone to a completely different pipe manufacturer and a completely different pipe design firings and changed procedures also followed the incident in september  range resources was ordered to pay a  million penalty to settle violations related to six marcellus shale gas drilling and fracking wastewater impoundments in washington county that contaminated soil and groundwater contamination of water in parker county texasedit in  the environmental protection agency issued an emergency order against range stating that the companys drilling activities in parker county texas had led to the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells the company denied the allegations and said the presence of methane was a result of naturally occurring migration and had shown up in nearby water wells long before range drilled its gas wells the environmental protection agency epa said that natural gas drilling by the company has contributed to the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells in the county and ordered it to step in immediately based on our findings to date its very clear that our activities have not had any impact on the water aquifer in southern parker county or the subject water wells range resources said in a statement the company said its investigations revealed that methane in the aquifer existed long before its drilling and likely is a naturally occurring migration from several shallow gas zones immediately below the water aquifer however after a hearing in  texas railroad commission staff concluded that based on chemical composition the gas in the water wells came from the shallow strawn formation rather than the deeper barnett shale in which the range wells were completed they also concluded that pressure tests by range showed mechanical integrity of the casing epa and the two homeowners were invited to present evidence at the hearing but did not in march  the epa dropped its order against range range resources said the move could help its  million defamation lawsuit against a parker county couple who alleged in a  million lawsuit that range contaminated their drinking water in december  the federal office of the inspector general addressing complaints by six us senators issued a report concluding that the epa had been justified in issuing its  emergency order and had acted reasonably in withdrawing the order after range had agreed to groundwater quality monitoring public relations campaign regarding zoningedit range resources has sponsored public relations campaigns supporting permitted use zoning regulations rather than conditional use zoning which would provide for casebycase hearings for citizen review of ranges drilling near their land or neighborhoods according to npr mount pleasant and its three citizen supervisors were ridiculously outmannedin an ensuing fullscale pr war with range resources when the supervisors decided to follow conditional use zoning policy used in other states such as texas colorado and wyoming through letters to lessors range wrote that it might stop drilling in the township if the township enacted conditional use zoning other townships that enacted conditional use zoning have been sued by range resources use of former military personneledit on november   cnbc reported on a conference which range resources attended in which those in the energy industry were advised to download the us army  marine corps counterinsurgency manual because we are dealing with an insurgency in the conference range resources spokesman matt pitzarella also said that range had several former psy ops folkswho are very comfortable in dealing with localized issues and local governments really all they do is spend most of their time helping folks develop local ordinances and things like that but very much having that understanding of psy ops in the army and in the middle east has applied very helpfully here for us in pennsylvania pitzarella later clarified that he meant to refer to one employee of the firm whose psy ops background made him adept at handling emotionally charged township meetings however sharon wilson the recorder of the remarks said the comments reveal what the fracking industry thinks about people in the communities that are impacted by the industry  public relations campaign regarding benefits of drilling to landownersedit in  as part of an effort to reassure the public of its activities range resources started a campaign my range resources which depict ordinary people who have benefited from allowing drilling on their land the ad campaign includes in the words of one centre daily times journalist bob myers real pennsylvanians talking earnestly about the wonderful experiences they’ve had with range resources according to elwin green of the pittsburgh postgazette range resources stands out because most gas companies generally prefer to keep a low profile preferring to tout their successes to wall street but not to main street in contrast range resources campaign uses testimonials such as natural gas has been  a godsend to this area from farmers or in the last two years probably  percent of our business is natural gas from local business owners vice president ray walker was quoted as saying a lot of people dont know much about our industry or about range resourceswere committed to being the very best that we can be we want to be accountable transparent and accessible to people videos produced by public relations firms big picture communications and downtowns animal inc used unscripted video and purposely avoided using company spokespeople blake lewis ceo of lewis public relations in dallas and a board member of the public relations society of america gave range resources website high marks however journalists reactions have been skeptical or mixed according to myers a quick review of the state department of environmental protection records suggests that the truth is more complicated than the ads suggestthe folks at range define good stewardship in a slightly different manner than is customary reg henry of the pittsburgh postgazette thought the whole promotion was skin crawling but now i read myrangeresources and i think how cute is that for a gas drilling company it makes me think of my daughter’s my little pony when she was a mite litigation and settlementsedit litigation regarding property damage in pennsylvaniaedit in  range resources reached a  settlement agreement with a pennsylvania family that alleged their acre farm had been destroyed by oil and gas development between  and  the pittsburgh postgazette sought to obtain court records related to the case when a judge ordered records unsealed the settlement agreement was initially not included in the  pages of records released the agreement itself was released after the postgazette and another newspaper the observerreporter sued to gain access as part of the settlement the family agreed to a gag order preventing them from talking about fracking for the rest of their lives the gag order covered not just the adults but also the children then aged seven and ten years old although the court transcript records an attorney for range resources saying that the order applies to the children and that the company would certainly enforce it the general counsel for range resources said otherwise after court records were unsealed in a  letter to the hallowichs attorney that was also released to the media the general counsel for the company said range has never at any time had the intention of seeking to hold a minor child legally accountable for a breach of that provision of the settlement agreement the lawyer for the hallowich family said range had waived the confidentiality of the agreement by releasing the letter to a cable network and that the family would seek judicial remedy litigation
