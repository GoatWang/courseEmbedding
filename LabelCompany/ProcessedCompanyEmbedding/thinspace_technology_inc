without any prerequisites however this opens up a new challenge for organizations as unknown and unmanaged devices including potentially harmful devices can connect to the corporate network moreover compliance becomes a challenge as it becomes impossible to enforce corporate policies to end users next generation ssl vpns like thinspace onegate bring strong device profiling features that measure and calibrate each endpoint connecting to vpn against the corporate policiesthinspace onegate provides a flexible policy framework for administrators to keep the corporate network safe from unclean devices by either keeping such devices out of network restricting them to a part of network or remediate them to be able to access network servicesas part of device profiling thinspace onegate can check for status of endpoint security software like antivirus firewall and antispyware os and software updates and compliance to endpoint configurations an intelligent cache wiper can clean the files and cache stored on the local hard disk by browsers or by users whether residing in temporary folders or any of the drivesalthough ssl vpns provide broader access capability which clearly enhances productivity it also inherently widens network exposure to uncontrolled environmentsfor example if a remote client machine is infected with viruswormstrojansspywares this unwanted traffic is also sent to private network over secured connection to effectively control these risks it is no longer enough to manage access by user identity alone the safety of the user’s endpoint environment must also be ensured by enforcing access policies based upon solid endpoint securitythinspace onegate administrators can create  types of product policiesantivirusantispywarefirewallthus ensuring the most recent versions are installed and active on the user’s device before they can connect to the network further to this administrator’s can create endpoint zones which override application groups limiting access to applications based on the result of the user’s device profile from the endpoint scan for example a ‘quarantine’ zone can be set to provide minimal access for noncompliant devices connecting to onegateonegate access can be further secured by enforcing mac address and ip address policies on the gateway the administrator can define a list of allowed or blocked addresses that are checked

support center     thinspace technology ltd is a global provider of application delivery desktop virtualization and cloud client technology solutions our technology enables it and service providers to manage and deploy secure application and desktop delivery solutions providing users instant access to applications on any device over any network or cloud what is cloud computing   cloud computing in a nutshell is a form of accessing and saving programs or data to a pool of shared computing resources eg the internet the ‘cloud’ andor private networks popular examples include google cloud platform amazon web services and apple icloud   an important aspect of cloud computing is the ability for users to access the same data from multiple devices ie broad network access using google as an example people and businesses can access google drive from desktops laptop tablets smartphones and other mobile devices essentially other google services can be placed in the same category as cloud computing such as google voice and gmail one of the great advantages of cloud computing for businesses and people alike is the reassurance of knowing that if you do lose a device or it crashes the cloud computing provider you’ve selected has this information andor application stored – and hopefully safely and securely – and can bring it back to your device of choice the catch is that you must have everything you wanted to salvage saved onto the cloud thinspace’s cloud computing software skyspace skypoint skydesk skygate and other products allows our enterprise customers and users the ability to access their desktop and applications such as mail files programs etc securely from anywhere in the world at anytime – easily efficiently and costeffectively thinspace’s cloud computing and application delivery solutions are crucial for it departments operating in multicountry and multioffice businesses and organizations users can easily access a document or program located on their desktop from anywhere in the world and use multiple devices to get to it   httpwwwthinspacecomskyspace   skyspace is a solution suite from thinspace comprising of hardware endpoint devices and management software that has been engineered to work together for the delivery of centralized desktops and applications skyspace has been designed to offer organizations a simple effective and

client storenothing architecture ensures that data leaks can never occur productive – deploy and control everything through skycontroller improving it productivity eliminating troubleshooting visits and downtime green – energy efficient ecofriendly thin clients used in place of pc hardware benefiting both the organization and the environment   how cloud computing can help your business   when it comes to cloud computing how much of it is beneficial to your business when compared to hardware and software programs the answer is – all of it here is how thinspace and other cloud computing providers can help your business   saves all of your data with cloud computing the “oh no” moment of data not being saved or recent edits not being seen is quickly resolved – because the issue never exists not only does cloud computing prevent loss of data but also it allows multiple users to update data universally – ensuring businesses and their employees have the most uptodate documentation when and where needed unlimited storage another big benefit of cloud computing and how it can help your business is the fact that you have access to as much storage as you ever want or need –  without having to scramble around at the last minute to purchase additional storage with digital data playing an increasingly large role in the world today it’s important for businesses to save their data – all of it – and have access to centrally located data storage when and where you need it provides  access cloud computing unlike hardware such as a pc allows you and your employees to save data and access it anywhere in the world moreover specialty providers like thinspace can even deliver your corporate desktop to a tablet or mobile device – anywhere in the world – at anytime thinspace users typically dispersed across a customers’ multiple office locations have  access to their data and desktop – and even a friendly support team on hand if they have issues saves time and money purchasing
