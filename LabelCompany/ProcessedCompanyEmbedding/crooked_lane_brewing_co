chemistry view slideshow  photos a rendering of crooked lane brewing co which will fill a prominent auburn building near… more then theres the third founder paul schilling the marketing dude who acknowledges the way science has influenced brewing its everywhere from the cleanliness of the process to following it to the letter he said if you think the founders background stories are interesting wait until you hear about the space crooked lane brewing co will occupy located at  grass valley highway its expected to open in the first half of  it fills a prominent building that has housed a movie theater a car dealership and even a martialarts dojo the site has been empty for about two years schilling said the brewerys operators will keep the columns located at whats currently the buildings front entrance theyll add greenery to the exterior fans can follow the brewerys progress on its facebook page dont expect a cramped tasting room the building covers about  square feet plus a squarefoot patio in addition the brewerys founders plan to have a beer garden with at least  square feet of space they expect the taproom will host trivia nights and include tvs the beer garden will feature special events with live music there are no immediate plans to serve food at crooked lane but the brewery will use food trucks its going to be very familyfocused schilling said creating a sense of community is a priority for the brewerys founders that includes using locally grown ingredients such as fruit and honey that are consistent with a farmtofork philosophy the founders will begin by offering at least six taps a number they say will eventually increase substantially schilling said the beer selection will offer an infusion of traditional european styles with a lower alcohol percentage than you might expect the brewery will also offer nonalcoholic craft root beer standard beer talk is fine but if you want to take things up a notch the scientists are game braun the brewery president with a background in biology will talk to you about yeast strains psuty the head of brewing operations with a background in chemistry will discuss the way a beers water profile impacts its quality and taste confused fortunately the story behind the brewerys name isnt as technical two of the founders live on crooked lane in newcastle there might not be a scientific formula to surviving in the increasingly crowded craft beer scene but theyre ready to take a chance a lone trophy remains in the space from its martial arts days the founders are thinking about incorporating it into the brewery as a piece of building lore or better yet a subtle suggestion that the venture will be a knockout sonya sorich is digital editor at the sacramento business journal she also oversees
