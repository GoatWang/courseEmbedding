standings video discuss bigger stronger travis sanheim a product of ron hextalls patience bigger stronger travis sanheim a product of ron hextalls patience by jordan hall  csnphillycom july    am voorhees nj — it was as if ron hextall was proclaiming the beauty of patience — that hallowed belief of the flyers’ general manager the sturdiest pillar to his rebuild at flyers development camp last week hextall illustrated his beloved patience by painting a picture his subject travis sanheim “travis is the best example coming in as an yearold” hextall said sanheim a  firstround pick of the flyers was just starting to bloom at the time he was a kid still growing into his body but that’s what the flyers liked far from an nhl physique that’s no longer the case with the yearold he’s on his way “sanheim was about  pounds when we drafted him” hextall said “and he has gained upwards of plus pounds” sanheim says he’s now between  pounds he cautioned that the added size is good weight — gaining muscle by proper nutrition and training it’s also “a process” that hasn’t come to fruition according to hextall “it’s taken a good two years now and it’s not done” he said “it’s probably going to take about four years to see travis’ strength develop to its maximum strength” sanheim agreed “i’ve definitely put on some weight and i think that’s something i said all along needed to happen” he said “i’ve been trying to put the work in eating right and trying to do everything with what i can to help me get stronger and bigger i think i’ve still got some work to do but i’ve definitely come a long ways” so at foot plus pounds sanheim’s still filling out — a scary thought given his current size is nothing at which to scoff even scarier considering his offensive game is already refined  following a point campaign in  games in  with the whl’s calgary hitmen sanheim accumulated  points  goals  assists last season despite playing  fewer games his  assists were second among all whl defensemen and his  points were fourth fellow flyers defensive prospect ivan provorov was first with  “offense is my game and something i want to continue to develop going forward and bring to the next level” sanheim said sort of like a certain someone with the flyers shayne gostisbehere the calder memorial trophy runnerup was the first of the flyers’ promising bundle of blueline prospects to crack the nhl once he did he took off with offense that left an impression on sanheim a dexterous defenseman like gostisbehere “he’s obviously offensiveminded as well and likes the skill side of the game” sanheim said “i think watching him and seeing him have success at that next level it definitely motivates us and gives us confidence in being able to play our game and play it at the next level” in all likelihood what’s next for sanheim is ahl affiliate lehigh valley where last season after finishing at junior he played four games tallying three points on a goal and two assists sanheim admitted speed wasn’t the biggest difference between junior and the ahl instead it was strength “just playing against men and having guys play you hard whether it’s you carrying the puck and them trying to get it off you or them having the puck and you trying to get it off them” he said “just how hard they battled and how hard it was to get the puck off them “to be able to get those games in at the end of the year i think is crucial for me going forward” so too is size it’s a prerequisite of hextall’s one sanheim is inching closer to fulfilling once he does he may not be far away from wearing a flyers sweater “all of these kids have to get bigger” hextall said “unfortunately you can’t just snap your fingers and put on  pounds because if you do then it’s not the right weight you’ve got to gain weight gain strength but also continue to keep your flexibility your mobility agility speed” hextall still remembers how sanheim looked when the flyers drafted him two years ago “he’s a skinny little guy not real strong but then you see him the first year after being drafted and notice that he is stronger” hextall said “he’s stronger on the stick defends better boxes guys out  “it’s amazing how quickly it happens but it has been two years for me that’s quick for most people that’s not very quick” no that’s patience — a beauty to hextall minor dealthe flyers on friday signed forward petr straka to a oneyear deal it will be the fourth season in the organization for straka who had  goals and  assists in  games last season with the lehigh valley phantoms straka spent three

philadelphia will be an exciting reality for hockey fans this season no danny briere isn’t coming out of retirement as the former flyers forward has committed to handling the daytoday operations of the organization’s newest echl team   however briere will be keeping close tabs on his younger son carson who’s currently on the philadelphia rebels man roster and is setting his sights on making the team’s final cuts during training camp “it’s great” briere said monday “growing up here for most of my life i love philly it’s fun getting to play in the same city that my dad did whenever i think of him playing i always think of that playoff run in  for the flyers” after spending the past two seasons at iceworks in aston pennsylvania the nahl’s north american hockey league rebels are moving their operation to the penn ice rink at the class of  arena where they made the formal announcement on monday it will be the organization’s third different home rink in the past four seasons after relocating from the rio grande valley in  “it was a nobrainer” team owner marko dundovich said “when the opportunity presented itself it was very easy i think it will give the boys a better opportunity to play get them seen and i think it’s going to continue to grow here and our business and organization will do much better here” the rebels and junior hockey simply didn’t attract a broad appeal in the philadelphia suburbs like ownership had hoped and as a result attendance lagged as the team typically averaged around  fans a game “it was the first time we tried junior a hockey here” dundovich said “if we had a   or person fan base we would have been ok in aston but i think it was tough to sell a junior hockey ticket in aston it’s a difficult sell in a small town”    conversely hockey fans in philadelphia haven’t had much of an alternative to the flyers since the phantoms left the city in  for glens falls new york rebels forward aaron maguyon who stays with former flyers captain keith primeau throughout the season feels the team cannot only fill the seat ice rink but the players will greatly benefit from the college vibe   “i think it prepares us for the future and playing college hockey for sure so in that way it’s like a sneak peek for what’s to come maguyon said i think it helps pull guys closer together we have restaurants we can go to or just activities we can do in the city according to the league website the nahl set a new singleseason ncaa record with plus commitments and the rebels had  commit to divison i programs head coach joe coombs has built a tierii junior hockey powerhouse over the past two years last season the rebels finished with the nahl’s best regularseason record advancing to the championship game of the robertson cup in duluth minnesota where they came up short in a  loss to the lone star brahmas  “this is business” coombs said “let’s bring the game to the people over the last two years we struggled with our attendance i didn’t even know this place was here — upenn hockey rink — and we couldn’t think of a better venue right here in university city to try and market our brand of hockey and bring our game to the
