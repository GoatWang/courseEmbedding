secretary donald e brown  cofounder chairman chief executive officer and president mike szilagyi joseph a staples  chief marketing officer and senior vice president of marketing gary r blough  executive vice president of worldwide sales paul weber stephen r head hi good afternoon this is steve head and were having an interactive analyst presentation our first presenter has not shown up yet i just want to let everybody know that thats out there on the webcast standing by that well start in a few minutes so well be right back with you shortly thank you okay were ready to get started with the interactive presentation hopefully everybody indiscernible music indiscernible having on hold ill start with a few introductions from interactive today i have ashley vukovits whos our vp of finance and meredith britt senior manager for financial reporting and a couple of folks from icr that we work with seth potter and emily burton at back there and so that will get it started the line up today starts with don with an overview of the company mike szilagyi will be in a few minutes kind of half an hour to talk about the caas operations hes going to talk about successes of joe staples to talk about some of the marketing things gary and paul on the sales part of the business we have a customer panel for  its from  to  so you can ask questions theyll give a little background of themselves and then give a chance to ask questions and well wrap up if theres any question from financials at the end i think most of you have stories i would be happy to answer any questions you have and with that well turn it over to don to begin the presentation donald e brown thanks steve well im just going go through a little overview of the company some of our results recently and more than anything else our plans for the future we had pretty strong results in  with orders increasing  revenues grew  to  million and our cloudbased orders increased  so i just believe that part of our business is growing pretty significantly cloud accounted for  of the orders up from  last year and generated  millionplus of cash overall the company generated that much cash we were able to gain many new highquality customers ranging from organizations like wellpoint deloitte tmobile auto manufacturers like toyota really every industry segment just right every geography around the world and there are a number of things driving our growth obviously one is the movement to the cloud a lot of companies wanting to get out of the it business as much as they can and so moving their operations to the cloud makes a lot of sense they see other companies do this with crm packages erp other types of applications so the move is really underway for communications in general and the contact center in particular weve been driven also by increasing recognition on the part of gartner frost  sullivan nemertes and other industry analysts and in fact our vp of marketing calls it the triple crown that we won last year where we improved our position in gartners leadership quadrant while being named contact center solution of the year singular by frost  sullivan in the north which is a big deal so that really is helping us in particular increasing our reputation with large organizations and so as and as steve was pointing out with some of the metrics that hell share were just doing a lot more large deals dealing with a lot more larger organizations some of whom were illustrated on the previous slide and this is the result of years of heavy spending in rd im a technical person so im a big believer and that is one of the primary catalysts of our growth and that has resulted in a rapidlymaturing product line that does more and more especially for large sophisticated organizations but also a product line that is broadening and deepening that is covering more functional areas and doing so in a more productive way and along with this is an increase in our global capabilities led by retailer acquisitions that weve done in key geographies like australia new zealand germany the benelux south africa so more and more we can go to a large multinational company and talk about supporting them not just with a network of resellers around the world but with our own direct operations in each geography so that has been instrumental to our growth and as a highend for  we have a number of objectives one is to continue rapid order growth of at least  and youve seen our first quarter numbers and were well on pace to achieve that we are going to continue to invest heavily in rd i think its roughly  of revenues that are being spent each year on rd which is quite a bit for a company our size but similar investments in sales and marketing allot more to our buildout of the cloud capabilities we still do want to maintain at least minimal nongaap profitability so were being pretty aggressive in our investment strategy but we dont want to throw caution to the wind so one useful metric is to say well at least maintain some modest nongaap profitability and we want to generate cash even with the move to the cloud so far weve been successful in making positive cash flow and so we are working to achieve that as well now every year with our employees we get together and put together a set of strategy points for the coming year and for  this includes going upmarket in the contact centers this has been  on our list for several years and has resulted in some of the large sales that weve gotten but weve got more we want to do both at the product level in terms of sales and marketing relationship with consultants analysts gartner and the like so we have a lot in store there were certainly going to grow our cloud business and that is the most rapidly growing segment of our business weve been very successful there but weve got a lot more that we intend to do within the cloud we primarily focus on the midrange and larger organizations but this year we decided to introduce a new offering for small centers those with somewhere between  and  agents we felt that we have reached the level of maturity with our caas offering that would allow us to go down into this smaller part of the market so we hired a new vp of sales we created a phonebased sales organization thats relatively small but growing and we made a significant marketing investment so this is the same thing the same caas service that weve been selling but repackaged for these small centers and so its a longterm investment its not going to move the financially needle much in  but we think it really does have a branding impact gets our name out in more deals and its something that can help us grow into larger deals and then as in previous years we intend to continue our geographic expansion especially in key geographies that includes canada the uk germany japan brazil australia new zealand and the benelux weve had some success already as well as direct operations in all these geographies so well continue to build those out and then were working to move current customers to cic  and thats a big part of what this conference is about showing the virtues of  showing customers how it improves their efficiency and profitability so that effort is already well underway but were doing everything we can to accelerate it at the show were releasing our new content management product that takes us into a new aspect of business process automation both inside the contact center but within the broader enterprise so were excited about that and were illustrating the buildout of our ecosystem as i tried to do earlier today in highlighting integrations we have with companies like orgspan nindev salesforce apple and video ph and then increasingly we are verticalizing weve been very strong in insurance the last several years and in other verticals like collections and utilities but we want to improve our strength in financial institutions like banks and credit unions we do have a lot of outsourcer customers but we have more that we want to do there and then in other industries like healthcare and vertical now im not going to spend a lot of time going through product plans because thats what this whole conference is about we could spend the next  hours i can bore you to tears just going through product details but at a high level weve got a lot of cool things that were introducing this week and working on in general one was the social customer service integration with orgspan that we showed this morning were working on increasing scalability and reliability as we go into those large organizations one key area for us is speech weve developed our own speech team last year introduced realtime speech analytics this year were incorporating speech recognition and texttospeech directly within our products and then we are maturing key parts of our product line to compete better with standalone products so the workforce optimization in particular with agent scheduling forecasting we made an acquisition last year of largely a mathematical group bay bridge analytics that has significantly increased our capabilities in this area and then quality monitoring is another one where we want to go headtohead with verint and nice organizations like that so that even our largest customers are able to make use of our quality monitoring capabilities were beefing up our multimedia more and more customers are looking for alternative channels into an organization so chat email sms video capabilities and then the business process automation move that we made about  years ago were extending with our ipa product via a web interface that can be used outside the contact centers by users who arent licensed for cic our new contact management  content management application and then trying to tie the whole together with much stronger data analytics including predictive analytics so thats a limited talk about the current product plans at least for the current product line but i do want to clue you in to our new effort that we have underway that we talked just a little bit about last year we had clayton christensen talk here at interactions and it was very interesting he talked about how a company will come along in a market and target a particular customer segment and customer segments typically tend to be multiple theyre highends and lowends that evolve overtime but a company will target one with a technology and often overshoot the needs of that particular segment of the market in focusing on it and they may allow a second company to start sometime lower targeting  sometime later targeting a lower segment of the market and initially the second company doesnt look like much of a threat but over time they grow to challenge the first company in its key markets because of their rate of growth and so in some ways this represents a situation  years ago with interactive intelligence against cisco avaya the nortel aspect and others we were the young upstart but what we worry about now is being in a position where we can serve increasingly the largest contact centers but that somebody else could come along and adopt changes in technology and really threaten our position and so what weve decided to do is to do that ourselves so we have initiated an effort called purecloud part of this stems from my involvement with orgspan where i was introduced to those guys who are doing leveraging amazon web services for the backend delivery utilizing open source technologies like mongo celery rabbit all these crazy names but basically linuxbased technologies that they could use for very rapid application development so we decided that we wanted to do something similar ourselves and so we have created and are ramping up an effort that were referring to as purecloud thats largely down the research triangle park area in north carolina and we think that we can get it to move at an even faster rate than what were able to with the current cic line and this is what were rapidly moving to its a pure cloudbased communication service in which the application services storage analytics those sorts of things are done up in the aws cloud which is the cheapest infrastructure available on earth customers can connect simply over the internet and for those who wanted to keep voice traffic local to their organization they can install a simple device a simple appliance that we call the edge device on their network that will handle telco connectivity but it also contains millions of lines of highlyoptimized c code that weve developed over the last  years so a lot of the lowlevel nittygritty stuff the complexity of voice not only telco connectivity but also fax conferencing ivr all the speech capabilities that ive mentioned increasingly video it will also contain a basic ip pbx and use rest api in order to talk via the internet to the services up in amazon so its meant to be something that we can ship out a customer they can provision from a web browser plug into their network and be operational in minutes and in addition to providing all those lowlevel voice capabilities it also acts as a remotely survivable device so in the event that the internet is unavailable or amazon is unavailable they can continue to operate locally routing calls taking and making calls recording providing ivr all their basic services so it really is the best of both worlds the application services are hosted up in amazon and they are multitenant we designed this for unlimited scalability using the elastic load balancer capability of amazon web services using amazon as freeforstorage and a whole wealth of rapidly evolving database and analytic capabilities that are springing up and being developed for amazon and then on the user interface side were developing completely web interfaces so that from a single website an organization can go sign up even swipe with a  or enter credit card information and be provisioned and operational in minutes with an agent interface realtime supervision a strong administrative interface and even using web rtc for audio and video if youre not familiar with web rtc its an effort being pushed by google that builds audio and video capabilities directly into the browser so chrome today has this capability for peertopeer audio and video communications that dont require any fancy or expensive videoconferencing equipment at all nothing more than what comes with the typical laptop and then well offer some other premisesbased options endpoints like ip phones from audiocodes and polycom the ipad supervisor that we showed this morning but well have components that allow them to screen recording and local integration as well so far ive shown local control where a customer wants the voice traffic to stay on their network the price they pay is theres got to be a device there that takes in the voice traffic in order to allow that voice to remain local some organizations dont want even that they dont want to have to do anything to their network install any device to their network and we will support that model as well we call that remote control in that case that edge devices are up in our data centers that we have around the world the application logic is still on amazon but this way the customer doesnt need anything  potentially anything at all other than maybe a chromeenabled laptop running within the contact center or their  or at home for remote agents so what this leaves us with is a couple of different product lines that will continue to evolve but that we think need a number of key customer needs in a way that nobody in the industry can match with cic and caas we can handle large complex customers either on premises or in a singletenant cloud even a private cloud the way we do for some of our customers that offers extremely high security data isolation its a little bit more expensive to operate takes a little bit longer to set up but it gives them the sort of control they want but on the other hand with purecloud well have this multitenant cloudbased solution that also offers good security but a little bit less control but also with a much lower operational cost which gives us flexibility on pricing or alternatively on the sort of operating margin that we can generate so you can see that both products are meant to handle a wide range of customers with purecloud were actually aiming to be able to go really across both ends of the market from the very smallest organizations all the way on up to the very largest and were convinced we can do that the way we see cic caas playing out is largely a focus on incremental improvements increase in scalability with some functionalities that well add like a cloudbased version of ipa intelligent pay analytics some more sophisticated routing and then purecloud we think youll see evolve very rapidly this year is the development year we intend to release it next year primarily focused at inbound contact centers but over the next couple of years beyond that we will grow it up to handle inboundoutbound multimedia contact centers and really organizations of just about any size so with those  efforts we think that weve got a pretty good range of options that leave us in a good position with a very experienced technicallyadept company with a good and growing reputation a cloud story thats unrivaled because we can offer a range of options that nobody else can and that allows us to service a broadening market set of options for  and we really believe potentially a marketshattering solution in  thats my presentation any questions i can answer for you yes sir questionandanswer session unknown analyst indiscernible donald e brown so the question is around small center and how that fits in with purecloud and how we avoid cannibalization as we bring purecloud to market well just to emphasize the small center solution is something we have today that were rolling out today using current technology clearly next year we will take a hard look at transitioning over those small center accounts  new small center accounts and have them utilize purecloud partly just for operating efficiency because as i keep emphasizing the  we believe well have a better operating margin with purecloud than we currently are able to get today with our virtualized approach were not too worried about cannibalization at this point for one thing its not clear that well price purecloud in a cannibalistic way we have that option which well examine the market but the purecloud really just is a different sort of option that will appeal to certain types of customers but that decreased operating cost we think will give us the flexibility to lower costs to survive a price war if one does emerge that we just think were going to be in very very good shape but at least initially were not at all concerned about customers adopting purecloud over cic if they do thats fine it actually is more profitable for us at the current level yes sir unknown analyst indiscernible donald e brown so the question is what happens with caas as purecloud goes along does purecloud eventually replace it the real answer is we dont know at this point what we see is a market thats somewhat fragmented i met with a customer and a prospect then in the uk a few months ago it was a retailer and started to talk about cloud and the guy almost physically stopped me and said i dont want to hear about cloud what we do is weve had an aspect system that weve owned for  years we amortize it thats done we want to own it we want to get every bit of value out of it that we can and then well buy something else and well do the same thing and they end up buying our solution and buying the premisebased version so we see going forward some customers who are like that who want to own it theyve got the it staff they want the level of control that a premisebased solution offers some customers like the idea of cloud but only so far they really like the multi  the singletenant virtualized solution that we offer today because they get the benefit of pushing some of the it work onto us but yet they dont have to worry about being mixed in with a bunch of other companies they can upgrade on their own schedule they still have some measure of control they still have great security and weve made some very large sales using that configuration all right so its really difficult for me to see either of those going away anytime soon but we do believe that there is an important market for a multitenant solution so well be putting a fair amount of resource in there the way we designed this from a development standpoint there is a lot of intellectual property that lies in common really that serves all  of those so in particular today we have our media server component where we have a tremendous amount of intellectual property for that lowlevel treatment of voice speech conferencing all that stuff i mentioned were putting video resources in there that really becomes this edge device so this edge device will be something that we will use for premisebased deployments for caas singletenant deployments for purecloud and thats a huge portion of our intellectual property so we think we can  and there are other areas i wont go into where we can develop common code for analytics web portals mobility social media lots of other things that will be really the same code for all  of those offerings and we will just let the market determine how this will all shake out i dont know if we reach the point that  of customers are fine with a multitenant solution and we feel that we could forgo that part of the market that wouldnt be accepting such a solution then maybe we would make that step but i think thats probably a good  to  years out before we really begin to have a firm notion of whats going on yes sir unknown analyst indiscernible donald e brown okay the question was about competition at the lowend and the highend i guess to be frank we really havent seen much of a change the last couple of years we see some of the players at the lowend in contact and some of those sorts of organizations that have largely taken premisebased solutions and then tried to readapt them for a cloud world and im a little bit more familiar with incontact i know that for example for quality monitoring they resell the verint product rather than developing their own and so its a distinct advantage for us to develop these core technologies ourselves we can integrate with thirdparty solutions where customers really require them but thats becoming less and less of a  less and less common as we mature our own products in areas of workforce optimization quality monitoring we really havent seen anybody  any of the large players come out with a compelling cloud offering yet for the most part they tend to be working with various hosting providers  in hosting theyre premisebased solution so not a whole lot has changed that we can see but were not about to stay in that past we feel very good where we are today and we think our growth numbers show that we are taking market share away from just about everybody else in the current cloud area but we dont want to just count on that forever and thats why we went ahead and made the financial investment took the financial hit we could have been far more profitable this year if we had wanted to be but we decided to siphon off  million or more more toward this new effort that were really excited about that wont help us at all this year it just hurts us this year but we really feel positions us extremely well for the future okay unknown analyst indiscernible donald e brown we dont have anything that we can share yet were still  the question was operating margin difference between say caas and purecloud we dont have any firm numbers that we can share yet i will just say that with caas we go out open up a new data center and mike szilagyi who is sitting back there wants me to sign a check for a  million thats our depreciation thats our investment depreciation that weve got to pay we pay the electricity the connectivity all those charges there the people costs associated with maintaining those data centers weve felt that it was necessary in order to get into this game but theres no question that it hurts our overall profitability with purecloud were designing this from the ground up to leverage amazon web services so that we can turn up those services incrementally and automatically it really is a wondrous thing to see and ive seen it as i said through orgspan this incremental increase that can be done the provisioning can be done automatically so that you need much less in terms of human intervention and human capital back there as an expense and you pay by the drink for exactly what you need the cpu the storage the connectivity so we dont think we can beat amazon in terms of overall data center efficiency im not sure anybody can so just intuitively we know that were going to get quite a costsavings as we move to that architecture stephen r head thank you don and next up speaking cloud were giving a lot of time on we have mike szilagyi our vice president of our caas operations mike mike szilagyi good afternoon everyone my name is mike szilagyi im the vice president of our communications as a service group so im responsible for the technology the engineering the support and the delivery of the services for our caas offering worldwide today id like to share with you some of the progress that weve made over the last couple of years in our existing caas platform around the world and then also share some of the deployment strategies that we have and some of the numbers of our customer base as well so id like to first start by giving you an update on where we are with our data centers don mentioned some of the locations that we went into and now id like to share some of that with you and also talk about some of the deployment models that were doing right now and what gives us an advantage in the marketplace with those flexible deployment models you heard don talk about local control and remote control and there are quite a few customers out there that that is important to them they are not ready to jump  into the cloud and some of our models really give them the flexibility to meet their needs as well as compliance compliance is an important part of them as well and its  and for me its the last hurdle for the cloud is companies have to be comfortable with you managing their data so we have some of our deployment models that give us some flexibility there as well and id also like to talk about some of the tiered service offerings that weve introduced so at the beginning of this year weve launched different platform tiers that come with different feature sets different support and different service models as well and then finally ill talk about some of the customers and seat counts that we have so this shows you where we interactive intelligence has offices around the world and what id like to do is overlay on there where we have our data centers and why do we have them in those locations so here are the ones that we currently have we broke the world off into  different parts so we have japan and australia at separate units we have the emea region south america and the united states we have  data centers in each of those locations and the customers today are pretty savvy even though were talking about the cloud they know that their data and their services are sitting in a data center somewhere they want to know that theres business continuity and disaster recovery thats the  centers youll be seeing though what happened with hurricane sandy and the tornado in japan these data centers arent susceptible and theyd like to know that their data is secured in  data centers so in each part of this world  each part of the world here we have  centers that satisfy that need in indianapolis indiana we have our global noc a noc is a network operations center so this is where we monitor all the equipments throughout the world in our data center we have the staff   with engineers that are there monitoring equipment and doing all the proactive maintenance that may come up or proactive monitoring so if theres something thats happening on the customers infrastructure within our data center even if its on redundant or spare parts were able to see it and proactively take measures the white circles that just came in are places where we actually have technical operations support and staff so we have engineering and support and services in all the locations where we have data centers as well these are staff senior engineers that are managing the infrastructure they are support engineers that are working with our customers taking the level  calls and service engineers for those that are live and require ongoing assistance with our product to help configure their ivrs in their contact center services or their pbx services still yet to come we still  our facility evolving and advancing this network of data centers later this year in the second half of this year well be opening  centers in canada to service that market as well  well be opening  center in toronto and  in montréal as well and we will be expanding our global noc and opening a center in malaysia that will have   on that side of the world as well after that i wont ask don for another  million check so in each of these data centers its an important component for us to have a strong security and compliance story theres a lot of procurement departments out there that are asking the same questions theres cloud security alliances that are forming where customers are becoming educated and they understand what to ask for their vendors that are in the cloud they want to understand that you have policies that they are vetted by a thirdparty organization and they do meet some public standards so this is our story we have a corporate story as well that judges our corporate entity how we develop software and its covered by sox and iso and then jitc for the government sector all base on an iso  standards then you move into the cloud services so my team and what we do so we have a standard called ssae that governs and dictates how we perform our maintenance how we manage our infrastructure how do we manage whos coming into the environment and what theyre doing and have accountability for those things were also working on our pci specification as well for our customers that handle credit card data so well have the pci environment for those as well and then you move on to our data centers we dont actually build the data centers ourselves we use colocation providers but theyre all tier  or tier certified data centers throughout the world and they also have a set of standards that they  theyre mainly governed by what their power systems look like how they provide the power how they secure  physically secure access to the infrastructure as well so those are  things together give us a very strong security message to our potential clients that have those types regulations or concerns about the cloud next i want to move onto our deployment strategy so we have what is we call remote control its where is the telephony is remote from the customer and this is what is typically referred to as the purecloud deployment model so the lower half of this  the bottom part of the screen is the customer location so they have a physical handset phone their agents and their desktop pcs and in the cloud is where we host all of our application software we connect down to the customer premise site using mpls and in some cases the internet and we manage and maintain that all of the applications in our cloud as well as the telephony services components the other model is more of the hybrid model that we call local control so the telephony components and even some of the media processing and the management of the recordings and the telephony can stay at the customers sites and this helps us in a couple of situations one where they have an investment in equipment say a pbx of a telephony system that they would still like to take advantage of or if they have some kind of compliancy that says that their recordings and their data must stay local to their site with our local control model were able to facilitate that and take some of the management of our applications and the complexities of that and move it into the cloud and again we still get the business continuity and disaster recovery of the  data centers and then we deliver all that sitting behind our fives sla so it gives them comfort that we can focus on our application while they can still leverage some of their existing equipment at their site as well as meet their compliancy objectives that they have with their business a new offering that don mentioned was the small center so this is very similar to remote control with the exception that everything is delivered over the internet so were using secured voice channels over the public internet to deliver our services to small customers  agents and under and at the customer site they can have a softphone or a voiceoverip phone connected to our system as well as our client applications so wed manage everything up in the cloud we limit the feature set that they can  that theyre delivering keep the complexity down and bring them into service within  days we have a day guarantee that we can bring them up and running within that time period heres the standard  the edition that weve began offering at the beginning of this year so weve taken  when people look at the cloud everybody has different needs from their cloud vendors down at the small center its basic functionality small number of agents limited feature set and then as you move to the far right its more complex larger customers that have advanced needs and need specialized customizations to meet their requirements or meet their workplace needs so weve introduced these different tiers here that of course have different pricing functionality associated with them and each of the tiers as you move from small center the left to the right they have the functionality of the previous edition plus some additional added benefits so if you look at the standard edition its got some simplified available options of supervisor reporting and multichannel and then the preferred edition if you look at that we added even some more functionality there and each of this contains some level of increased support and services from us as an organization as well so if you  and in the far right is the premium were you start to introduce things like voicexml natural speech recognition things that are a little more complex to set up maintain and manage as don mentioned earlier we are seeing  we are making an investment in caas and were starting to see the benefits of that investment from  at  of our percentage of total orders to an estimated of  of our orders in  as far as our seat count again a nice trajectory starting back in mid surpassing the  seat mark and seeing a nice trajectory growth there as well and you can see its a mixture of agents business users stations and supervisors as well if you look at our deployment models that we talked about there remote control and the local control you can see its about a  split out there in the marketplace so it is satisfying the need of our customers there are certain customers that local control is the perfect model for them and theres others that theyre more comfortable with the cloud and theyd like to move more of that services and functionality so we are seeing a nice adoption rate from both of those models within the marketplace the lower chart  the pie chart on the lower side there shows where we are with our geographic deployment now this is  if you think about the cloud in north america and specifically out of our us data centers we do have multinational companies that are running out of our us data centers so we have some that have offices all around the world using local control but their application is actually running in our us data centers so that particular chart shows the region in which that we have data centers that companies running out of that location so were starting to see our investment in emea and apac and now latin america start to see the  were starting to see the benefit of that investment as well as we see those pipelines grow and you can see that there is a pretty nice adoption rate out there from customers some wellknown customers out there are looking to the cloud first when it comes to their procurement model so we have seen some good success there as well on the smallend and the highend across both our deployment models so we feel like weve got a really nice offering right now that can meet a lot of needs weve made the investments that we need in the security and the compliance to win in different vertical markets such as finance healthcare government sectors and then weve also made an investment on the small centers to help some of those  to help bring some of our technologies down to the smaller market that typically couldnt afford those in the past any questions for me yes unknown analyst indiscernible mike szilagyi i think at some point there itll be  im sorry the question was is there a clear migration path for the small center customers to the purecloud and i think at some point its going to be  the feature set well have that it provide the impetus for them to move over to the purecloud at some point the feature set of the purecloud will be  or the price point when we determine what those price points may be will be the impetus to help do that but we  as we develop the features in the purecloud well certainly keep that strategy in mind we do have between the tiers that we have in our caas offering right now weve got a nice strategy for letting them move to the next levels when they do need that increased feature set so well apply the same techniques when we develop the purecloud unknown analyst indiscernible mike szilagyi the question was talk about the adoption of the cloud in the financial sector  oh in the federal sector the federal sector is of course has quite a few compliance need that dictates who they do business with were certainly looking at those we have the jitc on our premisebased so we know that we can  the application can be secured to work for the government we have the right encryption levels we have the right features in our software so now its a matter of taking those standards and applying it to our data centers so were focusing on the base foundation first which is our ssae that will put an iso  standards state practice on our organization and from that well start building on the different vertical segments the first one that weve approached is pci we do see quite a few retailers out there that are interested in the cloud and pci is a requirement for them because they do process credit card information so well focus on that we also have a group thats looking at some of the government sector as well high tech is one of their standards that theyre pursuing for cloudbased services so it depends its a little bit different at the local levels as well as the federal levels we do have a couple of local level customers local government customers on caas right now yes unknown analyst indiscernible mike szilagyi sure sure the question was could you talk a little bit about the private cloud and what the demand is for the private cloud yes private cloud is  it has a couple of different requirements that produce some private cloud there are certain companies out there that because of their business practices they like to see an airgap solution so they dont want any of their data or any of their equipment intermixed with anybody else so nothing is shared so we have customers that are required as pure  just private cloud and we use our standard architecture that we use for our regular caas and deploy it for them give them an environment in which they can grow and also extend them the ability to do customizations so there are certain things that they want to do with their business practice to give them a competitive edge that is just too demanding for our standard environment so we like to isolate them as well and give them flexibility to do the things that they need to do without impacting other customers so it works for us and it works for them as well unknown analyst indiscernible mike szilagyi its been pretty consistent weve seen theyre hugely focused on larger customers that are either in the financial or healthcare industry or i imagine the government sector as well where they do have those strong compliancy associated with them yes unknown analyst indiscernible mike szilagyi the question was have we disclosed the largest seat deployment for our caas offering steve do you know if we have stephen r head indiscernible mike szilagyi i have not disclosed it it is we have active customers that are over a couple of thousand agents now we have some in contract that are coming up around  and some of that are targeting over  over multiple years unknown analyst indiscernible mike szilagyi correct okay any other questions okay thank you stephen r head thanks mike next presenter today is joe staples our chief marketing officer and im turning it over to joe joseph a staples all right cant see upclose with glasses on so ill take them off so heres the pieces that i was going to cover one i wanted to talk about the marketing mission which i think will give you some flavor for how we go to market what our emphasis is how were spending our marketing dollars next is a bit about branding third is something that we call influencing the influencers and ill give you more detail about that i then thought id give you an update on our strategic relationships the partnerships that we have there and then finally ill wrap up with at least my view and it really will be kind of one data point but my view of the competitive assessment what were seeing going on in the competitive landscape and hopefully well have a couple of minutes for questions at the end so from a marketing standpoint what we task our marketing employees with is really to focus on  areas and focusing on those  areas means that we tell them dont focus on things that fall outside of that oftentimes you can get marketing teams to get wrapped up in helping hr do various things because weve got graphic designers and we have a creative people wed say no this is the box that you get to color in so its a building brand awareness generating sales leads that then get passed to our sales team creating effective sales tools to help them close those deals for those leads that we gave them and then finally i think our group is in somewhat of a unique position to provide some good input into the development of the products and services that we produce for a couple of reasons one is we deal a lot with industry analysts and consultants and we have quite a bit of interaction with customers and so taking all of that input back into the development organization is a pretty core part of what we do so starting with brand building this is an interesting one and we certainly have  i think impressed the industry analysts with this we hold a quarterly web event where we produce a minute  i mean a  hour and minute webcast on an educational topic so things like migrating to the cloud social media in contact center contact center consolidation mobile customer service and we promote the heck out of this and here you can see the registration numbers that we draw so on average we get about  registrants to these each quarter and i say that we get kind of the applause from industry analysts thats because nobody else  you think of the people we compete with the size of cisco and avaya they dont draw anywhere near these kinds of crowds so weve cracked the code weve got some promotional partners we built the topic in a certain way we extended its  hour and  minutes we do about a minute qa we utilize or rely heavily on industry analysts and consultants to participate with us and it really draws an effective crowd if you think of the contact center space and some of the largest contact center live events inperson trade shows they dont have  or  or  attendees at those so i think were doing something right there we launched the new website a big part of our branding is around our website we continue to drive and push traffic there we think that thats a good vehicle for us to generate brand awareness and also to increase the conversions of people downloading assets and us converting those into leads social media were active participants in the social media sphere and its certainly an opportunity for us to get our brand out so you can see some of the numbers  twitter followers  video views on our youtube channel followers on linkedin over  so weve got a dedicated resource that focuses on our social media strategy and then the field marketing manager spread spread around the world also are pretty active in that space print ad campaigns so print ad world has changed dramatically since ive been a marketer print advertising was the way to get branding now theres hardly any magazines to actually advertise in anymore and we do most of our spend in the digital world where were online but we do think that theres some real opportunity to get our message out in some of these key publications and there are some that are very specifically targeted at our audience so to give you of an idea of kind of the messaging and what were putting out i thought id share with you a brief sample of some of the ads so weve got  different campaigns well typically run a campaign consistently through a publication before we shift into another campaign and each campaign will have anywhere from  ads to  ads so it kind of depends on which one youre looking at so the first ones called better than or think of it as the second one focuses on our differentiators for our caas business third focuses around customer experience which ill tell you from a messaging standpoint i think thats the one thing that youre going to see more and more from us is as we transition our business from much more of a technology play and a focus on the technology to much more of a solutions play where what were doing is helping our customers deliver this great experience to their customers youre going to see more of that get credited into our messaging and into the action that our employees make and then the fourth one is a graffiti campaign and ill  hopefully all of those will become evident as you take a look at these so i think i just have  or  samples of each so on better than or think of it as the concept is to take something thats relevant to just about every reader and then put a twist on it that puts it into the context of either unified communications or the contact center so in this case better than an alternate route in a traffic jam and the copy talks about there are a number of different ways that customers can contact your business voice email chat fax social media and then it ties into the message that we have around our multichannel communication a couple of other things that you see very similar in all of the ads in all of the campaigns a very dominant brand interactive intelligence kind of slaps you in the face you dont have to go look for that a lot of that is based on where we are at with our brand recognition we have a long way to go so were not in a position to kind of subtly put a nice little interactive mark down at the bottom so we kind of need to slap them in the face with it and then certainly with some of these more abstract ads we want to make sure that people are able to quickly discern look its interactive intelligence and what do they do and so youll see this ribbon reused in just about all the ads that we do so it fits on our  main offerings contact center unified communications and business process automation and then makes it clear that we do this cloudbased or onpremise the caas differentiator ad this is an example of one of those we went through and we have key messages associated with each product and in the case of caas there are certain things that the cloud does better than an onpremise offering and then certainly certain things that we do better with our cloud offering than what our competitors do those main messages are likely communicated in these ads so this one is on flexibility and how much more flexible our caas offering is in allowing people to ramp up users pull down on users based on seasonality those types of things so you can see its a single word this one talks about how you can get a faster deployment quicker timetodeploy with caas security talks about our trust factor and how secure our solution is which is becoming more and more of a competitive differentiator for us customer experience again this one really speaks much more to the experience of the customer than the technology behind that so that the headline there its not about you its about your customer really tries to resonate with the chief customer officer the person running the contact center that may not be down in the operational piece but knows that they have a mandate to increase customer satisfaction scores create greater retention for customers and repeat buyers and then the last campaign is  we call it the graffiti campaign but very conveniently allows us to take just about any message we have paint it on a wall or on a rock and voila youve got an ad so this one starts off with our allinone solution and the copy then ties people into what the meaning of allinone is what the benefits are again commonality from the standpoint of a nice big branding of our logo mark and name and then the ribbon that distinctively talks about what we do so theres one on roi again it makes the creation of ads pretty easy you just kind of come up with a new way of actually displaying it influencing the influencers this is one that i believe over time will continue to grow for us and really has a big big impact on our business if you rewound the clock  or  years ago we could hold a meeting with the consultants and analysts that we had relationships with we could hold the meeting in the mens room i mean it was just about never in fact we were in a position where if a consultant came into a deal we kind of cringed we didnt like it because we didnt have relationships with any of them they didnt know about us very much and so they tended to point the customer in a different direction so over the last  really over the  about the last  years weve really looked at who influences business in our space and how can we influence them not influence them in a coburglar or bribery kind of a way but certainly the thing thats kind of a nobrainer is if theyre uneducated on your products and services theyre not going to bring you up because a customer asks some more questions they look ignorant its a bad deal for them so our initiative was twofold lets identify who are those influencers who are those people that the customers are going to and saying its time for us to replace our contact center infrastructure and what should we do so who are those people and then second lets spend time and effort and money to educate them so that they can  when the fit is right that they can point that customer to us so share a few things with you starting with kind of who those influencers are certainly theres the larger industry analysts so gartner we spend a lot of time with them frost  sullivan dmg consulting it is very big in the cloud contact center space ventana research theres a lot in europe ovum is kind of the data and analytics for our industry forrester frost  sullivan all influence deals and so we spend time with them but then going beyond that there are these small boutique consultant organizations that are engaged maybe in just  or  projects a year but theyre the ones that are telling customers heres what makes sense for you heres what i recommend heres what i suggest heres what you should buy and so we want to make sure that they know and understand us well so currently we have over  consultants active in our consultant outreach program where we are pushing information to them at least on a monthly basis but very often more often than that so new product releases new opportunities to learn about our products here at this conference i believe we have  consultants analysts handful of members with the media that are here we look at that and say if we can get them to sit here and kind of drink the interactive intelligence punch for  days theyre going to walk away certainly advocates more than they had been in the past consultantinfluenced interactive intelligence revenue and this is important and this is only the stuff that we know about so as weve gone back through and looked at closed deals deals that where we won contracts that had consultants engaged in them how much was that and you can see the numbers  the calendar years are a little bit different but pretty much a single year here in north america and then in emea and if you kind of look at our business and you take how much is product sales compared to the services piece and how much of that is new sales those numbers become a pretty good chunk of what were doing and then in  we really kind of keyed back on the success that weve had in north america and we formally launched consultant liaison programs in emea australia new zealand and in japan so weve hired consultant liaison managers in those international regions again going through the process of recruiting consultants into this outreach program okay the market projections piece always something that i think tends to interest you you hear a lot about the cloud and mike just shared all the great things that were doing in the cloud this graph tells you why thats where were putting our emphasis so the blue bar shows cloudbased contact center agent position growth and the red bar shows premisebased contact center agent position growth so to be in a market thats growing at  compared to being in a market thats growing at almost  makes sense for us i love this quote so this is from dmg consulting most of this growth is the result of increasingly broad acceptance of the cloudbased delivery model in contact centers endusers are simply finding it more convenient to acquire cloudbased contact center infrastructure solutions i mean in  it was a lot of evangelism on our part and i for one thank you salesforcecom i mean they converted a lot of people to the cloud they helped people say you know what maybe this isnt as painful as i thought maybe it isnt as scary as i thought and so companies like that that forged the way for us we still have a lot of evangelism to do and we still have some evangelism to do but as dmg shows it really is getting broader and broader acceptance i think if we got the  consultants and analysts that are here with us in the room and said what would you tell your prospects about going to the cloud i believe every single one of them would say if youre making a contact center choice you have to consider the cloud i think every single one of them would also say the cloud isnt for everyone but the recommendation thats coming from these consultants and analysts is you need to consider it its strong enough of an offering that you need to consider it okay the competitive landscape this will be  in the time that we have well kind of cover these pretty rapidly but lets start with the traditional guys so cisco avaya genesys and aspect lets start with the easiest one first which is aspect i just came from a session presented by a thirdparty analyst who said that he or she was planning on speaking at the aspect customer conference next week and said that they could fit the people at the aspect customer conference in a room that was probably about  times this size so a pretty small group i mean thats  theyre a pretty easy competitor for us to beat the other thing that this person disclosed was her conversation with the new ceo of aspect which was hey my take is youve got about  year to turn this thing around or sell it into these parts and according to her she said that the ceo said yes thats about right so anyway theyre somebody that we dont see very often anymore and theyre absolutely somebody that we wont lose to cisco i think one of the most interesting pieces there is ciscos actually starting to make a push into the cloud and weve  i think rightfully so we believe that in part that is based on the success that were seeing and the reaction to that so theyve launched a cloud contact center product in january of this year their preference we believe is to sell their premisebased offering i think their gotomarket is different than us one of the things that we did early on was to say you know what were not going to rely on a thirdparty to deploy our cloud solution were going to bite the bullet were going to invest in the data centers and were going to kind of control our own destiny with this thats a bit different than the tact that cisco is taking on the premise side with cisco we still see the contact center being left for later at the cisco sales team so theyll go in and theyll sell and enterprise unified communication solution and the contact center will come up and oftentimes the cisco people will say lets deal with that later because they dont want to slow down what can be a pretty big deal for them on the uc side and i think were the benefactors of that well come back in and say you know what because you have ciscouc deployed doesnt mean cisco is your only choice for the contact center and if we can get in there wed do well avaya also making some announcements relative to cloud offerings but we think its completely defensive but it is if ive got to do this if youre making me do it well figure out a way of deploying it for you but not core to their strategy and certainly not where they see their growth happening on the premise side the market share that they have and incumbency are the  things that they have going for them more than really than anything else genesys who as you know came out from under the alcatellucent umbrella and now owned by a private equity firm probably the most interesting dynamic for them is i saw a picture of the executive team at genesys so  people that was taken a year ago and in that picture there are now  of those  that are still there so i think theyre still going through quite a bit of churn they do use some things in the cloud our ability to beat them is mainly focused around the architecture of our offering compared to theirs they do a nice job in very complex environments and we think they can present a much more straightforward option when somebody is looking for multichannel acd routing and queuing and predictive dialing some of the newer guys that were certainly seeing more and more often as we sell more cloudbased offerings would be x who acquired contactual five and incontact the contactual offering from x really is something that we bumped into with our caas small center offering its really designed and theyre  they will even tell customers that their client was designed for those small contact centers so well see them down with caas small center but never see them up in these larger deals five scales up a little bit higher but again we see them mainly in the small ones incontact is one that we see a lot of if we looked at differentiation between us and them first of all our size our financial strength would be one that our salespeople would use the fact that we have the technology that we deploy for customers is our own they rely on others as an example verint on the workforce management side they rely on a thirdparty for their predictive dialer so theyre  we see them in more deals but were pretty confident as we go up against them that we can win another quote from dmg consulting and this one really goes to the cisco avaya genesys aspect folks dmg does not believe that the premisebased contact center infrastructure vendors are positioned to do anything to prevent their customers from moving to the cloud which is thats their objective i mean if they had their wish if it was a birthday cake and they got to blow out the candles it would be lets make this cloud stuff go away because its breaking their business model and as dmg says its not going to happen this thing is moving in that direction and there isnt anything they can do to stop it so in some defensive format theyre having to figure out okay how do we adapt and then key strategic alliances so ill give you a brief snapshot of each of these microsoft so were a close partner with them on where we run in the contact center and microsoft lync runs in the enterprise it changes our sales strategy when we go in with microsoft we tell a bit of a different story to a customer were very willing to concede the enterprise fees with business telephony piece to them theyre our partner going in and well take the contact center weve got i believe about  sales of cic integrated with microsoft lync one of the analysts thats year jim burton ph says that that is more than any other vendor so that puts the  into somewhat of contacts there salesforce you saw the demo this morning of our integration there were doing some cool things with them to be able to do keyword analysis and fire off chatter sessions and pull information out of their database as an organization salesforce is a bit more challenging for us to navigate their business is growing theyre kind of focused on their own thing so the collaboration of them bringing us into deals us bringing them into deals is less than it is just  theyre deployed in a lot of places we go in and we show our salesforce integration as a competitive differentiator against competitors who either dont have one or have one thats not as wellbuilt ibm a long relationship with them they actually resell our products and were seeing them bring us into some significantsized opportunities oracle we think weve got the closest partnership with oracle of any contact center vendor weve actually integrated with  different product lines of theirs so oracle siebel the cx cloud service which was the rightnow piece and then a new offering called oracle fusion and we have integrations done and complete with the first  and well under development on the one with fusion and finally polycom used for the endpoints with our solutions and polycom just has a  a a broad reach out into the market and b theyve got a great name theyre nicely respected as a company when it comes to end customers and so collaboration between our sales team and their sales team tends to open up doors and allows us to find some new opportunities all right weve got  minutes questions unknown analyst indiscernible joseph a staples i dont think were seeing  im going to answer the last one first i dont think were seeing cisco hardly at all but i think we recognize that that will change i mean theres some competitors on there that i  so aspect as an example i told you we hardly ever see them a year from now i dont think well hardly ever see them cisco i think we will see more and more i think that they have come to the point where they say we believe that the cloud piece is going to take off and is moving and theyre doing something about it so i think well see more of them differentiators with incontact certainly the size of the deal comes into play incontact has been pretty hesitant in disclosing publicly their average deal size but we know that a bulk of their stuff gets sold into what would compete with our caas small center opportunities so if the opportunity is sizable well line up large deal after deal after deal and believe that theyre coming in with relatively few references there from a technology standpoint theres the concept that  im not getting too technical here but that we run on isolated virtual machines for every customer incontacts a multitenanted environment and we believe theres some security differences there and then the one  the other one that i mentioned was that we own all of that technology we developed it and arent relying on third parties for core pieces like predictive dialing or workforce management unknown analyst indiscernible joseph a staples so if you look at our traditional competitors and how we compare to them thats what im doing and how we compare to them in our marketing activities relative to theirs they outspend us so we underspend them thats one big difference i think some of the things that weve done differently than them is weve focused on a lot of content marketing and thought leadership so we produced even given the relative size difference we produced a lot of educational material if you look at those web events that we drive prospects to we never sell  were not talking to them about anything that has anything to do with our product we never say and with cic you can do this were talking to them about relative concepts in terms and things that they grapple with from an education or a thought perspective and i think we do that better than the people that we compete with and i think the other thing is weve got a bit more of an edge to us from the standpoint of theyre very traditional i mean big iron avaya can trace its roots back  years theyre traditional big vendors and weve been able to differentiate ourselves as more innovative more flexible easier to do business with we had a panel discussion at lunch today with  customers on the panel and one of them said  the question was asked how did they select interactive intelligence and one of them essentially said it was how nimble and flexible they were as a vendor and i thought man if you got that as a message hallelujah because thats the message that were trying to send unknown analyst indiscernible joseph a staples yes so then its interesting so the question is how do we compare to the people that are trying to disrupt us the nice thing is weve been there because we went through that innovators dilemma and weve disrupted those big guys so we know what  how the game is played but the world has changed i mean then were standing up and were saying  customers were talking about intuit and philips and motorola and all of these big wins and were trying to position ourselves as the safer choice in some of those prospects mike ph do you have a question unknown analyst indiscernible joseph a staples i dont know i think that there are a number of small companies that we probably dont even know about that are disrupting us or trying to disrupt us that i probably couldnt pinpoint or name one yes unknown analyst indiscernible joseph a staples so the question is how much of the market is influenced by consultants its all dependent on size so as we go upmarket if we look at a  one of the benchmarks that we always use is a  deal there will be a consultant in that deal the majority of the time in a  million deal there will be a consultant or an analyst in there every single time so as we go upmarket they are absolutely in there a large large portion of the time down to lowerend caas small center  agents and below people arent going to pay for consultants so this has been an important part of our strategy as we move that market unknown analyst indiscernible joseph a staples the mix between customers and prospects is probably about  customers so we got a nice group of prospects theyre here and continue to grow that unknown analyst i feel like i have one question indiscernible just a question on indiscernible joseph a staples give me one second i actually think i brought it with me here yes so as far as seats to put it in perspective so in  there are about  million cloud contact center seats and there are  million premisebased contact centers so even though the cloud contact center space is growing at a much much faster rate this year it will be about  of the total seats out there donald e brown okay our next presenters gary blough our evp for worldwide sales and paul weber vp for north america sales so gentlemen ready gary r blough joe as a reminder were being webcast what do you think id say is  we can go a little further than this room anyway im gary blough executive vice president of worldwide sales to my right paul weber were going to split this my focus is  well lets start pauls focus is on north america so hes going to bring some color to and specifics to what were doing here in north america how were winning those types of things im going to focus on all of our nonnorth american business so thats why  of us are here so well split this im going to start just with a little overview on what were going to try to accomplish in the next  minutes and were going to talk about the current activity in spending trends spend a little time on what has  what weve seen change in the last year ill talk about how we get invited to deals and to deals that maybe we werent getting invited to some time ago who we compete against and why we win and well talk a little bit about recent wins in both our hosted or our cloudbased business as well as our premises business and i thought i would start off with  this is an excerpt from goals and directions that we publish as an organization at the beginning of each year and those goals this year include we wanted to continue to grow outpace the market our target is we want to grow at a clip of at least  this year we want to achieve a deployment mix where cloud becomes at least  of our new software sales in  we want to be the top vendor in new cloudbased contact center seats in  and then we want to expand into key international geographies ill talk a little bit about those expansions and where they are what were doing as an organization as a sales organization we really divided ourselves into  pieces of sales and sales operations and we believe this is a deployment model a methodology that weve developed that works very well inside of north america it works very well in the areas around the world and we have worldwide coverage but in areas around the world that we operate today and it works exceptionally well when we choose to expand into another region as an example were looking at some regions that we havent focused on in the past in emea we would take this methodology and overlay it onto that country or onto that region and have a model whereby we can deploy we know how we want to staff all of those sorts of things that includes expanding through a combination of either acquisitions or organic growth it includes looking at both indirect and direct sales if you take a look at our indirect versus direct sales inside of north america we are right at  with direct indirect outside of north america in some marketplaces well be as much as  indirect where were counting on partners to help us with local languages local customs whatever they would be to be successful in those markets the direct sales with interactive intelligence we as of course say a combination of partners but then we have different roles within our organization including territory managers for both the contact center and the midmarket segments of the market we have strategic account managers many times referred to as major account managers in other organizations and our partner managers and then we developed what we call our small center sales as well with an inside sales group that are focusing directly on those smaller upto contact center seats a piece of the market we had a fear that we were not accurately addressing as recently as the beginning of this year we created the small center sales group so that we want to make sure that were not ignoring portions of the market that can be profitable and valuable to us and then we developed a sales operations team the sales operations team are more on the technical size side in most cases but they include  sales systems engineers inside sales rfp teams partner teams caas specialists so people who are specializing on those cloudbased opportunities with us and then strategic consulting whereby well go into key opportunities with a team of people who have call center management call center development experience and can go in with a real understanding of how things need to be deployed and how companies can be successful we found that to be a very very strategic part a very very profitable part a good part of our business and our sales operations group where our people are in  weve got  this is the sales in sales operations  in north america  in emea  in the japan asia australia new zealand and apac regions and  in latin america now to show you onto some of the emphasis we have on growing regions outside of north america some of the growth that we saw in  we had a   just under  growth in north america in those  teams sales and sales operations  growth in emea now thats a byproduct of a couple of acquisitions that we did there of partners one in the netherlands and one in south africa so we did put on quite a few headcount  or expanded our headcounts there by a considerable amount and japan australia and new zealand and asia pacific  growth and  growth in latin america so you can see the emphasis that were putting on growing not only the north american business but the nonnorth american business as well well continue that through this year were looking at about a  growth across the board in sales and sales operation headcount contribution to the revenues in  versus  you can see its very close to the same things have not changed too much asia pacific is identically the same north america has gone up but just a little bit but what were doing is  i see this as a testament to or a confidence factor that we are growing our business across the world and not just in one region that gives us a lot of stability of there are economic downturns as were experiencing in some parts of europe right now so we want to make sure that we have a good stable business thats going to grow its a grow and weather impact of what may be an economic downturn or something that happens in a certain part of the world in  youve seen this figure before but our orders  our worldwide orders were up  so were experiencing good growth within the orders growth at interactive intelligence order statistics in   or on  orders over  million  of the   in  for a  increase so a nice increase and satisfying one of our objectives of going upmarket on the size of orders orders over  not including of course the ones over  million we have  versus   growth there new customers we were right on target thats a key tracking factor that we look at all the time we want to make sure that were growing what we call and we refer to as new logos because there is a statistic within interactive intelligence that when we get a new company  of the time they will buy additional software within the first  months of their initial acquisition so its a nice factor for followon growth for the organization average customer order this is  im not sure a statistic i would use too commonly because with our movement into the cloudbased business these are order numbers thats gone up considerably so its gone up to  from  million to  million but then we take a look at the premises growth premises followon premises overall and then the cloud growth of course the real growth is in the cloudbased business and again were focusing on that we certainly dont ignore the premisesbased implementations and opportunities because some companies just want to go in that direction but as a company were looking to have about  of our new software orders in  to be in the cloudbased business and then in q  we had  orders this was just announced a week ago yesterday  orders over  million  orders between  and  million so the trend seems to continue and has continued through and into q of  im going to turn it over to paul real quick and let him talk about some of the things were doing in north america and why we believe were winning here so paul paul weber all right not to contradict my direct boss but mix of direct and indirect in north america nothing really has changed here its still  new  direct  im sorry yes direct  through the partners the difference there is that a lot of the cloud business especially the highend cloud business is at this point coming direct our partners we were just meeting with them theyre doing things to realize the value of their company with recurring revenue versus onetime we have made some changes to how they  we compensate the partners so that they can compensate upfront theyre in a lot of these deals youre seeing them everywhere they just had the most significant change in the market its just that so theyre coming around but its not going to happen right away we do lead with our cloud offering as opposed to going in eitheror we really  we are  our competitive edge with the cloud space is so significant and the fact that if somebody insists on premise we can always fall back to that the best way for us to win and get in first place which we do very quickly is to lead with the cloud we do continue to build strategic partnerships and where a lot of our business is coming from are the likes of salesforce salesforcecom as you all know are in a lot of contact center deals they do not have an offering of their own they have  partners and i think its a good thing so they come in and they say look at these  guys obviously were one of them incontact five some kind of smaller players we have not seen  i was asked yesterday with the media have you seen anything with genesys and their cloud and we really have not we see genesys go in proposing a cloud solution or at least talking cloud and when it comes down to what they propose they more likely will come through with an ibmmanaged service premisetype solution their other  options are still out there one via att and one via verizon im not seeing much of this new thing at all so salesforce brings us in these deals we immediately get in a lead if its a significant deal  agents and above and were doing really well our integration to salesforce and to microsoft lync is an extreme competitive advantage as well so when they talk about having this integration in screentop we really do blow them away if you were in this mornings session i dont know if you all were or not you got a taste of that we take that  weve taken this idea of doing integrations and that we made it probably the most significant development group within our company and it really wins business for us ibm we love them we hate them we compete with them whatever is  the deal drives it right so ibm has brought us into some recent  recently brought us into some very significant deals the individuals out of canada which is our call center influence group i feel our relationship is really jumping up to a new level theyre not interested in implementing or supporting the software or even doing customizationtype work they do like the idea that were doing all of these global implementations of cloudbased contact centers for some of these very bigname companies like philips medical and the idea that they can go in and do more of a real strategic change managementtype consulting is very attractive to them its attractive to us because if we want to go and enable ibm from a services perspective we kind of have been down that path just missing  the goals are just conflicting right everybodys trying to make money on each part they really have become a decent partner and then other times like at kohls i think you all are aware of we competed with genesys partnering with ibm were okay with that microsoft we  or im sorry oracle they have end of life their telephonyatwork platform we believe that we are wellpositioned to potentially become the platform that they demonstrate fusion on when they bring in all their customers for their big visit thats a huge direction for them after buying right now we have a very strong integration with oracle as well and where we gain a lot of the credibility there is a level below the salespeople but more into system or sales engineering and its starting to generate some pretty strong business microsoft lync the only change with microsoft lync and how we work with them is i know you all are aware of our midmarket team that we really are at the communications platform uc or ip pbx replacement now those  that team of ours in north america is leading with caas and when they go into an opportunity that says they have  agents and  business users as opposed to just coming in and saying you have to buy our communications platform as a whole theyre asking are you a link partner or a customer if you are why dont we just do a contact center you can do lync for voice that pbx piece for us is not critical the complex problemsolving is so were kind of letting them take in the shackles off them a bit and let them go with that market and partner with microsoft we do continue to recruit from a partnering perspective a lot of the lync voice partners and anybody cloud or peer cloudrelated is where were focusing our channel partner recruiting efforts as opposed to going out and getting the old traditional telecom guys verticals have not changed a whole lot other than were killing it in this healthcare exchange market its where the states are taking on their own ability to sell insurance or deliver insurance we are really doing well there were doing well there through a couple of  very strategic partners that are bringing us in we continue to do well anything insurancerelated the other change i would say that we had been doing very well in the past few years in utilities and energyrelated we are starting to see some of those companies come in and look at a cloud offering which is kind of new the other new potential vertical is hospitality management at this show we have  different big hospitality chains that are looking to completely revamp customer service and again the same things are driving those guys they do really want to have a video solution they really do want to have this nextgen social they want to have something on the iphone and theyve been running the same old stuff forever in the early days they would buy whoever had that  the hotel package and all that theyd get the call center its kind of old stuff so were starting to see some activity there from a market segmentation perspective or a sales perspective you all know we have been moving upmarket so we have been promoting territory managers into major account spots so somebody is working in indianapolis as a territory manager doing both channel and direct they land a very large customer they become promoted to a major account person we backfill them with a territory manager so we dont lose sight of that midmarket those beautiful  to milliondollar deals and then from there from an expansion perspective we are allowing that major account person to hire strategic account development people to work for them so a lot of that our growth as we look at next year and with the start were off to this year we are planning right now for a big jump in targets right so in order to do that we look at a couple of different ways were obviously a geographic expansion so whether  were adding actual new regions but now that the midmarket group is succeeding in selling a cloudbased solution where their average contract can be  instead of  we are going to be able to expand them as well and then we will continue to add territory managers across the board because now a territory manager truly can do  million to  million by doing a decentsized premise deal and  or  cloud deals so that deal then when we are more of a startup phase we truly did have areas in the country that we are just working from a point of scarcity northern california we  until  years ago we did not do well there but now i mean don and i have been out there  times in the last  months we have bigname technology companies and were taking them down one at a time not all cloud by the way a couple of  im not going to name names so a couple of recent pretty big brandnew superprogressive technology companies they bought premise and again i prefer cloud but we dont care in the end right so that  and talking just a little bit about  i dont know what we pulled out on some of these but let me just finish on that the midmarket so we will expand small center why are we excited about small center we  i believe were going to win a very nice deal in silicon valley its a medical equipment company similar to maybe a philips but the lead came by some guy being a ceo on an airplane pulled out the small center ad walked into a company thats not even very far from here in illinois and said why arent you looking at these guys so that idea of getting our name out and just really being able to do maybe a year from now  or  of these new logo companies what percentage of those are really going to grow into the big market hopefully a lot right so we are excited about coming from the bottom up weve done the upmarket and were also going to have  i wouldnt say flood the market we are going to increase headcount at that midmarket because we do have the business out there you heard joe talk about the percentage of suits that are cloud versus premise thats a huge market for us and if you throw that on top of the genesys base the aspect base and the avaya base its just endoflife where well compete and win a good percentage we think that market is really significant just other canadian from strategic initiatives you may remember that we did do a partnership with rogers telecom up in canada about a year ago and we did set them up with our people to run their own cloudbased offering for rogers customers most of which are the federal government of canada and we did some presentations up there they did a pretty big significant upfront commitment and now they have filled those seats for that commitment and we have a person that works for us that is a business development person who has teamed with an internal rogers person and they are really doing well they really have a captive audience of a contracted federal government space that has  feeds out there running what they told me id said what do you run they said think of the oldest most disjointed stuff youve ever heard of and thats what we have right so we have a great effort that were succeeding in right now and they also have a really significant prospect with them here that rogers brought in  nevermind i keep forgetting were webcasting its a big prospect in as well so were excited about that we are also doing our own data centers mike ph probably talked about that in canada because we still need to have a direct answer for global sites and not in rogers as well channel growth id touched on this the difference in our channel growth is that again we are interested in more of a cloud partner that does more of referrals then wants to get in the space and make a name for themselves we have however recently signed one of avayas largest call center i think avayas largest call center partner in north america and i will name them theyre  its nacr owned by converge one they are a big bigtime player in the call center space and we are very excited about their commitment to our market the did acquire one of our top partners and so they have the expertise so we are excited about that but from a recruiting perspective we really like what we have we have a core group of channel partners in north america and we are going to put resources in this to make them better im not going to fix any more partners were not going to convince anymore partners why they should come on board were really trying to spend our time and energy on the ones that already get it and then as the nacrs come along well go that route as well that one was the one i was going to take off just on some of the large opportunities again we get asked a lot all these big deals are they all caas id say theyre all looking at caas but they dont all go caas right so looking at the  our salesforcecom when you look at a big deal to small yes a lot of the large opportunities are caas but again we have seen these switch back to premise or their own cloud and they just decide to buy it and i dont think weve really seen a necessary trend that is happening less often i think that on the high end there is going to be a mix of companies that are going to look at cloud get that bid but still end up going premise and again i think were obviously fine with that that scalable allinone base solution you knew of some of our like a really big q win that was premisebased that was your traditional win of  they had     different systems they were upgrading and they basically said well we can either upgrade this or we can spend x and go to an allinone platform that will get us to the nextgen customer service that will allow us to incorporate video that will allow us to do mobile app that whole bit and we are seeing a lot more of those types of opportunities as well hybrid versus the traditional cloud there is a lot of concern about cloud out there right people have been burned theyre afraid their marriage is too strong right and we kind of go in and say you know we kind of have a hybrid solution if you want to keep your data on your side you can if you want to manage your voice we dont care but were going to get the system up and running were going to prove it the fives reliability is going to be on us you guys cant sue your it department right you cant fire them this is all we do from a security perspective were way ahead of the competition and typically ahead of what an internal company can do for themselves an internal it group so that idea of a hybrid solution is obviously boding very well security we do believe that when  especially when we get through this summer were going to take security and really make that a competitive advantage as well so we are going to publish our security data on a site just like we do testlab at inin and we are going to use that as a thoughtleadertype competitive advantage as well we have found again that some of these big new customers in northern california in the technology space we would come in and they would have this list of questions for security we would answer them immediately and they would kind of come to us and say hey so how did you find out all that stuff out how do you know so much about that because there really is a new very real fear and concern and we feel that we can take that and make that a competitive advantage as well next genmobility story i dont know  years ago it was a discussion in a board meeting last year it was kind of cool at our kickoff meeting when we were talking about oh what if this next generation our kids didnt want to call your ivr and what if everybody did everything on the iphone and i dont know if any you were in there this morning or if youll be around for the end of it this is extremely real and when youre talking to the vps of customer care especially of big traditional businesses this is what scares them more than anything because theyve spent a gazillion dollars all around the phone and then they finally took a step to email and sometimes with chat and now these smaller competitors that are coming to us are going to come out with a product that on your iphone you basically pop an im at them and they come back over some different options of when you might chat and at that point you might do video or you might not talk at all or when that happens and that goes into that customer service center they know how that call came in what they did what types of steps they know everything about them they may have authenticated it via facebook they know all our information along with that this is what keeps up the big  the vps or customer care of these big companies awake it really does scare them and it should as you all know so that part has really gone from a doing what to do well as a company right which is trying to figure out whats next in the contact center space and get ahead of it don and his team are obviously really great at that that ones been a major home run bay bridge backing up a little i think youve already heard about that acquisition but bay bridge people love it because first of all their main competitor is a spreadsheet so its not an established market it does have a very strong roi and their customer base they have not had the support behind them that they will now that theyre part of i their customer base is extremely impressive and extremely happy and it takes a story of ours on a workforce scheduling and it fills the void for us so that was a great acquisition how am i doing steve on time why were winning and who were competing with in north america not a whole lot of change from probably the last time we presented to you all we see on the cloud we see the little guys incontact five every once in a while some of the carrierbased partners not a whole lot there weve not seen anything significant from the big guys other than a lot of press releases and im sure theyre working on their stories to get something going so our win percentage in the cloud space is still significantly higher than it ever was on the premise side i do believe that people are starting to make decisions on that whole nortel avaya thing they had time for that whole story to kind of sink in of  it really is going this way theyre to going to change their direction i dont think theyll  and the markets been really received as far as a great future direction for avaya contact center so we are seeing some good replacement there aspects the same still very vulnerable small end its  were really shifting to the cloud so its really back to the same cloud players that it questions unknown attendee indiscernible its almost back in ph  indiscernible how does the pipeline look and indiscernible visibility indiscernible paul weber i mean our visibility is we track obviously opportunity buy size and deployment type we track on a weekly basis new opportunities added to the pipeline and that is our biggest indicator you have your number of forecasted of business upside which is businesses not completely locked up and you have a chance of winning it and then you have your old pipeline the difference with having our pipeline managed the way it is now versus the old systems was that salesforcecom did a visibility right to steve or don or gary so people dont tend to put stuff in the pipeline with big numbers to make them feel good or to try to kid their boss because we can go in there and know when they talked when they went there last and asked ph  so visibility wise overall we really have a very strong grasp on what type of opportunities are coming we know in what verticals we win very well we know that in the cloud probably were going to win at even a higher percentage so as to why were comfortable with  im a sales guy my quote is higher than  but we feel that the business momentum our reputation in the market now what percentage is that ph  gary r blough internationally yes as an organization what paul covered off as far as our visibility into the pipeline we use salesforcecom and weve got very good visibility and we use that religiously now to make sure that were on top of it including reports of where things have moved in and out of forecast range pipeline and some categories that we use so our visibility is really good overall as we look out a couple of months into third quarter and into fourth quarter the pipelines are certainly there to substantiate at least that  growth so we feel confident that were on another good run for it a good solid year in  unknown attendee indiscernible gary r blough good you know what i  im sorry all right the question was is that we were  we just have converted a premises space that interactive intelligence indiscernible customer to a cloud base interactive intelligence customer and it was a very nice sale for us that sales in north america so im going to let paul respond to what he sees as a trend and if theres anything left out from international perspective i will also come in paul weber yes we do have  we did a session today i believe on premisebased customers interested in looking at going to the cloud i have no idea on percentages i do know that the call center thinking about from a contact center perspective if you were a cio and a ceo and saying you need to do some of the cloud ive been reading about it it really looks great contact centers a natural for it right again we get to leave the data onsite we handle the slas we handle security right they have their own data security but we are guaranteeing that it departments are swamped and now you take that and you throw on the idea that you go to this it group and say hey by the way thanks for putting in that premisebased system but we really want to do this mobility play and we want to do it now thats tough to react right so its not so much that they dont want to deal with it its  it is looking at and going ph man if theyre going do something cloud based contact center makes sense so we do think theres an opportunity there we are going to do some specialists from an internal perspective to work on those deals next year because one thing i cant have or we cant have is a new logo business dropping because were swapping from premise to caas so were going to train basically an inside group that will go out and when that customer calls and says hey i have that interest theyre going to go and theyre going to have the roi information theyre going to know all the pricing and all that and were going to attack it that way unknown attendee indiscernible paul weber on the new logo  the question was why was the new logo account relatively flat last year i would say that last year we did see a significant increase in the size of the individual opportunities we were not staffed at the beginning of last year to handle that and a significant new logo growth so its just a natural thing when somebodys working on  million deals with  years ago they might have been working on  million and  or   deals they are going to work on those deals so thats where the staff increase is going to happen and then the other question was if we had pure cloud unknown attendee indiscernible paul weber yes i mean if it were everything that its going to be when it gets out the cost  one of the things about pure cloud is that idea of that storage thats a big significant cost if we can lower that price point in the market which we should be able to do yes i think well be able to sell heck of a lot more we cant wait to have that gary r blough just real quick on the  from the international perspective on the new logo growth i think what we saw was a little bit of a swing of the pendulum on the acquisitions that we made the assimilation of those companies into interactive intelligence we didnt see the new logos coming out of a couple of areas south africa germany netherlands that we thought we would that we had seen in the past so were seeing that pendulum swing back to where wed like it to be so i believe well see that in a more positive light in  yes unknown attendee indiscernible paul weber yes so the question was that i had mentioned that when the  in the partner community we have  for our select partners that qualify we will pay a percentage of the fees upfront which will enable them to pay their salespeople and absorbed sales costs upfront we started that maybe  months ago or so and we are  that was just with our key partners yes the pipeline is growing there unknown attendee in terms of repeat orders with some of your customers can you just  what does an average customer look like and some of the larger deals youre winning sallie mae or kohls is this one deal and done or do you anticipate there is business ph indiscernible  paul weber so the questions is on a larger ideal what is the potential for addon business almost  it is almost always youre accomplishing some immediate task with a big back end now the certainty of these deals you mentioned some of them did buy a lot of it upfront theres still going to always be addon software theyre certain of those solutions and a lot of times with the cloud where we go in and we win one contact center and theyve selected us as a standard but they still have to justify it and sell it internally in a lot of these different places and thats where these guys that work for the major account person thats how theyre compensated is to go out into those other departments and say hey we proved it in this pilot we have a contract you guys should get on board unknown attendee indiscernible one more question indiscernible  order growth how is that coming from customer initiative ph indiscernible paul weber this year i mean well  our new logo north america numbers in q were up i believe so across the board we have  we are starting to see a higher volume our midmarket group did  new logos in q they probably did  q of last year so i hope itll keep it somewhat even but these big deals are going to swing that a little bit my  i will tell you one of my biggest initiatives again talking about that caas to premise  i mean premise to caas weve had a time  years ago when we made our number but those new logos werent hitting were not going to let that happen again now we are  our compensation everything is driven towards new logos stephen r head thanks gary and paul and give us just a couple of minutes we have a few folks here for a customer panel so well get situated okay were continuing with the presentations we had  people scheduled but  are here we have jeff elder from nelnet jeff miller from regus and jim stover from emerson climate technologies and what id like to do in this session is have each of them just spend a few minutes talking about themselves first and then really most of this leave it open for questions that you have so i gave them this kind of outline before just im putting it up here as a reminder kind of talk a little bit about themselves their role what theyve been doing with interactive for premise or caas and some other comments relative to interactive just to get it started so well let jeff first you up start and take it from there jeffrey miller my name is jeff miller im with regus im the director of global sales business global ph reporting to the sales organization so we purchased i back in  for that first country in september  we currently to date have  countries live all throughout the americas emea and asia pac we are a onpremise but pretty much built in the private cloud so we dont really have onpremise what its been ph that kind of reach our ph contact centers throughout but it would of ph our own private cloud and as far as volume goes today we have a little over  inside salespeople on the system future growth plans we have  more countries in the process of going live brazil and japan and then we have  more countries lined up behind them on future growth were looking at bringing on our field sales organization which would put us probably in the neighborhood of around  salespeople inside deal ph operating cant count how countries yet we operate in  countries were not exactly sure how many of those countries we will not be able to support very likely therell be some countries its structure wise is just not feasible but the top   countries we expect well have our employees live on the interactive platform stephen r head jim jim stover my name is jim stover and im actually just  im the technical guy for emerson climate technologies were located in sidney ohio im responsible for not only the interactive business also our phone and voicemail indiscernible  so we have recently  well i guess i should say recently emerson corporate decided that interactive would be the corporate standard for the enterprisesized contact center applications deal ph  and we currently have and are certain to migrate from a cisco contact center express and we are approaching that limit for our agents to assess if theyre capable of handling indiscernible  so far we only have probably about  or   converted and were  basically a test pilot that we did was a distribution services organization we found at milford ph indiana theyve been very happy with it and i will be very happy if i can do some changes to it but the goal is to migrate from the system to indiscernible because those servers go into support so certainly after this conference when i get back itll hopefully get indiscernible straightened out and then satisfied we will start that migration process and we have approximately about  to  people depending on whether we keep it rolling or not emerson climate exploited in the contact center indiscernible  weve only been involved in this probably just about  years and were not nearly fairly mature i guess i should say were not indiscernible for instance as mature at this time but as we grow im sure that well confident indiscernible want us to do so were quite happy with the interactive solution that provides the expertise for doing that indiscernible  other than that theres been a lot of training for indiscernible we have indiscernible training department to do it but with cisco help ph was good technically sometimes its hard to get weve been very happy with what weve been seeing from interactive and we look forward to growing this indiscernible  jeff elder good afternoon im jeff elder im an it director at nelnet i saw sallie mae up there in the slide earlier theyre our competition for anyone that knows our business and by the way we had our system  years before they did so theyre trying to catch up so our systems a premise system today it sits at our data center we have  agents that use our system we have most of lines of business within nelnet we have  its kind of kc ph the servicing we have the drive net ph servicing and then we have a leadgeneration type business called india ph  and we also have a book company called petersons company my background comes from ibm att days i worked  started as a technical person and had worked up through team lead and management senior management into account management during that time we primarily focused on the cisco via the occasional nortel didnt see much genesys we  i started nelnet  years ago and when we  when i started there we just won that financial book of business so now theres us selling greatly since the deal the government student loan servicing right so indiscernible profit keeping our profit now volumes dictated by  metrics right you got  surveys and  default metrics so youre  what you try to do is try to get to the  position so you get the most volume by the way were  sallie mae is  just for the record and so we  i came in within  months i had to select the sound system that could scale that could grow that could see the features we need for our demographics right our demographics a wide generation and more selfservice more social media and we didnt have that we didnt have the scale we had an old avaya system key systems we have bolton aspect we have witnessed blue pumpkin and you can imagine a support team who were supporting that infrastructure was quite large it was about  people we grew through acquisition so one of the companies we bought about  years ago or more was firstmark in minneapolis minnesota its a private standalone servicing and there was one guy jody nelson who supported a older i system out there by himself not only did he support that system he supported everyone at the top ph  he was kind of the it guy he was like okay you just plug the system in and play and let it run now he actually programmed the ivr he did all the coring he did all the stuff like hes all in one system so when we did the analysis and looked at the different phone systems in my background i listed avaya and cisco i wasnt even in the picture until ive talked to this guy im like okay so you tell me one guy can support this system and granted this call center was about  to  agents it got my attention so we started an analysis and we really liked selling price points i call him the rf ph possible so every time weve talked to the i teams the solution teams the technical people behind the scenes they would tell me how they could work around that solution or obstacle give me ideas in  to improve performance whereas the avayas and ciscos they give me its going to cost you more lets go hack and update that didnt work right i didnt like that i need to be quick and nimble i have  months to get this system up and i had a volume coming in december so we signed the deal into august beginning september i had the system up for a major call center with live  or  ph that was huge that was huge so that to me was a big obstacle i need to get over and i stuff doesnt deliver so weve grown with i they get paid by the drink ph right so as weve grown we started off back in  with  agents and now we have  so we really enjoy the system and we look forward to where its going with the strategic roadmap don played out and kind of given us another ph features to our demographics any questions unknown attendee maybe for like ph jim indiscernible your experience of indiscernible real estate ph indiscernible  jim stover yes what we had before or what we still have actually is a cisco unified contact center express which by nature that can handle up to  agents and were fast approaching that number when we started looking at the possibility to a fullblown cisco contact center enterprise and the support weve taken to a loan ph the licensing and the hardware theyre providing ph could be a good fit indiscernible  we sat down and looked at it they talked us ph we went over theyd never heard of  honestly they never heard of interactive we came over to indiana in february ph we were ph couple of hours away indiscernible sat down for a demonstration they walked out and they said wow so i mean that kind of was our first impression because they can do  already do all those things that we would like to do down the road so its not going to  were out having a big ph learning curve on how to do this we have somebody to rely on who can give us a ph and that was  and now its on the ph more so like were in infancy ph and ive got  to  ph or  person because they have a contractor that helps myself our network monitoring individual and our network management team so its a good thing that this is just fairly good news ph for me anyway because i dont have a lot of time to spend on it so i made the comment about my company were great at being trying to say ph what they really want and indiscernible not selling this say okay just as if ph listen to what we really think theyre doing were going to make some changes and indiscernible because i saw that ph the contact center our main contact center is in linoma ph it supports at least  other businesses that we have well control ers pct ph ers fc ph side thats emerson retail solutions out of kennesaw georgia indiscernible atlanta they are the main focus of our contact center so in indiscernible refrigeration setting up ph in grocery stores some indiscernible pharmacies its just a very  one of the service areas that we kind of grow into so the sooner we can get everything settled for the people that we have on the interactive solutions indiscernible  there have been at least  demos done for the ers and were excited about getting on the system its now getting to a point where we can sit down ph indiscernible  their biggest challenge right now is the company and the clients but weve already told them that we can support one of their groups the smallest i think is services group and were looking forward to getting done with this issue ph indiscernible  unknown attendee indiscernible jeffrey miller so we have  weve been ph inbound outbound auto dialer email chat and workforce management unknown attendee indiscernible jeffrey miller thats correct about  of our volume comes through electronic web inquiries and had been  the rest indiscernible is inbound system ph calls were definitely dialer heavy a lot of competition so with our business a large portion of our business comes from broker channels in the commercial real estate and so its not uncommon for us to receive a web inquiry along with  of our competitors at the same time so with the interactive intelligence dialer solution were able to on average make contact on those new leads in under  minutes which allows us to be the first person to see the customer which helps because the second guy if he calls  minutes later gets voicemail so this is definitely giving us indiscernible  now we also use the managed services for us and we didnt have a large indiscernible to be able to support the new system i think weve  that managed services allow us to go live and its all we use today stephen r head any other questions unknown analyst indiscernible unknown attendee whats nice about our relationship with interactive intelligence is we compete for ideas so weve  virtual hold is one idea that came out of our shop the iphone app as it links back to the indiscernible and just came out of our shop as compared to others that came out of that as well so they  the features that you see are usually coming  were listening to the customers and thats what youre seeing we were asking for it the names there the ipad app is something ive seen  years ago that one is coming out and thats key for us right because your supervisors your leaders on the floor need to be out there interacting with their agents and if you have a big core like ours  agents i think youre more effective if youre mobile so yes i would say were feeding that theyre listening and thats what were seeing unknown attendee the ipad app definitely were interested a lot of our countries are small teams so i might have  people in italy  in france and the ipad app would be really helpful for the country manager at a glance be able to see whats going on within sitel ph there any actions need to be taken and so thats an area that were very excited about we give that visibility to their senior executive team to eventually do run their inside sales team unknown analyst indiscernible unknown attendee we use the all online products right and thats  theres different reasons for that we like it we got their support there the reporting is all there so weve used that now are there different features that competition has sure but does that again that feedback is getting back to i and theyre changing the product there was another piece i left out and this is security compliance being a federal contractor another cloud came another security came at in kohls presentation security is key for us so thats why we have premise solution i think if they start developing more security around that hosted model specifically around being governmentcompliant in the data center with the data et cetera youll see a bigger niche going that direction unknown analyst i have a list of names indiscernible unknown attendee so i did our implementations and they delivered nearly everything we asked for if i were to go back and look at the learnings i probably should have given me everything i asked for and we tried to utilize the race car when i was replacing pbxs and so what weve done over the past year is really gone from taking that exotic race car and have come back to a more general chevy and we now focus on not trying to do everything completely automated and as fast as possible and try to put something more on their shift within our agents and so with highly complex and difficult  the difficult part was finding people smart enough to figure out why this beast didnt work and we had challenges with integration a lot of that was because we  our geographical spread london is our primary data center cic is in america just passing data between the  and the challenges theyre going to have with that so theres been some lessons learned the integrations were a challenge for us we accept it understand that we have a much simpler system today that had we probably started out simpler it wouldve been indiscernible but in their defense we didnt want simple we asked for a really complex and fast result with the it works we just found that it actually wont matter anyway unknown attendee i guess for us it was indiscernible disappointed with speed so what was sacrificed if you take that indiscernible so going back to that missed time we have to show how we built our system how secure it is its encrypted interaction encrypted the rest but all that documentation around that is up to them unknown attendee from a business standpoint implementation its different with what we had expected what were immature in their contact center are  was not sophisticated by any means as long as the agent who ph represented the call and he was able to handle the call and take care of the customer indiscernible requirement indiscernible and im sure that down the road we will be adding more thats just the nature of things as we progress im sure that our monthly cost will go up and interactive also but its been a good relationship that im happy to work indiscernible unknown attendee thats on my list so i should admit one of the presentations i wanted to on that  on bay bridge because i was speaking and ive already arranged a private time to go through it and learn more about it and one of the challenges that we have in our business is that you  because were in so many new countries we dont necessarily have a large management team to really manage things as tight as we like and so we can leverage some of that technology that helps us as a country manager who spend a few hours managing the contact center if some of that technology can help them be more efficient then thats definitely something that were looking at unknown attendee good question its definitely indiscernible  we have met a storm today weve been building capital investment were kind of waiting for that depreciation to run off before we kind of start that process again definitely theres potential to leverage i there in a related topic were moving to a natural language ivr because thats in the demographics so were working with i and nuance on integration of that natural language ivr so i think were one of the first people to do that and weve got some great work grid ph in terms of integrating that product with factory systems unknown attendee i guess my ultimate dream of being with interactive is becoming so large that they can reduce the individual costs of a customer in all honesty i expect it to increase but i think that the value will be there i think they will be offering more for maybe with the same base price that we now have they may have a better offering so well have   years from now  im their technical guy were starting to  im just now starting to hear questions about what can we do with all of these information were gathering so bay bridge is probably something that obviously guessing that our directors take a look at and thats one of their superiors but in all honesty  years from now im going to be retired its somebody elses issue stephen r head well thank you gentleman indiscernible okay now were to the final part of the presentation which is mine and this will be fairly short i think everybody here has seen these slides at one point or another so ill just go through them quickly and then open it up for questions you know the financial highlights from the first quarter it was a good strong quarter up nicely over a year ago we have a nice  couple of nice things contributing to that but just the overall level of the business activity continues to be very strong balance sheet continues to be very solid orders by region for the last couple of years jerry touched on this earlier this breaks it down and actually shows cloud versus premises in the different regions but overall strong growth around the world in the last couple of years and other than the fact that weve got cloud now as part of the mix the breakdown hasnt changed much in the last  or  years weve had a lot of good growth all around the world over that period of time revenue performance continue to have a lot of products revenues and a lot of that is still driven by current customers that as weve heard from the last panel and as youve heard today in some of the new applications that were deploying this is a chance to generate more revenue from current customers our cloud business continues to grow that brighter red keys in the middle and it was up nicely last year maintenance continues to grow because of the growth of the cloud business  or excuse me because of the growth of the product revenues which resulted in more maintenance revenues in the following year and then professional services have really taken off strongly in the last couple of years and i really get to the fact that weve done more direct business especially in the cloud area and so were delivering more of the professional services ourselves operating income we made a decision that we announced the beginning of last year that were really going to invest heavily on this cloud initiative and the investment hits us in  different ways one is we ramped up the spending on rd and sales and marketing at the same time because more of our orders were cloud and not being recognized currently we werent getting the revenue immediately but we have the costs but we did that we still remained profitable and were still generating good cash from the business cash balances continue to be pretty steady our main use of cash since we are generating positive cash from the business has been acquisitions we talked about that a couple of different times today with some of the acquisitions weve made in different regions of the world to really have a greater direct presence in those various markets and some of those acquisitions acrosoft going back to  latitude  bay bridge which you have mentioned a couple of times here was just last year and then distribution with a guy ph called time audio brightware and most recently the interactive business that amtel managed in new zealand and we talked about the projections for this year its really driven around  main items one is the  order growth and the fact that were expecting about half of those orders to be cloud up from  that were cloud last year and as we updated the revenue guidance coming off of the first quarter expecting about  million to  million in revenue our cloudbased revenues increasing to about  up about  so they will be about at the midpoint about  of our overall revenue recurring revenues are all being about  of the total operating margin relatively unchanged from last year we said  to  operating margin on a nongaap basis as hopefully youve gained from today were having a lot of success with cloud that just means were generating a lot of backlog of business without the revenues hitting the income statement currently but we still have a lot of those expenses but we think its a good thing for the business in the long run and we do expect margins to improve both as we scale the cloud operations and as we see purecloud being delivered next year those will both i think give us a chance to start improving the margins on the cloud business and overall seeing our margins starting to turn back upwards so thats the presentations that we have for today im open for any additional questions that you have stephen r head shawn unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head the question is our longerterm outlook what is cloud growth going to be what is the mix of orders going to be over the next few years theres a lot of things that make it difficult  or  years ago i was able to model what the company look like being mostly product driven and the metrics were pretty easy to understand and project its a lot more difficult when we have a big variable called cloud and that percentage of  or  or  is going to make a big difference in the amount of revenue we recognize in the current year so its a lot harder to project out the one thing that i believe is that as the cloud percentage continues to increase its going to continue to pressure our margins  margin expansion because we continue to have a larger portion of our orders were not recognizing currently but we still have the sales and marketing expenses and the development expenses cloud revenues i do expect to continue to climb at a very rapid pace were expecting them to be up about  this year without knowing how this year ends im still expecting a very strong growth rate for next year and the year after but as far as the cloud revenue  cloud orders will grow rapidly i think there is every indication that that is not going to slow down product orders while we said this year were expecting to be relatively flat we had a very good first quarter and theres a lot of good product business thats in the pipeline so for me the surprise might be that the product revenues end up being stronger than were thinking right now but its going to be  get back to being a mix issue for the year as  were already increasing heavily increasing amount of recurring revenue as we sign these cloud orders and it makes really looking forward a little more challenging for the next year or  until we see how some of this different pieces sort out and where they start stabilizing unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head the question is if overall order growth over the next several years is  and product orders are flat that  cloud that implies that cloud is growing at  and i think based on what weve seen in the last few years we feel that we can grow cloud orders at that rate or better we did it the last few years although its easy off of a small base but just the business opportunity we see out there weve been growing much faster than the market rate for a lot of years now and if the overall cloud growth rate in the market is  we would expect to be beating that that has been our history and thats what we think we can continue to do unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head joe in his presentation mentioned a global  mentioned a steep count of  million and im pretty sure that thats a global number because otherwise we would have what  of americans in call centers and i dont think were quite there so  yes philip unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head the question is is the ramp up of caas gross margins and overall with purecloud being introduced where do we think we can take the margins on the cloud business has that captured  right now were in the  margins and that  weve stated that and its really a volume game for us were  revenue last year was low s this year being the s ive always said that well need to be  million or better of cloud revenue to start having margins that are   or better and i still believe that at the ramp were going thats still going to be  or  years down the road but i think we can get there i think when purecloud is delivered that will help us get there even more so than what our current operation im comfortable its going to happen its just going to be taking a period of time for us to achieve both revenue levels yes unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head question is on acquisitions weve done a mix of distribution and complementary technologies and where do we expect it to be going forward i would expect more additional product complementary technologies in distribution the amtel acquisition was one that was more opportunistic they were looking to divest themselves of a relatively small business its close enough to what we were doing in australia that it just made sense to go ahead and acquire that business we werent acquiring all of amtel we just acquired that part of the business related to our operation which is the same thing that happened with atio in south africa last year but really i think what were seeing as real opportunity is where we can expand the product either with complementary type of technologies like bay bridge and theres some other things that were looking at that i think will have more of an emphasis on complementary technologies rather than distribution thanks unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head the question is how comfortable are we with operating margin expansion the operating margin expansion is  i mentioned  of the factors related to it one is just order growth and the percent of cloud the other one that we have that we control is just how the staffing ramps up and weve made decisions as weve talked about in the last couple of years to really ramp up staffing our employee counts have gone up dramatically some of it through acquisitions but mostly through just organic growth i think were going to have to keep monitoring it every year and deciding what is the most prudent thing for the longterm value of the company is it to expand margins or is it to capture market share and capturing market share is really a function of getting the sales and marketing focus that we need which is an expense so im not here to say how much were going to grow next year how much margins might expand next year i think were going to have to assess that when we get through this year and see how the year has played and see what the opportunity looks like yes chris unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head the question was when were signing a contract for data center space how much are we buying upfront and for how long a period of time the data center space cost is really one of the smaller parts of our cost we do sign contracts for a period of time because just as our customers sign a contract that have better pricing for an extended period the data centers work the same so theyre trying to tie a customer up but the biggest expense we have is the hardware were putting in there that were buying now on the hardware side were buying what  a certain amount that we need to get the first customer running but would also probably run the th customer at the same time or a significant portion of it will so were making a fairly significant capital investment just to get established in a country and then we have a period of time where we ramp up to really utilize that investment unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head the question is with your purecloud on the roadmap does that affect the capital spending expectations over the next few years it really doesnt change anything for this year as mike mentioned in his presentation we are planning data centers in canada this year and those are going to be based on their current technology caas offering after this year we will have built up data centers in the markets we have currently identified we will have expansion capabilities in those facilities and also as we talked about we expect to see a combination of the current cic offering the caas offering and the new purecloud offering as we go forward theyre going to really address different customer sets so we dont see caas going away thats a question that again were going to have to kind of monitor and see how it plays out this year i dont see any difference in expenses from what weve anticipated as we see that weve got these data centers built out hopefully well see some ramp down now there is one other side of that is that we have some private cloud customers and in those cases were building out a private cloud for them so there can be some fairly significant capital expenditures upfront but we have a commitment on revenue over a period of time to pay for those yes philip unknown analyst indiscernible stephen r head the question was so what is the ramp on purecloud development today and will that increase as we get closer to having it closer to launch and would rd exceed  for this year well spend about  million on purecloud so if you think about it in the scheme of everything its  or less of our revenue so its a small part of our overall development effort and the important thing to remember too is as don discussed a lot of our development effort that will be ported to purecloud that works for the current cic platform so theres a lot of things that we do that will be reused the purecloud is a platform where well maybe one way i could describe it plug in a lot of the technology we have today so a lot of our development efforts today will work for both platforms over the long term now there is going to be porting i would expect that that purecloud group will be greater next year if we spend  million this year well spend something more than that next year but i dont think it will be in the order of magnitude increase but there will be some increase any other questions so i thank everybody for attending
