geekwire summit earlybird tickets here josh neblett with etailz cofounders sarah wollnick and tom simpson photos via etailzjosh neblett cofounder and ceo of technology and retail company etailz has grown what started as a college business plan into a  million company in his senior year at gonzaga university neblett stepped off his path towards becoming a financial adviser to jump into the world of entrepreneurship and ecommerce having grown up in seattle neblett put down roots in spokane wash in  where he and his wife sarah wollnick cofounded etailz with noted angel investor tom simpson who was neblett’s entrepreneurship professor at gonzaga university josh neblett “we decided the best place to grow and build the company was going to be spokane it has such a quality of life over here where you don’t have the traffic and the rain” said neblett now  years old “seattle has a ton to offer but there is just a different dynamic over here that is really unique” the original brand greencupboardscom became etailz in march of  following the acquisition of ecomomcom etailz now operates five niche websites and three storefronts including greencupboardscom which maintains the ecofriendly focus it was founded upon with  employees etailz continues to grow sales have jumped from  in  to a projected  million in  according to the company neblett says that leveraging the company’s partnership with amazon has been fundamental to that growth neblett views a large portion of his role as ceo as a “moderator of mood” a feat he has tackled with an open office environment and weekly officewide boating excursions on lake coeur d’alene neblett received his bachelors in business administration in  and his mba in entrepreneurship in  from gonzaga he has been awarded spokane’s  under  catalyst’s emerging innovator of the year and was a finalist for ernst  young’s entrepreneur of the year continue reading below for excerpts from our interview tell me about yourself “i grew up over on the west side in seattle and came over to school at gonzaga i was lined up to be a financial advisor and take over my dad’s business and then in my senior year of college i took a class called ‘creating new ventures’ which was my first formal introduction to entrepreneurship that is how the original company started i decided i’d try this whole entrepreneurial thing out i think i have the few loose screws in the head necessary to pursue such a venture” neblett driving a boat on an outing with employees what do you like to do for fun “we have a boat and always go out to lake coeur d’alene and take the employees out on the boat so that’s something we like to do for fun a lot i like to play basketball i love sports i love all things competitive back in the day i used to play poker there are some weird dynamics and interesting similarities between entrepreneurship and poker players and their thought processes i don’t have the time to play so much anymore” how did etailz begin “i remember going home on winter break and saying to my parents ‘i know i have this really lucrative opportunity to take over dad’s business and be a financial advisor and that’s what i have gone to school for but i’ve got a better idea what if i go and start a company in this industry i really know nothing about i’ll make next to nothing and we will see what happens’ and they kind of looked at me funny but supported me through it the day after break ended i showed up on the adjunct professors’ doorstep because he was a venture capitalist and said ‘hey what do you think if we get this thing started we won a business plan competition we have some momentum let’s actually give it a shot’ that first year we made  in sales and our most popular product was a toilet bowl cleaner over time we just learned adapted and moved quickly and eventually got to where we are today”  that first year we made  in sales and our most popular product was a toilet bowl cleaner over time we just learned adapted and moved quickly and eventually got to where we are today how would you explain your business to someone who doesn’t know what it is “at the end of the day we are pretty complex in our approach but the overall business is very simple we are a retailer we essentially find and curate really cool products and sell them online but the way we do it with the level of technology data software and all the complexities is what makes us unique we are one of amazon’s biggest merchants and biggest partners and so that allows us to focus on the supplier curating products building software and building technology and less on customer acquisition as you would as a standard retailer” what has been the biggest learning experience so far “how my role has changed and adapted early on … it was just me in the back of a hallway with sarah sitting around doing customer service studying up relationships doing accounting really the jackofalltrades to some degree and with time as you grow now that we are  employees you have to get better at delegating i heard someone once say that a ceo’s job is a moderator of the mood and architect of the future and i’ve really embraced that for me it’s been a real transition because early on you are always taught if you want something done right do it yourself my job now is to make sure that the culture is right that people understand what we are trying to build here make sure that the mood is in line with something that is going to allow us to grow and then come up with the ideas and implement the ideas that will allow us to continue to grow” what are you looking toward for the future of the company “every year we do something different we move quickly learn and adapt that is our mindset when it comes to innovation and growing the business in terms of the future our goal and our initiative has always been to become the next wave of commerce you don’t hear a lot about marketplace focused merchants but we believe you can build a compelling model to be the worlds’ biggest merchant on what will be the worlds’ biggest marketplace that has been our focus over the last few years and we are excited about the potential of that”

audacious december” says neblett the company made inc ’s fastest growing businesses list in  and  originally named greencupboard the company circled the drain the first year raising  in startup capital but recording just  in revenue mostly on toilet cleaner sales his college professor tom simpson an angel investor had thrown his hat in the ring and became a cofounder “we knew we had to fix it and we knew we had to fix it fast” says neblett  they realized that their most important customers were not the consumers who bought the products but the suppliers who provided them etailz resolved to be the company that solved supplier problems today etailz has  fulltime employees and two storefront locations and represents  suppliers on amazon ebay and its own websites its wide product range includes home electronics baby and pet its alliance with top ecommerce sites eliminates shipping hassles to date it has taken only about  million in outside funding “the company that wins this market

“becoming the industry leader has a lot of appeal to me” says neblett “we’ve just scratched the tip of the iceberg” although neblett and wollnick are seattle natives they prefer the dry climate and reduced traffic in spokane they are also bolstered by community support “in seattle we would have been just another startup technology and retail company in spokane we’re a poster child for success”

amazonetailz has about  employees in its corporate offices and about  more in its distribution warehouse in spokane valley the  million sale of spokanebased etailz inc announced last week was in the works for months but the owners had to keep it quiet and that proved challenging for ceo and cofounder josh neblett “i tend to be overly transparent with the employees really they know everything that’s going on” neblett said at the etailz headquarters in the university district “they didn’t know this was going on and they couldn’t with a publicly held company and all that” on monday after the close of the stock market the some employees of the ecommerce and marketing company gathered to hear about the acquisition by trans world entertainment corp a new yorkbased retailer specializing in video music pop culture and electronics products trans world’s stock trades on the nasdaq exchange revealing the big news was liberating from the “deal fatigue” that built up over the past nine months neblett said “being able to let everyone know so that they could share in the excitement that was a sense a relief from that anxiety” he said it was important to assure the team “that we were still going to operate as etailz we were still going to accomplish the goals that we set forth” he said “we just now have the opportunity to accelerate that growth and to tap into resources we never had previously” etailz will stay put including the company headquarters in the mckinstry innovation center along the spokane river a warehouse in the spokane business and industrial park and the wollnick’s retail store downtown “the plan is to stay in spokane grow out our infrastructure grow out our team there’s a wealth of talent here” neblett said “the quality of life and cost of living and all the things that spokane has to offer are really tough to replace” he continued “so there’s no reason for them to want to move us for this deal i think as much as anything this was about talent acquisition for them we have a very talented team and they know that”technology increasingly important in retailthe business has grown rapidly in the eight years since neblett launched it with sarah wollnick now his wife and gonzaga university adjunct professor tom simpson their angel investor as gonzaga students neblett and wollnick won the school’s hogan entrepreneurial business plan competition in  with their pitch for what then was called green cupboards an online seller of ecofriendly products “one of the things that has made us get to this point is our ability to pivot along the way the only thing that’s consistent from our original business plan is we sell product online” neblett said likewise trans world has had to pivot he said as consumers have migrated to digital downloads and streaming music and movies “the leaders in tomorrow’s retail will be those with the best technology solutions” he said “we’re still at the very infancy of what this all can become and that’s what gets us excited i think that’s what spokane also should be excited about” dan stewart a gonzaga university professor of entrepreneurship and director of the school’s hogan entrepreneurial leadership program applauds the company for the impact it has had on the area’s economic development “we’re super excited they made that conscious decision to stay in spokane” stewart said “we have a retention problem with some of our graduates that they don’t feel like there’s career opportunities as much as we would like to keep our graduates here they go where they perceive the jobs to be”they’re good at bricks etailz is good at clickstrans world has over  fye entertainment media stores and suncoast movie and film memorabilia stores etailz operates five niche websites and specializes in helping brands sell online it sells around  products including through amazon “they’re really good at brick and mortar we’re really good at ecommerce and marketplace” neblett said “we think there’s an opportunity to combine those two specialties into something that’s bigger” but etailz will continue to operate autonomously and grow its brand neblett said “they’re going to continue to grow the fye brand and we’re going to tap into each others’ resources to grow” he said etailz has about  employees crammed into its corporate offices and about  more in its distribution warehouse in spokane valley “we still need all our support people we still need our process we still need everything to help us grow so everything stays in place” neblett said etailz sells worldwide and keeps inventory in canada germany and the united kingdom as well neblett who just turned  will remain in his role and report directly to trans world ceo mike feurer wollnick will continue to oversee the etailz partner relations team which works with over  suppliers simpson their entrepreneurship professor at gonzaga has served as chairman of the board and now will serve as a consultant to trans world feurer is a former executive at coldwater creek the sandpointbased women’s clothing retailer that went out of business in  he and neblett met at a consumer technology trade show and feurer reached out to neblett last year to say he kept hearing about etailz and wanted to learn more “so he actually came spokane and we sat down and talked for a while that was almost nine months ago” neblett said “from there on it was starting to create a vision around what could be as we continued down that path it got more and more exciting and the potential seemed more and more apparent that it made a lot of sense for both sides” neblett said he wanted to be sure the partnership would benefit the longterm success of etailz “i’ve always said we’re not building this company to sell we’re building this company to be an industry leader to be sustainable to be here  years from now” he said he wasn’t shopping around for a buyer but said he always has explored partnerships in building the business “this was no different” he said “the acquisition was all that could make sense because this was a dynamic of retail to retail and if you’re in a retailtoretail relationship you need to likely be a wholly owned subsidiary you can’t partner in any other way in my opinion” breaking the news to employees this week no doubt filled many of them with apprehension neblett acknowledged “a lot of these people have gone through acquisitions before which haven’t gone how this one is going to go” he said “i think everyone feels good about it”outgrowing space in mckinstry buildingneblett said he and wollnick who live in otis orchards have no other immediate plans in light of the sale which included cash stock shares and future earnings based on company performance “from a business standpoint i’m locked in we’re barely scraping the tip of the iceberg” he said “we think we can do a lot more so no i’m not thinking about opening up a restaurant or starting some new technology company will i in the future maybe my focus is fully on executing on the vision here” as etailz continues to grow it likely will need a larger space than what it occupies in the mckinstry building where  months remain on the company’s lease the prime location has worked well neblett said but “we’re exploring everywhere from downtown to liberty lake for opportunities for us to expand into” the company’s move into the mckinstry building in  when its workforce was at  dovetailed with “an intellectual hotbed of entrepreneurship” there said gonzaga’s stewart “i think they’ve just become the core of a new entrepreneurial energy in this area” he said “we make a point to walk our students over there so they can see the space and just absorb some of that culture” stewart said “they love to go over there and hear the story and see the environment it’s my way of telling them there’s hope for you to have a career here” click here to comment on this story » most read stories no criminal charges against

wwwetailzcom   six years ago josh neblett was finishing work on a finance degree at gonzaga university when he experienced a classic “light bulb moment” in his case the light bulb was energy efficient after winning a business competition among area colleges neblett and his future wife sarah wollnick together with venture capitalist tom simpson launched greencupboards an online retailer of ecofriendly products since then the company has rebranded itself etailz to reflect its rapidly expanding line of merchandise and added ecomomcom everycasacom and wollnick’s a retail store at  s perry st last year etailz was no  on inc magazine’s list of fastestgrowing private us companies with  million in sales neblett hopes to double etailz’s revenue this year the ceo discussed his company’s evolution and goals during a recent interview at etailz’s corporate headquarters in the mckinstry innovation center just south of gu’s campus sr where did you grow up neblett south of seattle in yelm pop  sr what were your interests neblett i enjoyed sports and the idea of selling things in high school i started a little ebay business devoted to sports cards and memorabilia i’d collected sr what career did you envision for yourself neblett financial advising i intended to take over my dad’s brokerage business sr why did you choose to attend gonzaga neblett i learned about it through the basketball team once i started looking into the business school and the university as a whole it seemed like the right fit for me sr what led to your starting your own business neblett i took a class called creating new ventures taught by adjunct professor tom simpson i expected it to be more or less a glorified science project but then we won a businessplan competition that included gonzaga eastern whitworth and wsu and that gave us the credibility to raise  and launch greencupboards sr were you personally interested in green products back then neblett sarah was more into that – things like organic makeup i was more focused on the sales side of business and saw an opportunity i believed if we made buying a green product easy for people and offered it at a price comparable to the alternative most people would choose the sustainable option sr how do you compete with web giants such as amazon green neblett amazon is our biggest competition – onethird of all online retail transactions happen on amazon but we look at marketplaces like amazon and ebay more as partners than competitors because we leverage their expertise to sell our products sr how can you compete on price neblett of the  suppliers we work with i’d say we’re among the top three retailers for  percent of them sometimes we’re their biggest account sr did you have a mentor neblett tom simpson who cofounded the company with sarah and me has very much been my mentor throughout this process sr what lessons have proved most useful neblett one of his catch phrases that i keep in mind is “only the paranoid survive” because online retail is so competitive another is “get out of the wheat and into the sky” as my role has evolved from developing a business model to building a worldclass team i’ve needed to delegate more and set aside enough time to plan for the company’s next step sr was the business successful from the start neblett we don’t like to use the word “successful” – again that paranoid attitude we’re profitable and selfsustaining and on pace to be successful but i wouldn’t consider us successful today sr how long did it take greencupboards to turn a profit neblett two years but we weren’t killing ourselves in the meantime the typical model in online retail is to raise tens of millions of dollars and then lose money for years as you try to acquire market share that worked for drugstorecom and diaperscom but you don’t hear about the  percent that it didn’t work for sr you launched your company just as the economy was sinking into recession did that worry you neblett some of the best success stories in history have come from companies that were started as the economy was sinking sr give me a for instance neblett uh … i’ll email you a couple sr did you ever worry that greencupboards might fail neblett of course total sales during our first six months were  our top seller was a toilet bowl cleaner sr what have been some milestones neblett last year we acquired a competitor called ecomomcom they had launched in  and gone down that model i described – raised  million or  million and essentially squandered it when we absorbed them it made sense to rebrand our corporate name to etailz to reflect our growing array of products beyond those that meet our stringent criteria for green and etailz is generic enough that it can be an umbrella for new divisions new companies new ideas sr what do you like most about your job neblett i love the craziness entrepreneurs need a few loose screws in the head and i definitely think i have those i love coming to work each day and then going home and still working sr what do you like least neblett a lot of people wouldn’t like the constant change the quick decisions – our readyfireaim approach but back in the day when ibm was the industry leader they had so many layers of bureaucracy that they’d waste months weighing decisions that sounded good the day someone came up with them our readyfireaim mentality lets us move quickly learn and adapt sr your mission statement mentions three goals to sustain amaze and delight what’s an example of amaze neblett you amaze the customer by overdelivering – by doing something above and beyond what they expect such as refunding their shipping fee if a product arrives later than expected and our customers aren’t just the consumers we obsess just as much on our suppliers – how we can help them grow their sales sr how do you decide which products to carry neblett we look at our key competitors’ best sellers – which categories are hot and we go to a lot of trade shows to find upandcoming products that fit our niche sr what do you look for when hiring neblett first and foremost you have to fit our culture if you don’t i don’t care how smart you are sr how would you characterize that culture neblett fun dynamic entrepreneurial some people are better suited for a to bank job and there’s nothing wrong with that but we need people who are going to stay up late and get up early thinking about work – how they can make something better and they need to enjoy coming to the office and not be a debbie downer sr are most of your employees young neblett relatively the average age has risen as we’ve hired more managers also the fact that our earliest employees were  when we hired them and now they’re    – it’s rising that way sr are you planning to hire more employees this year neblett we’re in nonstop hiring mode we currently have  job postings sr do you see etailz as a buyout candidate neblett not really i believe building the company to sell would lead to bad decisions we’re planning to be here  or  years from now it’s naive to say a strategic partnership or acquisition couldn’t happen but it’s not something we spend any time focusing on sr what would it cost to start a business like this today neblett the marketplace has changed so rapidly that i’m not sure you could build a website like ours today unless you were willing to start out losing millions of dollars sr what do your parents think of your career neblett i showed up during winter break from school and said “i don’t know anything about ecommerce or retail i know i have

edition  february    executive excellence awardsetailz   what has rapidly become a thriving supplierfocused online retailer was built on the foundation of another dream josh neblett confesses that his initial venture greencupboardscom was a “glorified science project” in its effort to develop and sell environmentally friendly household products online after raising  in investment it booked only  in sales its first year neblett learned however that he could help solve the kinds of problems his suppliers were experiencing “suppliers aren’t treated as a customer by a retailer” he explains “they’re often squeezed” after changing greencupboards’ name to etailz in  the yearold graduate of gonzaga university and his cofounder and former professor tom simpson now help more than  suppliers with their

under the etailz umbrella — ecomomcom is another — providing an ongoing reminder of its ambitious beginning“that bootstrap mentality” neblett notes “allowed us to continue and innovate”  related

greencupboardscom  ceo we tell your story to the world menu home about contact search previous page search “it’s not all about shopping … we try to impart our own witty receptive and youthful office culture to anyone who clicksin” february    josh neblett this interview was made possible by our friends at domainnamesalescom   the marketplace for domain names greencupboardscom was cofounded by students josh neblett and sarah wollnick with professor tom simpson after winning the spokane regional university business plan competition while attending gonzaga university they want to be your greenliving guides for the ecosavvy trailblazer within their goal is to provide you with accurate and useful information to aid your transition to more sustainable living greencupboardscom is an online retailer of environmentally friendly products for homes and businesses the company differentiates itself by offering a vast array of products pursuing multiple channels of distribution providing exquisite customer service and serving as a source of intriguing content mo what has the evolutionary process of greencupboardscom been from winning a competition for best business plan to actually putting your business model into practice were there any major differences or changes in how your idea looked on paper to what it was like to actually implement in the real world josh to say the least going from a homework assignment to business plan to marketplace hasn’t been without its hurdles originally we bundled products together in “cupboards” for kitchens bathrooms and pets assortments we thought would be useful to customers however we quickly discovered that customers preferred to pick and choose products rather than buying a parcel of what we thought would work for them we’re continually changing reforming and adapting to customer needs yes this even involves tweaking our own workflow so our evolution consists of regular modification to make the greencupboardscom shopping experience varietyfilled educational and user friendly mo how hard was it to put together such an impressive network of environmentally friendly and sustainable products on such a large scale josh compiling an extensive variety of ecofriendly products has been a collaborative effort on behalf of the entire greencupboardscom team while product research is undertaken by our green compliance and competition committees we encourage employees to keep their eyes open for new innovative “green” products to add to our repertoire our supplier relations team attends annual conferences and trade shows hence a yearly fluctuation in what we add to our stockpile our wide array of products over  sku’s plays a large role in our goal of becoming a market leader so expanding our product web is part of the jet fuel behind our development this conglomerate approach also encourages personnel to engage in proprietorship of what we sell alongside continual efforts to diversify the products we would like to offer in the future … call it our affinity for looking forward mo where does your passion for the green movement come from were you raised to be environmentally conscious or was it more of spotting a great opportunity in a niche market josh i’d say it’s a mixture of both the practice of recycling and buying lowimpact goods is appealing our office recycles and depending on the weather the majority of our employee’s bike walk carpool or use public transit to commute it just makes sense to take care of the planet riding on the recent ecoconsciousness wave we identified the large and growing demand for onestop shopping for an exceptional variety of ecofriendly products and leapt at the opportunity mo greencupboardscom is experiencing impressive growth and profitability how have you managed to gain such serious traction since launching in  and why do you think that the trend towards a greener lifestyle is gaining serious momentum josh to be sure the use of multiple marketplaces boosts our web presence it’s hard to pin the exact reason greener living is catching on so quickly while the trend may be due to media attention on environmental issues and increased consciousness about what products decrease a consumer’s environmental footprint the ease of access to a wide variety of these products at greencupboardscom has provided a real spur for customer traffic plus we try to impart our own witty receptive and youthful office culture to shoppers to enrich their experience from just another clickandbuy routine to an ecoboosting memorable interaction mo how important has the process of educating consumers on making more sustainable choices been in growing the company josh giving customers the option to research and interact with a particular product enables us to engage in a dialogue with shoppers explaining why we choose to sell a certain item and providing them with adequate information on a product’s uses origins ingredients warnings certifications awards and why it is “green” we don’t want our shoppers left guessing we’re here to guide them so the provision of product information helps greencupboardscom establish an informative as well as diverse shopping experience mo you have set your sights on international expansion how much will you need to pivot your business model in order to reach a greater audience outside of the us josh going international is a big step so we’re in the process of revamping our business model to accommodate a move abroad one of my primary concerns is maintaining our aboveandbeyond customer service in nonenglish speaking markets it’s an exciting move but requires us to look at ourselves from the perspective of customers overseas not an easy move but selfcritical
