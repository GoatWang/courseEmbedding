second quarter revenue surged  or  when adjusting for the sale of its security operations macafee early in the quarter client computing group revenue was up an amazing  attributable mostly to an  increase in average selling prices management pointed to strength in the gaming segment and a strong core mix admittedly the comp was not so difficult since last year revenue in this segment dropped  data center revenue rose  while memory solutions revenue rocketed  in response to the strong revenue growth its improved outlook for the pc business and the expectation for an earlier close of the mobileye transaction management raised its guidance for full year revenue by  billion the revision was notable in that although the pc market is still shrinking and primary competitor advance micro devices posted excellent results earlier in the week intel is still generating impressive growth last years operating income was horrible so the comparisons are not meaningful but margins were better than the first quarter margins are being constrained by the losses in the memory solutions segment or they would be even better intel added  billion of debt in q so even though ebitda should be significantly higher this year because of much better revenue and improved margins leverage is likely to climb to x versus x at the end of  the debt was likely added in anticipation of the mobileye

with trivago  and homeaway  leadingearnings by dave novosel cfasecond quarter revenue soared  at expedia with trivago  and homeaway  leading the way core ota by far its largest segment posted a  increase in revenue egencia easily the smallest segment saw an  increase in revenue revenue was boosted by a  increase in room nights stayed which more than offset the  decline in revenue per room night ebitda margins declined  basis points margins in the core ota and egencia segments were relatively flat but margins were considerably lower in the homeaway and trivago units the overall decrease was due mostly to higher marketing expenses the aggressive marketing spending will likely run through the rest of the year putting some pressure on margins but given the explosive topline growth the spending is certainly worthwhile as usual free cash flow was outstanding in q and expe is on track to generate more than  million this year we estimate that share repurchases will be a little more than  million while the company has spent  million on acquisitions through the first half expe also announced it is making a  million minority investment in traveloka the leading online travel company

admittedly the comp was not so difficult since last year revenue in this segment dropped  data center revenue rose  while memory solutions revenue rocketed  in response to the strong revenue growth its improved outlook for the pc business and the expectation for an earlier close of the mobileye transaction management raised its guidance for full year revenue by  billion the revision was notable in that although the pc market is still shrinking and primary competitor advance micro devices posted excellent results earlier in the week intel is still generating impressive growth last years operating income was horrible so the comparisons are not meaningful but margins were better than the first quarter margins are being constrained by the losses in the memory solutions segment or they would be even better intel added  billion of debt in q so even though ebitda should be significantly higher this year because of much better revenue and improved margins leverage is likely to climb to

increase in room nights stayed which more than offset the  decline in revenue per room night ebitda margins declined  basis points margins in the core ota and egencia segments were relatively flat but margins were considerably lower in the homeaway and trivago units the overall decrease was due mostly to higher marketing expenses the aggressive marketing spending will likely run through the rest of the year putting some pressure on margins but given the explosive topline growth the spending is certainly worthwhile as usual free cash flow was outstanding in q and expe is on track to generate more
