iii the identification of other areas in the packaging industry that can most benefit from our ability to deliver quality packaging products according to our customers needs including the leveraging

development and application of advanced manufacturing technologies and the establishment of manufacturing facilities in strategic international markets key transactions acquisition of asg north american mexican and china print and packaging operations on november   we completed the acquisition of the north american and asian print businesses of agi global holdings co�peratief ua and agi shorewood group us holdings llc collectively asg the acquisition of asg a manufacturer of print and packaging in the united states canada mexico and china expands our global network and customer base asg had annual sales of approximately  million for the twelve months ending immediately prior to the date of the acquisition acquisition of presentation products on february   we completed the

manufacturer located in the united kingdom and has import and china sourcing offices located in hong kong china presentation specializes in high end consumer packaging with an emphasis in the spirits market presentation had annual sales of approximately  million for the twelve months ending immediately prior to the date of the acquisition acquisition of bp media on july   we completed the

interchangeability of print content for foreign locations in addition blueprint provides us with an established sales presence in the media markets in europe which will enable us to serve the european needs of global media releases blueprint had annual sales of approximately  million for the twelve months immediately prior to the date of acquisition table of contents acquisition of chicago paper tube and can on january   we completed the acquisition of chicago paper tube and can cpt cpt provides the company with high end round rigid packaging capability in north america cpt had annual sales of approximately  million for the twelve months immediately prior to the date of acquisition acquisition accounting all of the transactions described above were accounted for as a purchase business combination accordingly in all cases the assets and liabilities of the acquired or merged entities were recorded at fair value as of the respective closing dates and the results of operations of the entities are included in our results of operations from the date of closing reorganizationsrestructuring the company announced the closure of the former asg facility located in melrose park illinois on september   with an anticipated completion date of february  the company recorded restructuring expenses of approximately  million in the quarter ended september   due primarily to the announced closure the underlying facility is leased on a monthtomonth basis in addition to the restructuring expense recorded in september the company incurred duplicative costs associated with the transfer of melrose park work to other facilities and as such recorded incremental restructuring expense in the quarter ended december   of approximately  million trends general information our largest customers are generally large multinational entities many of which are consolidating global packaging requirements under a smaller number of suppliers we believe we are favorably situated for this transition due to our many facilities global footprint standardized equipment from plant to plant and our relative size to other packaging suppliers the packaging marketplace is very fragmented with no one vendor providing a significant portion of the packaging needs net sales trends net sales are impacted by the macroeconomic performance of our geographic segments and the markets within these geographic segments packaging net sales tend to be strongest just before the underlying customers busy season which for highend branded products is generally strongest in our first and second fiscal quarters healthcare net sales in each of our geographic segments are influenced by the severity of a particular regions cold and flu seasons as well as the development and acceptance of certain new products and the stage of product from the prescriptiononly stage to the private label or generic stage european consumer net sales of confectionary products are generally stronger in our second quarter due to the holiday season north american and european consumer net sales of spirits are also generally stronger in our second quarter due to the holiday season asia consumer net sales of spirits are generally stronger in their holiday season generally in our third fiscal quarter the net sales to the north american multimedia end market are influenced by the success of a particular years movie releases which can generate special packaging needs for these customers net sales of packaging in the north american video game market are generally influenced by the age of existing and introduction of new gaming platforms product launches which cannot be predicted far in advance have an impact on net sales particularly with respect to special packaging needed for the holiday season overall we expect our multimedia net sales to continue to decline as a percentage of our total net sales impact of inflation and pricing we have not historically been and do not expect to be significantly impacted by inflation increases in payroll costs and any increases in raw material costs that we have encountered are generally able to be offset through lean manufacturing activities we have consistently made annual investments in capital that deliver efficiencies and cost savings the benefits of these efforts generally offset the margin impact of competitive pricing conditions in all of the markets we serve we remain sensitive to price competitiveness in the markets that we serve and in the areas that are targeted for growth and believe that the installation of stateoftheart printing and manufacturing equipment as well as utilization of lean manufacturing and related labor and production efficiencies will enable us to compete effectively table of contents operational restructurings we regularly evaluate our operating facilities in our geographic segments in order to determine how to allocate our resources share best practices ensure logistics that serve customers are appropriate and maximize our operating efficiencies in connection with these evaluations we have closed certain facilities in recent periods results of operations quarter ended december   compared

december   was  million or  when compared to the quarter ended december   the increase is due to the inclusion of sales from the acquired operations of asg presentation products and bp media which were acquired in november  february  and july  respectively net sales were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency changes principally from translation differences of approximately  million net sales adjusted for the acquisitions had they been included since the beginning of the period were  million for the three months ended december   a difference of  million from the gaap net sales for the three months ended december   the difference is primarily attributable to the foreign exchange impact noted previously as well as a reduction in general multimedia sales of  million and a decline in two consumer products companies sales of approximately  million table of contents we operate our business along the following operating segments which are grouped based on the basis of geographic region north america europe and asia net sales by geographic segment as further broken down by end market are summarized as follows net sales by geographic segment three months ended december  dollars

november  increased consumer healthcare and multimedia sales due to that acquisition serving those end markets all industry sales were higher due to the asg acquisition however overall sales trends in multimedia are expected to continue to decline and absent the acquisition activity would have declined multimedia sales are declining due to the change in delivery systems towards digital delivery via downloads or online and payperview systems our sales are reflective of the overall trend in the multimedia end market sales related to acquired businesses are evaluated as to profitability and optimization of manufacturing facility and if they are core to the companys ongoing business strategy as a result the company can exit business that was not profitable or core to its business and can move manufacturing to facilities that optimize the manufacturing effectiveness north america the increase in north american net sales for the three months ended december   was  million or  when

north american consumer net sales for the quarter ended december   was  million or  when compared to the quarter ended december   the increase in north american multimedia sales for the quarter ended december   was  million or  when compared to the quarter ended december   all of these increases are primarily a result of the asg acquisition completed on november   asg had a majority of its business operations in north america adjusted for acquisitions in fiscal  north american sales were  million in the quarter ended december   compared to  million for the quarter ended december   the decrease is principally due to the previously mentioned consumer product companies sales and negative foreign exchange of approximately  million although north american multimedia sales increased for the quarter ended december   when compared to the quarter ended december   by  million this increase was principally due to the inclusion of the sales from the acquired asg operations in the quarter ended december   the acquired asg operations were integrated immediately upon acquisition and as a result it is not possible to isolate the portion of revenues attributable to the asg operations however had the asg acquisition not occurred multimedia sales would have declined for the quarter ended december   table of contents europe the decrease in europe net sales for the quarter ended

quarter ended december   primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on a constant currency basis european health care sales remained relatively flat the decrease in europe consumer net sales for the quarter ended december   was  million or  when compared to the quarter ended december   and is due to negative foreign exchange impacts before foreign exchange consumer increased

of asg in november  gross margin percentage for the quarter ended december   was  an increase of  basis points compared to  for the quarter ended december   the increase is reflecting the companys continuing facility improvement programs and realized synergies from acquisitions offset by restructuring charges and plant closure selling general and administrative expenses total selling general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended december   were  million an increase of  million when compared to the prior period the increase is principally due to stock compensation charges
