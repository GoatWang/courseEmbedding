understanding cost basis understanding escheatment sector investing sector investing to achieve average performance investors often buy mutual funds based on a broad market index the sp  index for example managing a fund to an index is often called passive management because there is no active stock selection being done by a managerthe fund simply tracks the holdings of a particular indexbroad market indices track companies across a wide spectrum of industries making such index funds more diversified and less volatile than singlesector funds and better able to weather downturns in any single industry the stocks in the sp  index are selected by standard  poors based on size stability and liquidity this index is typically used to represent the broad us market and includes a representative sampling of companies in the automotive health care technology retail financial and other industries benefits of active management active management enables fund managers to try to achieve the funds investment objective without being tied to a particular index firsthands mutual funds are actively managed unlike passive index managers active managers may invest in promising stocks that are not included in any index they also have the freedom to allocate assets as they see fit in other words they are not tied to any prescribed index weightings eg by market capitalization similarly active managers are able to sell companies that may be in an index but are not performing well it should also be noted that active management carries certain risks as well including the risk that an active managers investment style may be in or out of favor with the market which could reduce returns narrowing the universe when you look at the component industries of the sp  index youll find some groups of industries that over different time periods surge past or lag behind the broad market sector funds invest in one specific area of the economy technology or health care or financial services or utilities or retail etc by focusing a portion of your assets in sectors that enjoy strong longterm prospects you can help position your portfolio to seek solid returns firsthand offers two sector funds firsthand technology opportunities fund and firsthand alternative energy fund why buy a sector fund adding a sector fund to your portfolio begins with your own experience and understanding of broad economic trends before owning any sector fund you should feel comfortable with that sectors longterm prospects and the risks involved you ought to consider whether you believe that the sector has the potential to outperform the broad market over the long term an investment in a sector fund does not by itself constitute a balanced portfolio and is not appropriate if your key goal is preservation of capital sector funds by their very nature are more risky investments than their more diversified counterparts there are things you can do however to mitigate the risks presented by sector investments plan to invest for the long termat least three to five years depending on your goals focus only a portion of your total portfolio in sector investments consider
