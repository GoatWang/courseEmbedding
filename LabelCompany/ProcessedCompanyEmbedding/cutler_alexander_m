chairman and chief executive officer of the company that had become the secondlargest manufacturer of hydraulic equipment and the largest maker of truck transmissions in the united states eaton

manufacture of fluid power systems distribution and control systems automotive parts aerospace equipment and electrical power quality distribution and control systems company growth through mergers acquisitions and divestitures cutler began his career in  as a financial analyst with cutlerhammer created in milwaukee wisconsin in  by harry t cutler who bore no relation to alexander cutler

became a pioneer in electricity control through further acquisitions and the development of  patents cutlerhammers sales soared from  in  to  million in  the young eaton corporation which began in  in

cutlerhammer in —and along with it cutler who became a division controller he was promoted to manager of the power distribution division in  and general manager of the industrial control and power

surpassing direct current as the world standard in electricity delivery in the th century westinghouse became a nuclearenergy powerhouse supplying nucleargenerated electricity to the navy national defense systems television companies and the general populace cutler was looking to make eaton a major player in the electricaldistribution and control industry and was impressed with the strategic directional change westinghouse had made in that sector during the late s and early s in january  eaton merged westinghouse into its cutlerhammer division in what became one of the biggest acquisitions in the electric industrys history throughout the s eaton made  acquisitions while divesting itself of  less profitable divisions in  cutler was named chairman ceo and president of the

councils web site declared eaton plays for keeps—if it cant win it doesnt play a philosophy clearly evident in cutlers management style robert sherefkin wrote in crains cleveland business  alexander cutler the new chief executive officer of eaton corporation has wasted little time shaking up the supplier september   after rising to the head of the company he almost immediately announced plans to sell off eatons cockpitswitch business which manufactured switches used in automobile door locks mirrors seats and windows cutler made the decision to sell the business while it was still profitable its sales the previous year had totaled  million proceeds from the sale were used to pay off debt or reinvested in the company allowing eaton to focus more heavily on its engine and drivetrain divisions sherefkin wrote that according to analyst kent mortensen of robert w baird  company of milwaukee the probable reason for cutlers decision was that eaton had not developed the critical mass to lead the consolidation of vehicle interiors where its switches are used so it was fish or cut bait and they decided to cut bait september   in his ceo message on eatons web site cutler wrote eaton has changed we have transformed our company from a manufacturer of vehicle components into a diversified industrial enterprise cutler always searched for the most lucrative mix of products acquiring and divesting appropriately in order to achieve that goal as the demand for cars and trucks decreased he focused more heavily on the industrial and commercial controls divisions he led eaton to take advantage of two huge challenges that the auto industry faced improving both gas mileage and emission controls he also readily positioned the company to avail itself of the opportunity that was presented and missed by many electric companies when the industry deregulated and the demand for power surged in an article in tirekicking today  cutler was reported as saying its necessary to know what adds true value to a product and what does not who are the value creators and who are the value destroyers september  growth under his leadership after cutler became chairman and ceo eaton spun off its semiconductorequipment business which became axcelis technologies and of which cutler became a board member in a series of moves that evoked images of a game of monopoly on an international scale in  eaton purchased sumifomo heavy industries  percent share in a fluidpower joint venture which became eatons first wholly owned japanese business eaton then sold its switchelectronics division for  million and later became lockheed martins primary fluidpower system supplier for the billiondollar joint strike fighter program the subsequent additions of several other such contracts brought eatons aerospaceindustry sales to almost  billion within a sixmonth period cutler noted that the joint strike fighter contract in particular was a major win for eaton proving that they were forerunners in the research and development of highpressure fluidpower systems for aircraft attesting to cutlers vision for streamlining eatons product line the company sold its navy controls business in  for  million bought the remaining  percent interest in its jining eaton hydraulica company in china acquired the hose tubing and fluidpower systems connector division of dana corporation for  million and bought mechanical products line of aerospace circuit breakers eaton later won an  million contract with the boeing company to provide highpressure hydraulic and other systems for the us air force in  it acquired commonwealth sprague capacitors power systems and the electrical division of londonbased delta when introducing cutler to a class of students at the tuck school of business at dartmouth college instructor sydney finkelstein noted that one of the major principles in mergers and acquisitions ma was that they must augment regenerate or create new competitive advantages finkelstein pointed out that spearheaded by cutler eaton had done just that and as such represents a great opportunity to see the ma principle in action perspective on people principles and partnerships in an interview with design news  cutler stressed the importance of teamwork among design engineers and the need for those engineers to get out of the lab into the marketplace and around customers he said that people who design products for a consumer must know what the consumer wants and understand his problems and that meeting with customers was not just necessary it was mandatory thats really how you get the creative juices running and its how you ensure that youre solving the problems your customers really need solved he said march   during the interview cutler said that the rapidly changing environment puts a tremendous premium on employee speed and flexibility his philosophy however was simplify first automate second rather than using technology to replace employees he preferred to use technology as a way to help them become more productive and flexible when asked by the interviewer how such a huge company could remain efficient cutler commented that the most important factor was communication which meant moving away from the traditional management style and becoming a facilitator a coach a communicator whatever word you want to use march   cutler wrote in his ceo website message that while eatons business had changed their principles had not he noted three fundamental principles he believed helped eaton grow as a business and its employees grow as individuals innovation—we value innovation and change as a source of strength impact—highperformance products employees and operations make a positive impact on the world around us and integrity—we care about how we get results he wrote eaton values eaton people and the power of one integrated operating company are what make us strong theyre also what drives our success managing assets and education cutler believed that to keep his company on the cutting edge it was essential to provide its employees with continuing education and efficiently manage its assets with the goal of transforming his workforce in mind he was a major proponent of the eaton business system an extensive and sweeping program to systematically monitor the companys assets and employees cutlers idea was to remove what he called the silos or barriers from between each business unit in order for managers to learn from each others experiences eaton university was launched shortly after cutlers rise to chairman and ceo it began as an instructorbased managementtraining program but soon became an elearning facility quickly added to the original elibrary was a wealth of material acquired from an outside organization and general business courses were later added that trained managers to set performance goals reward employee performance develop coaching skills and provide general career development on the alchemy web site cutler commented that the program was about capturing the benefits of diversity scale and rapid transfer for best practices and turning that into the power of one december   trim to survive in the process of keeping eaton profitable and on the cutting edge cutler had the unpleasant responsibility of cutting jobs between  and  eaton closed  factories and slashed  jobs even though the cockpitswitch works was only a small part of eatons huge automotive components group its sale eliminated more than four thousand employees in eight plants in north america south america and europe while cutler did what he felt was necessary for his companys overall health he remained aware of the effects it had on individuals the taipei times reported that cutler said in an interview when you go through the kind of human trauma that organizations go through when they downsize theres a very natural tendency to be very very careful about how you add back resources november   after the general downturn of the us economy in the early s cutler announced in  that the previous year had been a very good one fourthquarter earnings in  surpassed expectations with sales growth

ohio  httpwebeatoncom ■ in less than  years with eaton corporation alexander m cutler became president chairman and chief executive officer of the company that had become the secondlargest manufacturer of hydraulic equipment and the largest maker of truck transmissions in the united states eaton started out as a provider of automotive parts cutlers vision and his ability to act upon that vision made him highly instrumental in the diversification of the company into the multinational manufacture of fluid power systems distribution and control systems automotive parts aerospace equipment and electrical power quality distribution and control systems company growth through mergers acquisitions and divestitures cutler began his career in  as a financial analyst with cutlerhammer created in milwaukee wisconsin in  by harry t cutler who bore no relation to alexander cutler franklin s terry and edward west hammer the company first patented a starting box for motors through an acquisition it added rheostats and light dimmers for theaters to its product line and eventually became a pioneer in electricity control through further acquisitions and the development of  patents cutlerhammers sales soared from  in  to  million in  the young eaton corporation which began in  in bloomfield new jersey when j o eaton henning o taube and v v torbensen started the torbensen gear and axle company also grew largely through acquisitions in its first year the company manufactured seven truck axles by hand six years later it produced  axles by  it had undergone more than a dozen mergers and acquisitions vastly expanding its line of automotive products eaton acquired cutlerhammer in —and along with it cutler who became a division controller he was promoted to manager of the power distribution division in  and general manager of the industrial control and power distribution operations for the united states before long cutler had his eye on westinghouse the electricindustry giant that in the late s developed the component that led to alternating current surpassing direct current as the world standard in electricity delivery in the th century westinghouse became a nuclearenergy powerhouse supplying nucleargenerated electricity to the navy national defense systems television companies and the general populace cutler was looking to make eaton a major player in the electricaldistribution and control industry and was impressed with the strategic directional change westinghouse had made in that sector during the late s and early s in january  eaton merged westinghouse into its cutlerhammer division in what became one of the biggest acquisitions in the electric industrys history throughout the s eaton made  acquisitions while divesting itself of  less profitable divisions in  cutler was named chairman ceo and president of the company by  eaton boasted  employees and had manufacturing facilities in more than  countries and product sales in more than  a man of action a brief description of eaton on the national leadership councils web site declared eaton plays for keeps—if it cant win it doesnt play a philosophy clearly evident in cutlers management style robert sherefkin wrote in crains cleveland business alexander cutler the new chief executive officer of eaton corporation has wasted little time shaking up the supplier september   after rising to the head of the company he almost immediately announced plans to sell off eatons cockpitswitch business which manufactured switches used in automobile door locks mirrors seats and windows cutler made the decision to sell the business while it was still profitable its sales the previous year had totaled  million proceeds from the sale were used to pay off debt or reinvested in the company allowing eaton to focus more heavily on its engine and drivetrain divisions sherefkin wrote that according to analyst kent mortensen of robert w baird  company of milwaukee the probable reason for cutlers decision was that eaton had not developed the critical mass to lead the consolidation of vehicle interiors where its switches are used so it was fish or cut bait and they decided to cut bait september   in his ceo message on eatons web site cutler wrote eaton has changed we have transformed our company from a manufacturer of vehicle components into a diversified industrial enterprise cutler always searched for the most lucrative mix of products acquiring and divesting appropriately in order to achieve that goal as the demand for cars and trucks decreased he focused more heavily on the industrial and commercial controls divisions he led eaton to take advantage of two huge challenges that the auto industry faced improving both gas mileage and emission controls he also readily positioned the company to avail itself of the opportunity that was presented and missed by many electric companies when the industry deregulated and the demand for power surged in an article in tirekicking today cutler was reported as saying its necessary to know what adds true value to a product and what does not who are the value creators and who are the value destroyers september  growth under his leadership after cutler became chairman and ceo eaton spun off its semiconductorequipment business which became axcelis technologies and of which cutler became a board member in a series of moves that evoked images of a game of monopoly on an international scale in  eaton purchased sumifomo heavy industries  percent share in a fluidpower joint venture which became eatons first wholly owned japanese business eaton then sold its switchelectronics division for  million and later became lockheed martins primary fluidpower system supplier for the billiondollar joint strike fighter program the subsequent additions of several other such contracts brought eatons aerospaceindustry sales to almost  billion within a sixmonth period cutler noted that the joint strike fighter contract in particular was a major win for eaton proving that they were forerunners in the research and development of highpressure fluidpower systems for aircraft attesting to cutlers vision for streamlining eatons product line the company sold its navy controls business in  for  million bought the remaining  percent interest in its jining eaton hydraulica company in china acquired the hose
