centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than

investment management napa valley “our focus at rbo is to partner with clients as their investment manager and to preserve and grow their capital through the consistent application of a disciplined investment methodology” – jack oliver managing partner about rbo rbo is an investment manager serving individuals family offices and institutions we specialize in acquiring equity positions in publiclytraded companies with competitive advantages exceptional leadership and that we believe are significantly undervalued our dedication to longterm relationships and the consistent application of our investment approach have allowed us to protect and grow client capital for more than three decades as an independent investment advisor we follow a commitment to honor and serve our clients strive to be a symbol of integrity in the investment management business and hold ourselves accountable to the highest measures of transparency our dedication to providing superior results for our clients has never wavered key elements of rbo’s investment approach independent research independent research is the foundation of our investment approach and we believe a key differentiator from our peers we believe in the importance of onsite company visits with senior management teams as well as the importance of analyzing competitors customers and suppliers concentrated portfolios diversification is important and we believe it can be effectively achieved by owning  companies across industries and geographies by owning a limited number of companies we invest only in our highest conviction ideas longterm perspective we believe the market frequently misprices stocks due to misinterpretation inattention emotion and a shortterm outlook because of our longterm horizon we can think differently from the crowd and use these opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive valuations global exposure our portfolios are not bound by geographic constraints we generally believe that we achieve international exposure by owning domestic companies with operations outside of the united states minimized costs since we view stocks as ownership stakes in businesses we do not trade frequently in an attempt to generate shortterm gains by trading infrequently rbo limits taxes and trading costs two of the most common pitfalls of active managers risk management we define risk as a permanent loss of capital and not by market volatility we assess risk from both a qualitative and quantitative viewpoint by analyzing our investments one at a time believing the best risk management method is by

imply a certain level of skill or training rbo is headquartered in saint helena ca rbo  co  philosophy at rbo we manage portfolios with a single unified investment philosophy utilizing a common sense investment approach we seek out undervalued companies by conducting intensive fundamental research and investment due diligence our investments generally meet these three criteria competitively advantaged we invest in businesses that we believe possess distinct competitive advantages which include high barriers to entry limited competition strong financial position high returns on capital and consistent and growing free cash flow generation historically we have found businesses with sustainable competitive advantages earn a disproportionate share of industry profits and investment returns strong management teams we seek able and proven management teams that can articulate and implement the required strategies to maintain competitive positioning management teams must also possess a shareholderoriented mentality that includes returning excess capital to the owners of the business the shareholders undervalued prices we require entry prices that are considerably less than what we believe the companies are worth we demand a “margin of safety” so that our client capital is protected against unforeseen risks the degree of this discount is an integral factor in determining the amount of client capital allocated to a particular investment investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike benjamin graham the intelligent investor  “every equity position is an

to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm

differentiator from our peers we believe in the importance of onsite company visits with senior management teams as well as the importance of analyzing competitors customers and suppliers concentrated portfolios diversification is important and we believe it can be effectively achieved by owning  companies across industries and geographies by owning a limited number of companies we invest only in our highest conviction ideas longterm perspective we believe the market frequently misprices stocks due to misinterpretation inattention emotion and a shortterm outlook because of our longterm horizon we can think differently from the crowd and use these opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive valuations global exposure our portfolios are not bound by geographic constraints we generally believe that we achieve international exposure by owning domestic companies with operations outside of the united states minimized costs since we view stocks as ownership stakes in businesses we do not trade frequently in an attempt to generate shortterm gains by trading infrequently rbo limits taxes and trading costs two of the most common pitfalls of active managers risk management we define risk as a permanent loss of capital and not by market volatility we assess risk from both a qualitative and quantitative viewpoint by analyzing our investments one at a time believing the best risk
