exchange commission on march   while these forwardlooking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business actual results will almost always vary sometimes materially from any estimates predictions projections assumptions or other future performance suggested herein except as required by applicable law including the securities laws of the united states we do not intend to update any of the forwardlooking statements to conform these statements to actual results history watchtower inc was incorporated on february   in the state of nevada the company was originally focused on becoming involved in the growing market for renewable and environmentally sustainable energy and intended to market and resell agricultural based biodiesel fuels our goal was to source various available agribiodiesel fuel products from many producers internationally and offer renewable alternatives to petroleum based fuels in the united states due to the state of the economy the company has conducted virtually no business other than organizational matters filing its registration statement on form sb which was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission the sec on august   the registration statement and filings of periodic reports with the sec the company has since abandoned its business plan and is now seeking an operating company with which to merge or to acquire we are now considered a blank check company the us securities and exchange commission the sec defines those companies as any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section  a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies under sec rule b under the securities act of  as amended the securities act we also qualify as a shell company because we have no or nominal assets other than cash and no or nominal operations many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination we intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as we are subject to those requirements watchtowers current business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into watchtower in certain instances a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of watchtower or may wish to contribute or sell assets to watchtower rather than to merge no assurances can be given that watchtower will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company watchtower seeks to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting or public company whose securities are qualified for trading in the united states secondary markets  a business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of watchtower and the substitution by the target company of its own management and board of directors no assurances can be given that watchtower will be able to enter into a business combination or if watchtower does enter into such a business combination no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination or as to the nature of the target company plan of operation general during the next  months the company intends to seek investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire an interest in one or more business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of a publicly held corporation at this time the company has no plan proposal agreement understanding or arrangement to acquire or merge with any specific business or company and the company has not identified any specific business or company for investigation and evaluation no member of management or promoter of the company has had any material discussions with any other company with respect to any acquisition of that company the company will not restrict its search to any specific business industry or geographical location and the company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature the discussion of the proposed plan of operation under this caption and throughout this quarterly report is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of the companys virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities sources of opportunities the company anticipates that business opportunities for possible acquisition will be referred by various sources including its officers and directors professional advisors securities brokerdealers venture capitalists members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals the company will seek a potential business opportunity from all known sources but will rely principally on personal contacts of its officers and directors as well as indirect associations between them and other business and professional people it is not presently anticipated that the company will engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations the officers and directors of the company are currently employed in other positions and will devote only a portion of their time not more than three hours per week to the business affairs of the company until such time as an acquisition has been determined to be highly favorable at which time they expect to spend full time in investigating and closing any acquisition for a period of two weeks in addition in the face of competing demands for their time the officers and directors may grant priority to their fulltime positions rather than to the company evaluation of opportunities the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the company management intends to concentrate on identifying prospective business opportunities which may be brought to its attention through present associations with management in analyzing prospective business opportunities management will consider such matters as the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and other financial requirements history of operation if any prospects for the future present and expected competition the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management the potential for further research development or exploration specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company the potential for growth or expansion the potential for profit the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products services or trades name identification and other relevant factors officers and directors of the company will meet personally with management and key personnel of the firm sponsoring the business opportunity as part of their investigation to the extent possible the company intends to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors the company will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained  acquisition of opportunities in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition the company may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture franchise or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity it may also purchase stock or assets of an existing business on the consummation of a transaction it is possible that the present management and shareholders of the company will not be in control of the company in addition a majority or all of the companys officers and directors may as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction resign and be replaced by new officers and directors without a vote of the companys shareholders it is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance on exemptions from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws in some circumstances however as a negotiated element of this transaction the company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated under certain conditions or at a specified time thereafter the issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the companys common stock may have a depressive effect on such market while the actual terms of a transaction to which the company may be a party cannot be predicted it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition in a so called tax free reorganization under sections a or  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code in order to obtain tax free treatment under the code it may be necessary for the owners of the acquired business to own  or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity in such event the shareholders of the company including investors in this offering would retain less than  of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity which could result in significant dilution in the equity of such shareholders as part of the companys investigation officers and directors of the company will meet personally with management and key personnel may visit and inspect material facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided check references of management and key personnel and take other reasonable investigative measures to the extent of the companys limited financial resources and management expertise the manner in which each company participates in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity the respective needs and desires of the company and other parties the management of the opportunity and the relative negotiating strength of the company and such other management with respect to any mergers or acquisitions negotiations with target company management will be expected to focus on the percentage of the company which target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings in the target company depending upon among other things the target companys assets and liabilities the companys shareholders will in all likelihood hold a lesser percentage ownership interest in the company following any merger or acquisition the percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event the company acquires a target company with substantial assets any merger or acquisition effected by the company can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by the companys then shareholders including purchasers in this offering the company will not have sufficient funds unless it is able to raise funds in a private placement to undertake any significant development marketing and manufacturing of any products which may be acquired accordingly following the acquisition of any such product the company will in all likelihood be required to either seek debt or equity financing or obtain funding from third parties in exchange for which the company would probably be required to give up a substantial portion of its interest in any acquired product there is no assurance that the company will be able either to obtain additional financing or interest third parties in providing funding for the further development marketing and manufacturing of any products acquired it is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others if a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity the costs therefore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable furthermore even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the company of the related costs incurred management believes that the company may be able to benefit from the use of leverage in the acquisition of a business opportunity leveraging a transaction involves the acquisition of a business through incurring significant indebtedness for a large percentage of the purchase price for that business  through a leveraged transaction the company would be required to use less of its available funds for acquiring the business opportunity and therefore could commit those funds to the operations of the business opportunity to acquisition of other business opportunities or to other activities the borrowing involved in a leveraged transaction would ordinarily be secured by the assets of the business opportunity to be acquired if the business opportunity acquired is not able to generate sufficient revenues to make payments on the debt incurred by the company to acquire that business opportunity the lender would be able to exercise the remedies provided by law or by contract these leveraging techniques while reducing the amount of funds that the company must commit to acquiring a business opportunity may correspondingly increase the risk of loss to the company no assurance can be given as to the terms or the availability of financing for any acquisition by the company during periods when interest rates are relatively high the benefits of leveraging are not as great as during periods of lower interest rates because the investment in the business opportunity held on a leveraged basis will only be profitable if it generates sufficient revenues to cover the related debt and other costs of the financing lenders from which the company may obtain funds for purposes of a leveraged buyout may impose restrictions on the future borrowing distribution and operating policies of the company it is not possible at this time to predict the restrictions if any which lenders may impose or the impact thereof on the company results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and in conjunction with the companys form k filed on march   results for interim periods may not be indicative of results for the full year results of operations for the three months ended september   compared to the three months ended september   revenues the company is in its development stage and did not generate any revenues for the three  months ended september   and september   total operating expenses during the three  months ended september   and  total operating expenses were  and  respectively which were primarily the result of fees for professional and accounting services associated with fulfilling the companys sec reporting requirements of the   consisted of professional fees and  consisted of general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended september    consisted of professional fees and  consisted of general and administrative expenses net loss during the three months ended september   and  the net loss was  and  respectively comparison of nine months ended september   and  revenues the company did not generate any revenues for the nine  months ended september   and september   total operating expenses during the nine  months ended september   and  total operating expenses were  and  respectively net loss during the nine months ended september   and  the net loss was  and  respectively  liquidity and capital resources our balance sheet as of september   reflects that the company had no cash the company is a blank check company and does not have any planned operations the total amount owed to a principal shareholder of the company at september   is  the loan bears interest at  per annum and is payable on demand the focus of watchtowers efforts is to acquire or develop an operating business despite no active operations at this time management intends to continue in business and has no intention to liquidate the company watchtower has considered various business alternatives including the possible acquisition of an existing business but to date has found possible opportunities unsuitable or excessively priced watchtower does not contemplate limiting the scope of its search to any particular industry management has considered the risk of possible opportunities as well as their potential rewards management has invested time evaluating several proposals for possible acquisition or combination however none of these opportunities were pursued watchtower presently owns no real property and at this time has no intention of acquiring any such property watchtowers primary expected expenses are comprised substantially of professional fees primarily incident to its reporting requirements we may have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us we currently have no agreements arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans lines of credit or any other sources going concern consideration the company is a development stage company and has not commenced planned principal operations the company had no revenues and incurred a net loss of  for the nine months ended september   and a net loss of  for the period february   inception to september   these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be generated during the next year or thereafter from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources the lack of additional capital could force the company to curtail or cease operations and would therefore have a material adverse effect on its business furthermore there can be no assurance that any such required funds if available will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the companys existing stockholders offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements nov   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights

watchtower inc “the company” was incorporated on february   under the laws of the state of nevada   the company has not generated revenues from planned principal operations the company has abandoned its business plan and is now seeking an operating company with which to merge or acquire accordingly the company is now considered a blank check company there is no assurance however that the company will achieve its objectives or goals   in the opinion of the company’s management the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements contain all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein these financial statements are condensed and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for complete financial statements these condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the companys december

operations for a full year   the company had no revenues and incurred a net loss of  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively in addition the company has a working capital deficiency and stockholders deficiency of  at march   these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be generated during the next year or thereafter from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources the lack of additional capital could force the company to curtail or cease operations and would therefore have a material adverse effect on its business furthermore there can be no assurance that any such required funds if available will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the companys existing stockholders   the company is attempting to address its lack of liquidity by raising additional funds either in the form of debt or equity or some combination thereof there can be no assurances that the company will be able to raise the additional funds it requires   the accompanying condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of assetcarrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern        table of contents   watchtower inc notes to unaudited condensed financial statements   note   loan

a preference payment in the event of any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the company before any payment is made to the holders of the common stock furthermore the board of directors could

this form q references to watchtower the company we our or us refer to watchtower inc unless the context otherwise indicates   forwardlooking statements   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements which are included elsewhere in this form q the report this report contains forwardlooking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance in some cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as may should expects plans anticipates believes estimates predicts potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industrys actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements   for a description of these risks and uncertainties refer to our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on march   while these forwardlooking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business actual results will almost always vary sometimes materially from any estimates predictions projections assumptions or other future performance suggested herein except as required by applicable law including the securities laws of the united states we do not intend to update any of the forwardlooking statements to conform these statements to actual results   history   watchtower inc was incorporated on february   in the state of nevada the company was focused on becoming involved in the growing market for renewable and environmentally sustainable energy and intended to market and resell agricultural based biodiesel fuels our goal was to source various available agribiodiesel fuel products from many producers internationally and offer renewable alternatives to petroleum based fuels in the united states due to the state of the economy the company has conducted virtually no business other than organizational matters filing its registration statement on form sb which was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission the sec on august   the registration statement and filings of periodic reports with the sec the company has since abandoned its business plan and is now seeking an operating company with which to merge or to acquire   we are now considered a blank check company the us securities and exchange commission the sec defines those companies as any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section  a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies under sec rule b under the securities act of  as amended the securities act we also qualify as a shell company because we have no or nominal assets other than cash and no or nominal operations many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination we intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as we are subject to those requirements   our current business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into our company in certain instances a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of ours or may wish to contribute or sell assets to us rather than to merge no assurances can be given that we will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company we seek to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting or public company whose securities are qualified for trading in the united states secondary markets   a business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of our issued and outstanding common stock and the substitution by the target company of its own management and board of directors no assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into a business combination or if we do enter into such a business combination no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination or as to the nature of the target company        table of contents   plan of operation   general   during the next  months the company intends to seek investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire an interest in one or more business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of a publicly held corporation at this time the company has no plan proposal agreement understanding or arrangement to acquire or merge with any specific business or company and the company has not identified any specific business or company for investigation and evaluation no member of management or promoter of the company has had any material discussions with any other company with respect to any acquisition of that company   the company will not restrict its search to any specific business industry or geographical location and the company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature the discussion of the proposed plan of operation under this caption and throughout this quarterly report is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of the companys virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities   sources of opportunities   the company anticipates that business opportunities for possible acquisition will be referred by various sources including its officers and directors professional advisors securities brokerdealers venture capitalists members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals   the company will seek a potential business opportunity from all known sources but will rely principally on personal contacts of its officers and directors as well as indirect associations between them and other business and professional people it is not presently anticipated that the company will engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations   the officers and directors of the company are currently employed in other positions and will devote only a portion of their time not more than three hours per week to the business affairs of the company until such time as an acquisition has been determined to be highly favorable at which time they expect to spend full time in investigating and closing any acquisition for a period of two weeks in addition in the face of competing demands for their time the officers and directors may grant priority to their fulltime positions rather than to the company   evaluation of opportunities   the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the company management intends to concentrate on identifying prospective business opportunities which may be brought to its attention through present associations with management in analyzing prospective business opportunities management will consider such matters as the available technical financial and managerial resources working capital and other financial requirements history of operation if any prospects for the future present and expected competition the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that management the potential for further research development or exploration specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the company the potential for growth or expansion the potential for profit the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products services or trades name identification and other relevant factors officers and directors of the company will meet personally with management and key personnel of the firm sponsoring the business opportunity as part of their investigation to the extent possible the company intends to utilize written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors the company will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained        table of contents   acquisition of opportunities   in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition the company may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture franchise or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity it may also purchase stock or assets of an existing business on the consummation of a transaction it is possible that the present management and shareholders of the company will not be in control of the company in addition a majority or all of the companys officers and directors may as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction resign and be replaced by new officers and directors without a vote of the companys shareholders   it is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance on exemptions from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws in some circumstances however as a negotiated element of this transaction the company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated under certain conditions or at a specified time thereafter the issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the companys common stock may have a depressive effect on such market while the actual terms of a transaction to which the company may be a party cannot be predicted it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition in a so called tax free reorganization under sections a or  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code in order to obtain tax free treatment under the code it may be necessary for the owners of the acquired business to own  or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity in such event the shareholders of the company would retain less than  of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity which could result in significant dilution in the equity of such shareholders   as part of the companys investigation officers and directors of the company will meet personally with management and key personnel may visit and inspect material facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided check references of management and key personnel and take other reasonable investigative measures to the extent of the companys limited financial resources and management expertise   the manner in which the company participates in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity the respective needs and desires of the company and other parties the management of the opportunity and the relative negotiating strength of the company and such other management   with respect to any mergers or acquisitions negotiations with target company management will be expected to focus on the percentage of the company which target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings in the target company depending upon among other things the target companys assets and liabilities the companys shareholders will in all likelihood hold a lesser percentage ownership interest in the company following any merger or acquisition the percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event the company acquires a target company with substantial assets any merger or acquisition effected by the company can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by the companys shareholders   the company will not have sufficient funds unless it is able to raise funds in a private placement to undertake any operations   accordingly the company will in all likelihood be required to either seek debt or equity financing or obtain funding from third parties in exchange for which the company would probably be required to give up a substantial portion of its interest in any acquired product there is no assurance that the company will be able either to obtain additional financing or interest third parties in providing funding for the further development marketing and manufacturing of any products acquired   it is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others if a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity the costs incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable        table of contents   furthermore even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the company of the related costs incurred   management believes that the company may be able to benefit from the use of leverage in the acquisition of a business opportunity leveraging a transaction involves the acquisition of a business through incurring significant indebtedness for a large percentage of the purchase price for that business   through a leveraged transaction the company would be required to use less of its available funds for acquiring the business opportunity and therefore could commit those funds to the operations of the business opportunity to acquisition of other business opportunities or to other activities the borrowing involved in a leveraged transaction would ordinarily be secured by the assets of the business opportunity to be acquired if the business opportunity acquired is not able to generate sufficient revenues to make payments on the debt incurred by the company to acquire that business opportunity the lender would be able to exercise the remedies provided by law or by contract these leveraging techniques while reducing the amount of funds that the company must commit to acquiring a business opportunity may correspondingly increase the risk of loss to the company no assurance can be given as to the terms or the availability of financing for any acquisition by the company during periods when interest rates are relatively high the benefits of leveraging are not as great as during periods of lower interest rates because the investment in the business opportunity held on a leveraged basis will only be profitable if it generates sufficient revenues to cover the related debt and other costs of the financing lenders from which the company may obtain funds for purposes of a leveraged buyout may impose restrictions on the future borrowing distribution and operating policies of the company it is not possible at this time to predict the restrictions if any which lenders may impose or the impact thereof on the company   results of operations   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed

time management intends to continue in business and has no intention to liquidate the company we have considered various business alternatives including the possible acquisition of an existing business but to date have found possible opportunities unsuitable or excessively priced we do not contemplate limiting the scope of our search to any particular industry management has considered the risk of possible opportunities as well as their potential rewards management has invested time evaluating several proposals for possible acquisition or combination however none of these opportunities were pursued we presently own no real property and at this time have no intention of acquiring any such property our primary expected expenses are comprised substantially of professional fees primarily incident to our reporting requirements   we may have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party there can be no assurance that additional capital will
