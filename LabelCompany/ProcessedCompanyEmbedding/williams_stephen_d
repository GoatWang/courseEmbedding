this product platinum stephen williams plays the organ of st johns luthean church allentown pennsylvania  oar  stephen williams plays the rank reuter pipe organ built in  at st johns lutheran church allentown pennsylvania where ernest m skinner  son organ company built in  the original instrument from which many ranks are incorporated added before the reuter work of  and retained is an almost unique horizontal reed installed at the ceiling high above the chancel the beloved organ enjoys excellent acoustics earlier the skinner organ had been rebuilt by the lehigh organ company of macungie pennsylvania j s bach toccata and fugue in d minor bwv  j s bach wake awake for night is flying bwv  j s bach jesu joy of mans desiring bwv  felix mendelssohn sonata no  in d minor percy whitlock fanfare antonio soler the emperors fanfare césar franck choral no  in b minor petr eben moto ostinato from sunday music leo sowerby carillon louis vierne carillon de westminster platinum in november of  st johns lutheran church and the surrounding areas of downtown allentown pennsylvania were buzzing with a rare kind of excitement that comes around maybe once in a lifetime for communities and church members if theyre fortunate it was this program they were looking forward to  the dedicatory recital celebrating the newly refurbished organ the house was jammed with people eagerly waiting to hear what had been done to their organ in  when the building was completed a new organ built by ernest m skinner from methuen massachusetts was installed skinner known as one of the finest and most innovative builders of the time built an organ that boasted a unique orchestral sound with large diapasons color reeds signature strings and flutes that created a beautiful thick luscious cathedral effect  in  mechanical difficulties left the organ struggling to make those sounds noticeably suffering from a deterioration of mechanisms that included leather parts electrical wiring and many switches and controls the eye never sees the organ committee with an eclectic representation of background age organ experience and opinion was asked to decide whether to restore the instrument rebuild it using as much of the old pipework as possible or ditch the whole idea of pipes and seek alternatives after consulting with a list of professionals in the repairrestoration arena representatives from the reuter organ company in lawrence kansas were sensitive to and sensible about this instrument they were always very clear and intentional about building an instrument that included repurposing the best of old pipework into a scheme that would embrace our needs for the future today hosts of worshipers brides mourners choirs soloists instrumentalists and those who admire this organ as a concert instrument are thrilled time and again by its variety and flexibility of sounds its powerful and yet gentle presence and its uncannily perfect fit in the environment although a challenging decision in many ways we praise and laud those in decision making roles for their resolve to retain and maintain a musical instrument of true integrity and excellence in entering the third decade of enjoying the benefits of a decision well made in  we believe now more than ever that future generations deserve to possess the best tools available to carry on the goals that center around the work of our faith and ministry and the organ is most certainly one of those tools on a personal note i would like to say that it is an enormous privilege to play this instrument on almost a daily basis the sounds of this organ have time and again brought a sense of balance and perspective to my thinking and transported and challenged me to outer and otherwise unrealized realms of beauty and musicmaking for that i am forever grateful stephen williams   the music the program begins with j s bachs toccata and fugue in d minor one of the most immediately identifiable pieces written for the organ it showcases the principal choruses and full ensemble sounds of all the divisions  even the antiphonal organ located in the balcony nearly a half block away from the main case is employed for secondary and echo effects  the two bach chorale preludes that follow feature solo reed stops the setting of the advent hymn wake awake for night is flying uses alternating trumpets from the swell and antiphonal divisions and at the end combines the two reeds the wellknown organ transcription of jesu joy of mans desiring from cantata  uses string sounds with mutation stops from the gemshorn row of the choir division to accompany the chorale tune on two of e m skinners signature reeds the french horn and the english horn felix mendelssohns sixth sonata from op  is in the form of a theme and variations based on the chorale vater unser im himmelreich our father god in heaven above  the opening theme or chorale is presented on the organs abundant  and  flue stops  a sound that fills the room with both warmth and reassuring strength the variations provide great opportunities for exploration of flute ensembles and color reeds the final variation demonstrates a germanic plenum toccata treatment in the manuals superimposed over the melody on a strong pedal reed as the variation progresses more principal and reed stops are added to create a full complement by the end of the movement the fugue that follows continues to explore larger ensembles finally developing into a dialogue between the heroic festival trumpet in the ceiling and the commanding tuba enclosed in the choir the final movement is one of the most beautiful examples of the lyric mendelssohn inspiring the use of gentle foundations and rich organ string tone the next two selections feature the organs two major trumpet stops first english composer percy whitlocks fanfare uses the reuter tuba voiced on  of wind to full advantage the works calmer quieter middle section features the choir clarinet strings and swell vox humana the bookend sections of antonio solers emperors fanfare are played almost entirely on what has been dubbed the party horn in the sky horizontal trumpets mounted in the ceiling nearly eighty feet above the floor at the entrance to the chancel we are still trying to figure out whose crazy idea it was to install these pipes in the ceiling but we are sure glad they did it particularly since it has brought a smile to many brides at their wedding entrance french romantic organ music is often surrounded by a dark and intense mysticism as exemplified by the belgianborn césar francks beautifully crafted choral in b minor the choral here is not a lutheranbased hymn tune as it was for bach and mendelssohn but is an original theme that is set in a chorallike way  it develops as a seamless journey unfolding with drama and gestures that are distinctly orchestral stops of the organ are used to create subtle shadings of light and dark by way of crescendo and decrescendo dame gillian weir refers to this composition as francks best work a giant passacaglia suggesting the tolling of a great bell as it moves from somber genesis through an avalanche of sound to its peaceful end petr eben was a czech composer whose music remains delightfully challenging for both performer and listener moto ostinato is the fascinating third piece from a suite entitled sonntagsmusik sunday music even though it is unlikely to be heard at most church services in an ongoing drama of good versus evil this movement is based on the passage in the gospel of mark  my name is legion for we are many eben uses a militaristic rhythmic ostinato to advance the music in volume and intensity until it seems the ranks of organ pipes will literally break loose from their orderly moorings at the beginning we hear the great cornet pitted against the great trombone in a quieter section the french horn and highpitched stops from the diminutive gemshorn cornet continue the dialogue  the swell waldhorn and choir clarinet are also paired before the larger ensembles begin to take over in a relentless march to full organ ultimately cap­ped by the festival trumpet the final two works on the program are signature pieces at st johns having been played by musicians past and present for many many occasions carillon by american composer leo sowerby is a delightfully moving and quiet piece it is perfectly at home on the st johns instrument using harp chimes and french horn along with the beautifully singing strings and flutes the discerning ear will detect in this recording a slight tuning inconsistency and a bit of extra action noise when the harpcelesta is heard the harp is a bona fide component installed with the e m skinner  son organ in  perhaps it existed in the organ built as op  in  by skinners previous firm the skinner organ company of boston for a new york city church and acquired by skinner when that church replaced it in  with a new austin organ the harp has been a lovely and useful stop for many years but now suffers mechanical difficulties when we were recording this cd the harp was having a particularly difficult time of it but we decided to use it in honor of its long years of faithful service instead of using the electronic harp added in  to join four other digital stops which had been installed in  as noted in the stoplist in this booklet louis viernes carillon de westminster from his  pičces de fantaisie op  no  is based on the chimes of the clock tower now called the elizabeth tower in honor of queen elizabeth ii on the north side of the palace of westminster in london also nicknamed big ben after the name of the largest  tons of the towers four bells vierne dedicated this piece to his friend noted english organ builder henry willis who as legend has it hummed the tune to vierne although slightly incorrectly the truth will never be known but it is also very likely vierne altered the tune to suit his own designs nevertheless it is a magnificent piece in every way and a splendid way to end the celebration of this grand organ   stephen williams stephen williams is director of music and organist at st
