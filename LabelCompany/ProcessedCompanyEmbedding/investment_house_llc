forming an llc for real estate investments pros  cons by jeff weaver esq attorney forming an llc for real estate investments pros  cons by jeff weaver esq january  over the last decade limited liability companies llcs have become one of the most preferred forms of business entities through which to hold title to investment real estate properties llcs did not come into existence in the united states until  when the state of wyoming enacted special legislation to accommodate the needs of oil companies prior to llcs real estate investors seeking limited liability protection were largely limited to using corporations to acquire title—a form of entity that has potential drawbacks florida followed wyomings lead a few years later by enacting its own llc statute in  and now all  states have enacted legislation creating some form of the llc business structure the insulation from personal risk exposure for real estate investors provided by llcs coupled with the relative ease of administration and potential tax benefits make ownership of investment property through an llc a very desirable option in most instances llc vs liability insurance although there are many benefits to holding real property assets through an llc a limited liability company may not be the best holding vehicle for every property owner for many real estate investors the trouble of forming and maintaining a company isnt worth protection from the theoretical threat of a lawsuit particularly when affordable liability insurance is available that said real estate investors that rely solely on insurance as a means of protection from personal liability take a significant risk liability policies typically have limits exceptions and carveouts while the chance of a loss that exceeds policy limits may be remote if it happens the consequences can be devastating under current laws and market trends the popularity of real estate holding llcs is very likely to continue to increase as more and more property owners seek to take advantage of the benefits offered by this form of entity llcs limit personal liability first and foremost llcs limit personal vulnerability to potential lawsuits related to the property consider the situation in which the owner of an investment property leases it to a tenant who decides to throw a big party during which one of the tenants guests falls over a balcony in todays legal climate it is quite possible that the injured guest would pursue a claim based on the “unsafe condition” of the rental dwelling more often than not the owner would be named in any lawsuit resulting from the incident ready to form an llc legalzoom can help get started now if that rental property were owned by a real estate investor individually he or she would be named in the lawsuit and would have to defend his or her personal assets from the plaintiffs claims in contrast if that property were owned by an llc the owners risk exposure would be insulated by the protection of the company leaving only the assets owned by the llc as opposed to all of the owners personal assets exposed to potential lawsuits passthrough taxation for single  multimember llcs another advantage of an llc is the owners ability to enjoy the benefits of passthrough taxation in  the irs released revenue ruling  which declared that wyoming llcs would be taxed as partnerships even though they provide for corporatelike protection against liability c corporations in contrast are subject to double taxation—once at the corporate level and again when dividends are distributed to shareholders while the owners of corporations can achieve passthrough taxation by making an “s” election s corporations are subject to many other restrictions and requirements that limit their utility in the real estate investment realm the  revenue ruling was a true gamechanger because it enabled real estate investors to avoid double taxation by acquiring property through an llc while enjoying a liability shield under the default tax classification rules the irs classifies a real estate holding company with one owner as they would a sole proprietorship namely as a “disregarded entity” as a result income and capital gains from the llc pass through directly to the owner who would only have to pay taxes as an individual while still enjoying the protections offered by the llc liability shield since there is no separate llc tax the owner can avoid double taxation on both the rental income generated by the property and the appreciation in value of the property upon disposition moreover the owner of a singlemember llc can deduct mortgage interest similar to a sole proprietor based on current irs rules real estate holding companies that have several owners are known as “multimember” llcs and are generally taxed by the irs like partnerships meaning that the llc files an “informational” tax return but does not actually pay taxes itself multimember llcs also enjoy the benefits of passthrough taxation as the llc passes its profits and losses through to its members who report their portion of the llcs business income or losses on either a schedule c k or form  with their individual income tax returns this means that both single member and multimember llcs offer the benefits of passthrough taxation of profits and losses and limited liability and personal protection for the owners llcs can make business life easier llcs offer numerous other general benefits relative to other entity forms that arent necessarily unique to—but certainly apply to—the use of llcs to hold real estate investments when delegating management responsibilities llcs enjoy much greater flexibility than either a corporation or partnership while corporations are statutorily required to have officers and directors the llc can be easily managed by its owners or thirdparty managers in the many states that impose increased fees based on the authorized number of shares llcs may pay lower state registration and maintenance fees than corporations owners of llcs can take advantage of the tremendous flexibility in the distribution of profits as determined by the llcs operating agreement cash flow distributions do not have to be pro rata according to ownership like an s corporation which gives the owners the ability to financially reward the “sweat equity” effort of select members through appropriate distributions of available cash flow unlike an s corporation foreign ownership and investment in us real estate is possible through an llc llc owners can also easily transfer their ownership in real estate holdings by proactively gifting the companys membership interests to their heirs each year over time it is entirely possible to effectively pass ownership of real estate owned by an llc to loved ones without ever having to formally execute and record a new deed this enables property owners to avoid transfer and recording taxes and fees which can be substantial in many states although not every company will seek these particular benefits its safe to say that llcs can offer steep rewards to companies that choose to take advantage of them explore your options many business owners choose to form an llc because they are unfamiliar with the many legal nuances between different entity choices and they simply assume that an llc offers the most protection from risk because it has “limited liability” in its name in reality a properly formed and operated llc does indeed limit the personal liability of the owners as much as us law allows by affording the owners no personal risk above and beyond their investment in the company—but in many instances so do corporations and certain partnerships of course if a small business owner of any entity form fails to respect the separate and distinct identity of the business or observe statutorily required corporate formalities such as comingling personal and business funds paying owners instead of creditors or failing to maintain a registered agent the integrity of the corporate shield provided by law will be compromised and potentially expose the owners to personal liability generally speaking though the basic requirements to operate an llc within the confines of the corporate statutes are not particularly onerous minimize risks with the right strategy there is simply no way to eliminate all the risks associated with starting a real estate investment business but you can easily improve your chances of success by complying with the corporate formalities required by applicable laws even though these steps may seem tedious and somewhat confusing if you are in the market for investment real estate you should at least consider whether or not the acquisition through an llc is the right choice for you if so it is much easier to purchase the property through the llc to begin with as opposed to trying to transfer the real estate to an entity at a later date where a lender might have to consent to the transaction an llc may not offer any more or less protection from outside lawsuits than a properly formed and operated corporation or limited liability partnership but it does offer many other advantages that make it the most desirable form of entity in many cases particularly with respect to real estate holding companies if youre considering forming an llc for

stockswhy do companies issue stockwhat kinds of stock are therewhat are the benefits and risks of stockshow to buy and sell stocksunderstanding feesavoiding fraudadditional information why do people buy stocks investors buy stocks for various reasons here are some of them capital appreciation which occurs when a stock rises in price dividend payments which come when the company distributes some of its earnings to stockholders ability to vote shares and influence the company why do companies issue stock companies issue stock to get money for various things which may include paying off debt launching new products expanding into new markets or regions enlarging facilities or building new ones what kinds of stocks are there there are two main kinds of stocks common stock and preferred stock common stock entitles owners to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends preferred stockholders usually don’t have voting rights but they receive dividend payments before common stockholders do and have priority over common stockholders if the company goes bankrupt and its assets are liquidated common and preferred stocks may fall into one or more of the following categories growth stocks have earnings growing at a faster rate than the market average they rarely pay dividends and investors buy them in the hope of capital appreciation a startup technology company is likely to be a growth stock income stocks pay dividends consistently investors buy them for the income they generate an established utility company is likely to be an income stock value stocks have a low pricetoearnings pe ratio meaning they are cheaper to buy than stocks with a higher pe value stocks may be growth or income stocks and their low pe ratio may reflect the fact that they have fallen out of favor with investors for some reason people buy value stocks in the hope that the market has overreacted and that the stock’s price will rebound bluechip stocks are shares in large wellknown companies with a solid history of growth they generally pay dividends another way to categorize stocks is by the size of the company as shown in its market capitalization there are largecap midcap and smallcap stocks shares in very small companies are sometimes called “microcap” stocks the very lowest priced stocks are known as “penny stocks” these companies may have little or no earnings penny stocks do not pay dividends and are highly speculative what are the benefits and risks of stocks stocks offer investors the greatest potential for growth capital appreciation over the long haul investors willing to stick with stocks over long periods of time say  years generally have been rewarded with strong positive returns but stock prices move down as well as up there’s no guarantee that the company whose stock you hold will grow and do well so you can lose money you invest in stocks if a company goes bankrupt and its assets are liquidated common stockholders are the last in line to share in the proceeds the company’s bondholders will be paid first then holders of preferred stock if you are a common stockholder you get whatever is left which may be nothing even when companies aren’t in danger of failing their stock price may fluctuate up or down large company stocks as a group for example have lost money on average about one out of every three years if you have to sell shares on a day when the stock price is below the price you paid for the shares you will lose money on the sale market fluctuations can be unnerving to some investors a stock’s price can be affected by factors inside the company such as a faulty product or by events the company has no control over such as political or market events stocks usually are one part of an investor’s holdings if you are young and saving for a longterm goal such as retirement you may want to hold more stocks than bonds investors nearing or in retirement may want to hold more bonds than stocks the risks of stock holdings can be offset in part by investing in a number of different stocks investing in other kinds of assets that are not stocks such as bonds is another way to offset some of the risks of owning stocks how to buy and sell stocks you can buy and sell stocks through a direct stock plan a dividend reinvestment plan a discount or fullservice broker a stock fund direct stock plans some companies allow you to buy or sell their stock directly through them without using a broker this saves on commissions but you may have to pay other fees to the plan including if you transfer shares to a broker to sell them some companies limit direct stock plans to employees of the company or existing shareholders some require minimum amounts for purchases or account levels direct stock plans usually will not allow you to buy or sell shares at a specific market price or at a specific time instead the company will buy or sell shares for the plan at set times — such as daily weekly or monthly — and at an average market price depending on the plan you may be able to automate your purchases and have the cost deducted automatically from your savings account dividend reinvestment plans these plans allow you to buy more shares of a stock you already own by reinvesting dividend payments into the company you must sign an agreement with the company to have this done check with the company or your brokerage firm to see if you will be charged for this service discount or fullservice broker brokers buy and sell shares for customers for a fee known as a commission stock funds are another way to buy stocks these are a type of mutual fund that invests primarily in stocks depending on its investment objective and policies a stock fund may concentrate on a particular type of stock such as blue chips largecap value stocks or midcap growth stocks stock funds are offered by investment companies and can be purchased directly from them or through a broker or adviser understanding fees buying and selling stocks entails fees a direct stock plan or a dividend reinvestment plan may charge you a fee for that service brokers who buy and sell stocks for you charge a commission a discount brokerage charges lower commissions than what you would pay at a fullservice brokerage but generally you have to research and choose investments by yourself a fullservice brokerage costs more but the higher commissions pay for investment advice based on that firm’s research avoiding fraud stocks in public companies are registered with the sec and in most cases public companies are required to file

shortterm debt the combined holdings of the mutual fund are known as its portfolio investors buy shares in mutual funds each share represents an investor’s part ownership in the fund and the income it generates why do people buy mutual fundswhat types of mutual funds are therewhat are the benefits and risks of mutual fundshow to buy and sell mutual fundsunderstanding feesavoiding fraudadditional information why do people buy mutual funds mutual funds are a popular choice among investors because they generally offer the following features professional management the fund managers do the research for you they select the securities and monitor the performance diversification or “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” mutual funds typically invest in a range of companies and industries this helps to lower your risk if one company fails affordability most mutual funds set a relatively low dollar amount for initial investment and subsequent purchases liquidity mutual fund investors can easily redeem their shares at any time for the current net asset value nav plus any redemption fees what types of mutual funds are there most mutual funds fall into one of four main categories – money market funds bond funds stock funds and target date funds each type has different features risks and rewards money market funds have relatively low risks by law they can invest only in certain highquality shortterm investments issued by us corporations and federal state and local governments bond funds have higher risks than money market funds because they typically aim to produce higher returns because there are many different types of bonds the risks and rewards of bond funds can vary dramatically stock funds invest in corporate stocks not all stock funds are the same some examples are growth funds focus on stocks that may not pay a regular dividend but have potential for aboveaverage financial gains income funds invest in stocks that pay regular dividends index funds track a particular market index such as the standard  poor’s  index sector funds specialize in a particular industry segment target date funds hold a mix of stocks bonds and other investments over time the mix gradually shifts according to the fund’s strategy target date funds sometimes known as lifecycle funds are designed for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind what are the benefits and risks of mutual funds mutual funds offer professional investment management and potential diversification they also offer three ways to earn money dividend payments a fund may earn income from dividends on stock or interest on bonds the fund then pays the shareholders nearly all the income less expenses capital gains distributions the price of the securities in a fund may increase when a fund sells a security that has increased in price the fund has a capital gain at the end of the year the fund distributes these capital gains minus any capital losses to investors increased nav if the market value of a fund’s portfolio increases after deducting expenses then the value of the fund and its shares increases the higher nav reflects the higher value of your investment all funds carry some level of risk with mutual funds you may lose some or all of the money you invest because the securities held by a fund can go down in value dividends or interest payments may also change as market conditions change a fund’s past performance is not as important as you might think because past performance does not predict future returns but past performance can tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been over a period of time the more volatile the fund the higher the investment risk how to buy and sell mutual funds investors buy mutual fund shares from the fund itself or through a broker for the fund rather than from other investors the price that investors pay for the mutual fund is the fund’s per share net asset value plus any fees charged at the time of purchase such as sales loads mutual fund shares are “redeemable” meaning investors can sell the shares back to the fund at any time the fund usually must send you the payment within seven days before buying shares in a mutual fund read the prospectus carefully the prospectus contains information about the mutual fund’s investment objectives risks performance and expenses see how to read a mutual fund prospectus part  part  and part  to learn more about key information in a prospectus understanding fees as with any business running a mutual fund involves costs funds pass along these costs to investors by charging fees and expenses fees and expenses vary from fund to fund a fund with high costs must perform better than a lowcost fund to generate the same returns for you even small differences in fees

real estate investment trusts reits what are reits real estate investment trusts “reits” allow individuals to invest in largescale incomeproducing real estate a reit is a company that owns and typically operates incomeproducing real estate or related assets these may include office buildings shopping malls apartments hotels resorts selfstorage facilities warehouses and mortgages or loans unlike other real estate companies a reit does not develop real estate properties to resell them instead a reit buys and develops properties primarily to operate them as part of its own investment portfolio why would somebody invest in reits reits provide a way for individual investors to earn a share of the income produced through commercial real estate ownership – without actually having to go out and buy commercial real estate what types of reits are there many reits are registered with the sec and are publicly traded on a stock exchange these are known as publicly traded reits others may be registered with the sec but are not publicly traded these are known as non traded reits also known as nonexchange traded reits this is one of the most important distinctions among the various kinds of reits before investing in a reit you should understand whether or not it is publicly traded and how this could affect the benefits and risks to you what are the benefits and risks of reits reits offer a way to include real estate in one’s investment portfolio additionally some reits may offer higher dividend yields than some other investments but there are some risks especially with nonexchange traded reits because they do not trade on a stock exchange nontraded reits involve special risks lack of liquidity nontraded reits are illiquid investments they generally cannot be sold readily on the open market if you need to sell an asset to raise money quickly you may not be able to do so with shares of a nontraded reit share value transparency while the market price of a publicly traded reit is readily accessible it can be difficult to determine the value of a share of a nontraded reit nontraded reits typically do not provide an estimate of their value per share until  months after their offering closes this may be years after you have made your investment as a result for a significant time period you may be unable to assess the value of your nontraded reit investment and its volatility distributions may be paid from offering proceeds and borrowings investors may be attracted to nontraded reits by their relatively high dividend yields compared to those of publicly traded reits unlike publicly traded reits however nontraded reits frequently pay distributions in excess of their funds from operations to do so they may use offering proceeds and borrowings this practice which is typically not used by publicly traded reits reduces the value of the shares and the cash available to the company to purchase additional assets conflicts of interest nontraded reits typically have an external manager instead of their own employees this can lead to potential conflicts of interests with shareholders for example the reit may pay the external manager significant fees based on the amount of property acquisitions and assets under management these fee incentives may not necessarily align with the interests of shareholders how to buy and sell reits you can invest in a publicly traded reit which is listed on a major stock exchange by purchasing shares through a broker you can purchase shares of a nontraded reit through a broker that participates in the nontraded reit’s offering you can also purchase shares in a reit mutual fund or reit exchangetraded fund understanding fees and taxes publicly traded reits can be purchased through a broker generally you can purchase the common stock preferred stock or debt security of a publicly traded reit brokerage fees will apply nontraded reits are typically sold by a broker or financial adviser nontraded reits generally have high upfront fees sales commissions and upfront offering fees usually total approximately  to  percent of the investment these costs lower the value of the investment by a significant amount special tax considerations most reits pay out at least  percent of their taxable income to their shareholders the shareholders of a reit are responsible for paying taxes on the dividends and any capital gains they receive in connection with their investment in the reit dividends paid by reits generally are treated as ordinary income and are not entitled to the reduced tax rates on other types of corporate dividends consider consulting your tax adviser before investing in reits avoiding fraud be wary of any person who attempts to sell reits that are not registered with the sec you can verify the registration of both publicly traded and nontraded reits through the sec’s edgar system you can also use edgar to review a reit’s annual and quarterly reports as well as any offering prospectus for more on how to use edgar please visit research public companies you should also check out the broker or investment adviser who recommends purchasing a reit to learn how to do so please visit working with brokers and investment advisers additional information sec investor bulletin real estate investment trusts reits finra investor alert public nontraded reits  perform a

between you and an insurance company that requires the insurer to make payments to you either immediately or in the future you buy an annuity by making either a single payment or a series of payments similarly your payout may come either as one lumpsum payment or as a series of payments over time why do people buy annuitieswhat kinds of annuities are therewhat are the benefits and risks of variable annuitieshow to buy and sell annuitiesunderstanding feesavoiding fraudadditional information why do people buy annuities people typically buy annuities to help manage their income in retirement annuities provide three things periodic payments for a specific amount of time this may be for the rest of your life or the life of your spouse or another person death benefits if you die before you start receiving payments the person you name as your beneficiary receives a specific payment taxdeferred growth you pay no taxes on the income and investment gains from your annuity until you withdraw the money what kinds of annuities are there there are three basic types of annuities fixed variable and indexed here is how they work fixed annuity the insurance company promises you a minimum rate of interest and a fixed amount of periodic payments fixed annuities are regulated by state insurance commissioners please check with your state insurance commission about the risks and benefits of fixed annuities and to confirm that your insurance broker is registered to sell insurance in your state variable annuity the insurance company allows you to direct your annuity payments to different investment options usually mutual funds your payout will vary depending on how much you put in the rate of return on your investments and expenses the sec regulates variable annuities indexed annuity this annuity combines features of securities and insurance products the insurance company credits you with a return that is based on a stock market index such as the standard  poor’s  index indexed annuities are regulated by state insurance commissioners what are the benefits and risks of variable annuities some people look to annuities to “insure” their retirement and to receive periodic payments once they no longer receive a salary there are two phases to annuities the accumulation phase and the payout phase during the accumulation phase you make payments that may be split among various investment options in addition variable annuities often allow you to put some of your money in an account that pays a fixed rate of interest during the payout phase you get your payments back along with any investment income and gains you may take the payout in one lumpsum payment or you may choose to receive a regular stream of payments generally monthly all investments carry a level of risk make sure you consider the financial strength of the insurance company issuing the annuity you want to be sure the company will still be around and financially sound during your payout phase variable annuities have a number of features that you need to understand before you invest understand that variable annuities are designed as an investment for longterm goals such as retirement they are not suitable for shortterm goals because you typically will pay substantial taxes and charges or other penalties if you withdraw your money early variable annuities also involve investment risks just as mutual funds do how to buy and sell annuities insurance companies sell annuities as do some banks brokerage firms and mutual fund companies make sure you read and understand your annuity contract all fees should be clearly stated in the contract your most important source of information about investment options within a variable annuity is the mutual fund prospectus request prospectuses for all the mutual fund options you might want to select read the prospectuses carefully before you decide how to allocate your purchase payments among the investment options realize that if you are investing in a variable annuity through a taxadvantaged retirement plan such as a k plan or an individual retirement account you will get no additional tax advantages from a variable annuity in such cases consider buying a variable annuity only if it makes sense because of the annuity’s other features note that if you sell or withdraw money from a variable annuity too soon after your purchase the insurance company will impose a “surrender charge” this is a type of sales charge that applies in the surrender period typically six to eight years after you buy the annuity surrender charges will reduce the value of  and the return on  your investment understanding fees you will pay several charges when you invest in a variable annuity be sure you understand all charges before you invest besides surrender charges there are a number of other charges including mortality and expense risk charge this charge is equal to a certain percentage of your account value typically about  per year this charge pays the issuer for the insurance risk it assumes under the annuity contract the profit from this charge sometimes is used to pay a commission to the person who sold you the annuity administrative fees the issuer may charge you for record keeping and other administrative expenses this may be a flat annual fee or a percentage of your account value underlying fund expenses in addition to fees charged by the issuer you will pay the fees and expenses for underlying mutual fund investments fees and charges for other features additional fees typically apply for special features such as a guaranteed minimum income benefit or longterm care insurance initial sales loads fees for transferring part of your account from one investment option to another and other fees also may apply penalties if you withdraw money from an annuity before you are age  ½ you may have to pay a  tax penalty to the internal revenue service on top of any taxes you owe on the income avoiding fraud variable annuities are considered to be securities all brokerdealers and investment advisers that sell variable annuities must be registered before buying an annuity from a broker or adviser confirm that they are registered using brokercheck in most cases the investments offered within a variable annuity are mutual funds by law each mutual fund is required to file a prospectus and
