shrum today’s healthcare delivery system is facing numerous challenges how do we deliver care effectively at a significantly lower cost while increasing access improving outcomes and enhancing the patient experience at osu center of health sciences we believe that the only way to tackle these complex challenges is through innovation and technologyas tulsa’s only academic health center and oklahoma’s leader in the training of healthcare providers for rural and underserved oklahoma we are exploring developing testing and implementing creative approaches to delivering quality care to oklahomans no matter where they live we are examining the efficiency of the traditional model of healthcare delivery and asking “can we bring the care to the patient instead of having the patient come to the provider” we see an enormous opportunity to unleash the power of technology to move the delivery of care much closer to the patient’s communitiesmany of us in tulsa take for granted the ease and convenience of accessing health care we make an appointment take time off work and then drive a short distance to our doctor’s office rural oklahomans and underserved tulsans have a vastly different experience accessing health care they face reliable transportation hurdles and often experience financial setbacks in seeking medical treatmentaccessing health care is particularly challenging for rural oklahomans many small towns do not have a primary care physician much less a specialist physician rural oklahomans often have to travel long distances to receive any type of medical treatment primary or specialty care imagine having to drive  to  miles to see a primary care physician and having to drive even farther to see a specialist imagine having to request an uncompensated sick day from your employer to see a doctor the inconvenience and expense associated with accessing care may result in underserved tulsans and rural oklahomans delaying or foregoing care until the situation becomes dire and necessitates a costly visit to the emergency room or an exorbitant transport to an urban medical centerthere is a real need for innovation in healthcare delivery to address challenges with healthcare access quality and affordability for underserved tulsans and rural oklahomans at osuchs we are committed to leveraging our intellectual capital creative energy statewide infrastructure and technological assets to bringing quality care to oklahomans regardless of where they live through a partnership with dr sanjeev arora founder and director of the echo institute at the university of new mexico school of medicine osuchs has launched the osuchs project echo osuchs project echo is proud to offer service lines in the areas of psychiatry addiction medicine obesity medicine hivaids and women’s healthproject echo extension for community healthcare outcomes is a collaborative medical education learning and capacity building model developed by dr arora the model uses interactive videoconferencing to link specialist teams with primary care providers in underserved areas through weekly videoconferences primary care providers in underserved areas gain the specialty knowledge and experience to treat their patient’s conditions that used to require a specialist consequently patients gain access to specialty care from a provider they trust at a lower cost without having to leave their community we look forward to the next step in this effort the rural health leadership summit to be held on the osuchs campus and featuring dr sanjeev arora as the keynote speaker by leveraging technologically enabled healthcare delivery models such as project echo osuchs will transform the delivery of health care for the greater good of our state and

readers will most appreciate we have these guidelines for submissions  opeds should to be about public policy issues not personalities  they should be debatable in nature they should take a stance that some but not all of our readers would agree with  they should not be in direct response to previous oped columns syndicated columns letters to the editor or tulsa world editorials the proper forum for such responses is our letter to the editor space  they should come from authors who are authoritative on the topic or offer some unique identifiable perspective  they should to be about  words long  they cannot be election endorsements or unendorsements although at times the editorial department will solicit oped columns on both sides of an election for publication  they cannot be product endorsement  they should come from an author who lives within our circulation area  they should not have been published elsewhere or submitted for publication elsewhere  they cannot be libelous incendiary or offensive to broad portions of our readership  they should to be accompanied with an electronic photo of the author for publication these are not hardandfast rules sometimes typically because of relative light demand for oped space the editorial editor may waive one or more of the guidelines at times of high demand he may not be able to do so columns should be submitted
