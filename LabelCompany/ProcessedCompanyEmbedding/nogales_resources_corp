through additional infusions of equity or debt capital on an asneeded basis although he is under no legal obligation to provide funding this offer is not the subject of a formal written agreement with us and there are no specific limits as to time or dollar amount we currently do not have any firm arrangements for financing in addition to the financing contemplated by this prospectus we may not be able to obtain financing when required obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors including the market prices for minerals and the costs of exploring for or commercial production of this material the mineral exploration industry in general is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered a ready market may not exist for the sale of the reserves most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater resources to engage in the production of mineral claims we were incorporated on april   and our operations are not wellestablished our resources at the present time are limited we may exhaust all of our resources and be unable to complete full exploration of our mineral claim there is also significant competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting mineral exploration activities if a commercially viable deposit is found to exist and we are unable to retain additional qualified personnel we may be unable to enter into production and achieve profitable operations these factors set forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other companies in the industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a commercial viable deposit is found to exist numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any substances discovered these factors include market fluctuations the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment government regulations including regulations relating to prices taxes royalties land tenure land use importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection the exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital company description we are an exploration stage mineral exploration company incorporated in nevada on april   on may   we incorporated a whollyowned subsidiary nrc exploration llc in the state of nevada for the purposes of mineral exploration on may   our consulting geologist introduced us to an attractive mineral property we acquired an option on that property whereupon we can acquire  legal and beneficial ownership interest in the donald mineral claim hereafter the “mineral claim” the mineral claim is located in the ominica mining district located in the central part of the province of british columbia canada it is located on provincial lands administered by the province of british columbia the legal and ownership rights on the claim are limited to the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to applicable regulations the mineral claim totals roughly  acres or  square miles in size and is located approximately  miles northeast of the community of fort st james british columbia the mineral claim comprises a rectangular shaped block of land of approximately  miles long by  miles wide and is located along the pinchi fault zone historic exploration work shows that the claims are located within an area that has potential for copper mineralization our currently planned exploration budget requires the expenditure of  in the initial year of our mineral exploration program plus the expenditure of an additional amount in the second year of our mineral exploration program if recommended by our consulting geologist further exploration activities beyond our currently planned exploration program will be dependent upon a number of factors including our consulting geologist’s recommendations based upon the exploration program results and our available funds in order to prove or disprove the economic viability of our mineral claim our mineral exploration costs plus our operating costs

we may not be able to obtain financing when required obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors including the market prices for minerals and the costs of exploring for or commercial production of this material the mineral exploration industry in general is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered a ready market may not exist for the sale of the reserves most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater resources to engage in the production of mineral claims we were incorporated on april   and our operations are not wellestablished our resources at the present time are limited we may exhaust all of our resources and be unable to complete full exploration of our mineral claim there is also significant competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting mineral exploration activities if a commercially viable deposit is found to exist and we are unable to retain additional qualified personnel we may be unable to enter into production and achieve profitable operations these factors set forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other companies in the industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a commercial viable deposit is found to exist numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any substances discovered these factors include market fluctuations the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment government regulations including regulations relating to prices taxes royalties land tenure land use importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection the exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital company description we are an exploration stage mineral exploration company incorporated in nevada on april   on may   we incorporated a whollyowned subsidiary nrc exploration llc in the state of nevada for the purposes of mineral exploration on may   our consulting geologist introduced us to an attractive mineral property we acquired an option on that property whereupon we can acquire  legal and beneficial ownership interest in the donald mineral claim hereafter the “mineral claim” the mineral claim is located in the ominica mining district located in the central part of the province of british columbia canada it is located on provincial lands administered by the province of british columbia the legal and ownership rights on the claim are limited to the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to applicable regulations the mineral claim totals roughly  acres or  square miles in size and is located approximately  miles northeast of the community of fort st james british columbia the mineral claim comprises a rectangular shaped block of land of approximately  miles long by  miles wide and is located along the pinchi fault zone historic exploration work shows that the claims are located within an area that has potential for copper mineralization our currently planned exploration budget requires the expenditure of  in the initial year of our mineral exploration program plus the expenditure of an additional amount in the second year of our mineral exploration program if recommended by our consulting geologist further exploration activities beyond our currently planned exploration program will be dependent upon a number of factors including our consulting geologist’s recommendations based upon the exploration program results and our available funds in order to prove or disprove the economic viability of our mineral claim our mineral exploration costs plus our operating costs

of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability the fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability not on assumptions specific to the entity in addition the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of nonperformance risk including our own credit risk   in addition to defining fair value the standard expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market   each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety these levels are   level  – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets   level  – inputs are based upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   level  – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the fair values are therefore determined using modelbased techniques that include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques   the carrying value of the company’s financial assets and liabilities which consist of cash prepaid expenses short term loans accounts payable and accrued liabilities and due to related parties in management’s opinion approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments these financial assets and liabilities are valued using level  inputs except for cash which is at level  unless otherwise noted it is management’s opinion that the company is not exposed to significant interest exchange or credit risks arising from these

policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both us gaap and sec guidelines   we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this annual report on form k we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above to remediate such weaknesses we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending april   i appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management and ii adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting the remediation efforts set out in i and ii are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required if we are unsuccessful in securing such funds remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner

general meeting of our shareholders or until they resign or are removed from office in accordance with our bylaws our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board   family relationships   there are no family relationships between or among the directors executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by us to become directors or executive officers   involvement in certain legal proceedings   to the best of our knowledge during the past ten years none of the following occurred with respect to a present or former director executive officer or employee  any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to

committees of the board   until further determination by the board the full board of directors will undertake the duties of the audit committee compensation committee and nominating committee   audit committee   we do not have a separately designated standing audit committee the entire board of directors performs the functions of an audit committee but no written charter governs the actions of the board when performing the functions of what would generally be performed by an audit committee the board approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the independent accountants to discuss issues related to financial reporting in addition the board reviews the scope and results of the audit with the independent accountants reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results considers the adequacy of our internal accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be paid to the independent auditor and the performance of the independent auditor our board of directors which performs the functions of an audit committee does not have a member who would qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” within the definition of item dii of regulation sk we believe that at our current size and stage of development the addition of a special audit committee financial expert to the board is not necessary      table of contents     nomination committee   our board of directors does not maintain a nominating committee as a result no written charter governs the director nomination process our size and the size of our board at this time do not require a separate nominating committee   when evaluating director nominees our directors consider the following factors   the appropriate size of our board of directors our needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our directors the knowledge skills and experience of nominees including experience in finance administration or public service in light of prevailing business conditions and the knowledge skills and experience already possessed by other members of the board experience in political affairs experience with accounting rules and practices and the desire to balance the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new board members   our goal is to assemble a board that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional experience in doing so the board will also consider candidates with appropriate nonbusiness backgrounds   other than the foregoing there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees although the board may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in our best interests as well as our stockholders in addition the board identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the board willing to continue in service current members of the board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for renomination if any member of the board does not wish to continue in service or if the board decides not to renominate a member for reelection the board then identifies the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above current members of the board are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria described above the board may also engage in research to identify qualified individuals to date we have not engaged third parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees although we reserve the right in the future to retain a third party search firm if necessary the board does not typically consider shareholder nominees because it believes that its current nomination process is sufficient to identify directors who serve our best interests   code of ethics   we currently have not adopted
