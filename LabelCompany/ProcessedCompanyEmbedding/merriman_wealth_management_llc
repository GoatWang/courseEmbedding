local newspaper the registerguard ask merriman sipc coverage by chris waclawik  jul    ask merriman chris waclawik wealth protection q brokerage houses have additional insurance that covers certain events relative to my deposit should i be concerned when the funds on deposit at a major brokerage exceed the insurance limits let’s assume this refers to sipc coverage brokerage firms use while loosely similar to the more familiar fdic insurance to cover bank deposits sipc insurance is much more limited in scope essentially sipc insurance provides coverage from loss due to the brokerage firm going out of business it provides up to  of protection on securities and up to  in cash in excess of what is recovered it does not provide coverage from a decline in the value of investments to help visualize an example of when sipc would come into play let’s use an example of a  million client account · assume the brokerage firm fails resulting in  billion of client claims on assets · assume  of clients’ assets  billion are recovered the actual historical recovery rate is  according to sipc · the client in this example holding  million in sipc eligible assets would receive  million from recovered assets and  from sipc the loss to the  million client account would be zero it’s exceedingly rare for a client to be entitled to recover damages under sipc and not be made whole because of the  limit also most large brokerage firms purchase “excess of sipc” insurance which insures clients for any losses above the  limit ultimately clients do not need to be concerned when funds at a brokerage exceed the coverage limits more detailed information about sipc coverage can be found here   do you have a question about investments taxes retirement or insurance send it to “ask merriman” and one of our financial advisors will help you find an answer how to report a backdoor roth ira contribution on your taxes by geoffrey curran  jun    geoff curran wealth enhancement in practice the process of making a backdoor roth ira contribution is straightforward but the documentation and reporting at tax time may be confusing whether you work with a professional tax preparer use tax software such as turbotax or complete your taxes by hand understanding the mechanics of the money movements can help ensure you file your taxes correctly let’s say you make a contribution to your traditional ira if your income is too high to qualify for a deduction for the ira contribution the contribution is considered nondeductible your advisor doesn’t let the custodian such as charles schwab fidelity or td ameritrade know whether the contribution is deductible – you report it at tax time on irs form  nondeductible iras you use the form to keep track of basis in your traditional ira and basis in this sense means aftertax contributions to make sure you don’t pay tax on those exact dollars twice after you make the nondeductible ira contribution it’s converted ie transferred from your traditional ira to your roth ira account from that point on those dollars are now roth ira assets and aren’t subject to future tax on earnings if the conversion is never made you’ll have basis ie aftertax contributions in your traditional ira that you’ll need irs form  to keep track of this ensures you aren’t subject to income taxes on withdrawals of that basis in the future such as in retirement around taxtime you’ll receive a r from your custodian showing the distribution from your traditional ira that was converted to your roth ira the previous year after tax time closer to may you’ll receive an information reporting form  that shows the contribution you made to the traditional ira and the amount that was converted to roth ira for purposes of reconciliation and recordkeeping let’s walk through the reporting process for a backdoor roth ira read more… things to remember around tax time if you’ve made a qualified charitable distribution by geoffrey curran  jun    charitable giving geoff curran wealth enhancement form r is issued around tax time to report distributions you took during the previous year from a retirement account among other things this form tells you and the irs how much was withdrawn in total how much of the distribution was taxable and whether there was any withholding for federal and state income taxes for those who gave part or all of their required minimum distribution directly to charity through making a qualified charitable distribution qcd this amount is still included in the taxable portion of your total distribution on form r as you’ll see the qcd is included in your gross distribution box  and taxable amount box a however the box for “taxable amount not determined” box b will be checked whether you work with a professional tax preparer use software like turbotax or prepare your own taxes by hand it can be easy to forget that the qcd portion of your distribution should not be included in your taxable income on your tax return it’s important to keep a record of any qcds made during the year and hold on to the receipts or letters that you receive from the charities confirming receipt of the funds below is a blank version of the r available on the irs website   this is a copy of a r issued by td ameritrade in this example the individual had a  gross line  and taxable distribution line a the box next to “taxable amount not determined” line b is checked federal income tax of  was withheld line  the distribution was considered a “normal distribution” because the distribution code  was used line  what this r doesn’t tell you is that  of this individual’s rmd was a qcd while the remaining  of the withdrawal was taxable you should put the information from the r on the first page of your tax return form  on line a and b shown below in the example the individual had a total ira distribution of  of this distribution  was a qcd this means that the qcd won’t be included in your taxable income if you have the option write “qcd” to the left of box b on your tax return you need to add the  federal income tax withheld from this ira distribution to any other federal withholdings from ws andor s for the year on line  page  of your tax return if you had basis aftertax contributions in the traditional ira from which you made the qcd and took a regular distribution you must remember to file irs form  nondeductible iras you must also file this form if you made a qcd from your roth ira while we would not suggest making a qcd from a roth ira since the account is aftertax versus pretax you can do that by reporting qcd’s correctly on your tax return you rightfully receive the benefit of income exclusion ask merriman required minimum distribution rmd by chris waclawik  jun    ask merriman chris waclawik q i turned  ½ in  but waited until march  to take my first required minimum distribution rmd i planned to wait until  to take my next distribution am i understanding correctly that i must take the second rmd in  too you are only allowed to delay your rmd the first year you take it you can delay as late at april  of the year after you turn  ½ in every subsequent year the rmd must be completed by december  of that year if you delay taking your rmd the first year it means you will have to take two rmds in your second year   q are roth accounts subject to an annual required minimum distribution rmd i thought only traditional retirement accounts were but i’ve been hearing differently roth iras are not subject to an annual rmd however if your employer offers a roth k that is subject to annual rmds upon reaching age  ½ fortunately if you want to avoid taking distributions it’s possible to complete a rollover from the roth k to the roth ira this should allow you to avoid having to take an annual rmd from your roth money   q do the required minimum distributions rmds from iras that become effective in the year i turn   ½ apply only to iras or do they also apply to ks more specifically if i am still working full time does the rmd requirement apply to my k if you’re still working when you turn  ½ you may not need to take an rmd from the k at your current employer if the following conditions are met you’re employed throughout the entire year you own no more than  of the company you participate in a plan that allows you to delay rmds you must take your first rmd from the k the year you retire in that year you have until april  of the following year to take the distribution however if you delay you‘ll end up taking two rmds the second year the rmds that become effective the year you turn  ½ still apply to all traditional iras and all other ks and roth ks   q if i decide to give my rmd to my church do i need to give the entire withdrawal amount required by the irs or can i just give a portion and keep the rest for other living expenses you don’t need to give the entire rmd amount to your church or any charity to complete a qualified charitable distribution qcd the qcd can be less than or more than the rmd up to a  limit per taxpayer per year a taxpayer with a  rmd in  could certainly make a  qcd and take the rest as a regular distribution for living expenses the key points to remember when completing the qualified charitable distribution from an ira to a charity are that the ira owner must already be age  ½ on the date of distribution submit a distribution form to the ira custodian requesting that the check be made payable directly to the charity ensure that no tax withholding is being made from the qcd to the charity send the check directly to the charity or to the ira owner to be forwarded along to the charity   do you have a question about investments taxes retirement or insurance send it to “ask merriman” and one of our financial advisors will help you find an answer a more efficient way to give donoradvised funds by geoffrey curran  may    charitable giving geoff curran being philanthropic can mean you donate your time expertise andor financial resources to support a charitable organization when donating financial resources there are ways to give that maximize the benefit of the gift did you write a check if so

agreed upon merriman deducts these fees automatically from each managed account after the completion of the monthly billing period each fee withdrawal is reflected on the client s monthly account statement sent by the relevant custodian merriman directly invoices a limited number of clients ie less than  of all clients quarterly in advance because of special circumstances the fees for these accounts are based on each account s market value at the end of the previous quarter because these fees are paid outside the clients accounts they are not reflected on statements sent by the custodian accounts initiated or terminated during a billing period are charged a item  fees and compensation merriman does not work on commission lgo pays merriman as its investment manager a monthly allowance for expense reimbursement calculated as  of lgo s net assets per year and a performance allocation equal to  of profits earned by lgo during each fiscal year subject to a highwater mark each lgo investor bears its proportionate share of that compensation except when merriman has agreed to waive or reduce any such amounts for an investor in addition to the foregoing compensation payable to merriman thirdparty fund administration and audit expenses are paid out of lgo assets  item  cont prorated fee based on the number of days the account was under merriman s management in the relevant period when an account is terminated merriman promptly refunds any prepaid unearned fees any earned unpaid fees become due and payable at that time merriman charges a  monthly penalty for overdue

other related costs and expenses which may be charged by custodians brokers mutual funds and other third parties when managed account assets are invested in mutual funds or other investment products merriman strives to select lowcost noload funds for its clients all clients should be aware that investment products generally charge their investors internal management fees and investmentrelated expenses incurred on their behalf these fees can be found in the investment product s prospectus and generally are reflected in the reported performance information no part of the thirdparty fees and costs described above is received by merriman or any of its employees see item  for more information about how merriman chooses and recommends brokerdealers for client transactions and evaluates the reasonableness of their charges item  performancebased fees and sidebyside management in addition to the performance allocation from lgo described in item  merriman has negotiated performancebased fee arrangements collectively performance fees  for managed accounts in a limited number of cases for qualified clients merriman structures performance fees in accordance with section a of the investment advisers act of  the advisers act  and the available exemptions thereunder including the exemption set forth in rule the performance fees payable to merriman for these accounts are based on both realized and unrealized gains and losses in each account merriman manages performancebased fee accounts and lgo sidebyside with accounts not subject to performance fees because of this merriman faces certain conflicts of interest including the incentive to allocate potentially more favorable investment opportunities to the accounts subject to the performance fees because merriman shares in the potentially superior performance of such investment opportunities to minimize these conflicts of interest merriman chooses to manage all accounts including the performancebased fee accounts using the same models for all accounts within a trading strategy additionally merriman has procedures in place to address such conflicts of interest with trade order allocations for example if an investment is not fully available for all accounts for which merriman seeks to make the investment the amount of available investment will be allocated to the relevant accounts pro rata based on the amount of the order originally made for each account further if block trades in such an investment are made at different prices the investment will be allocated to all affected accounts on the basis of the average price for such trades item  cont the majority of merriman clients are individuals and households who are either saving money and planning for retirement or already retired merriman also manages some accounts for pension and profitsharing plans trusts estates charitable organizations as well as corporations or other business entities merriman program or accountlevel requirements are as follows marketwise no restrictions apply trendwise  minimum in each trendwise account  minimum in each trendwise account leveraged global opportunity fund  minimum in the program available only to investors who meet the eligibility requirements described in lgo s offering documents merriman at its discretion may reduce the foregoing minimum investment requirements lgo eligibility requirements generally cannot be waived item  types of clients most merriman clients are individuals and households who are planning for retirement or are already retired no investment is free of risks current and prospective merriman clients are cautioned that investments in securities involve risk of loss including the possibility of a complete loss of the amount invested all investors should be prepared to bear these risks one of merriman s top priorities is to make sure clients understand the investment risks they choose to take and help them select investment strategies that are appropriate for their risk tolerance investors should note that all merrimanadvised portfolios and lgo invest all or a substantial portion of their assets in mutual funds and etfs investors are urged to consult the prospectus or other offering document of each such mutual fund or etf for additional risks and other considerations item  methods of analysis investment strategies and risk of loss core investment programs merriman offers two core investment programs for its clients which can be used individually or in combination as appropriate for the client s investment portfolio marketwise generally remains fully invested with an adjustable asset allocation to meet client return objectives and risk tolerances trendwise is an activelymanaged trendfollowing strategy applying active risk management techniques to shift investments across asset classes as market conditions change each of these programs seeks to achieve favorable longterm growth with less risk than other similar investment products  item  cont marketwise portfolios are generally fully invested marketwise marketwise is a globally diversified core investment program based on academic research it relies primarily on lowcost mutual funds and is generally fully invested the mutual funds used and their allocation are determined by merriman s research team subject to oversight by merriman s investment committee the portfolios are not actively traded but are regularly rebalanced to target allocations marketwise is managed with the view that markets for traditional asset classes are generally efficient most active managers fail to beat their benchmark over the long term after fees and taxes and it is very difficult to predict which few managers will outperform the indexes in the short term careful allocation of investments across a wide variety of diverse asset classes and wide diversification within each asset class helps to improve returns and reduce risk it is best to invest with a longerterm perspective as it is difficult to forecast the relative performance of markets and asset classes over the shorter term within stocks overweighting value and smallcap has historically resulted in superior longerterm returns investors benefit from periodic rebalancing in order to maintain desired portfolio weights respectful of the client s riskreward objectives this leads to trimming asset classes which have done well and buying those asset classes which have not done as well selling high and buying low marketwise applies a portfolio of mutual funds selected by merriman s research team after thorough evaluation and due diligence which considers the fund strategies potential risks and returns net of fees as well as considerations regarding the associated fund company merriman updates its analysis regarding the funds it uses on a regular basis no less than annually and also regularly considers other available alternative funds and vendors funds are replaced if merriman s risk and return objectives are not being satisfied if another alternative appears more appropriate or based on a strategic shift in asset allocation merriman receives no compensation from any investment product company since  the stock allocations of marketwise portfolios have been invested in noload stock mutual funds managed by dimensional fund advisors  dfa  available to individuals only through registered investment advisers such as merriman dfa stock portfolios are similar to index funds in that expenses and turnover tend to be low dfa equity funds are distinguished from typical index funds as they are managed with tilts toward value and smallcap stocks and also companies meeting certain profitability criteria for taxable client accounts merriman may seek greater tax efficiencies by relying on taxmanaged stock funds the stock exposure in marketwise generally includes us and international stock markets including emerging markets with smallcap midcap and largecap funds as well as us and international real estate investment trusts  reits  in taxdeferred accounts marketwise bond allocations generally rely on mutual funds that hold shortterm and intermediateterm bonds to control risk in taxable accounts merriman seeks greater tax efficiency by relying on municipal bond funds nontraditional asset classes may also be used within marketwise portfolios to enhance diversification andor potential returns one such asset class introduced for wealth management clients in late  is insurance linked securities ils ils is an emerging asset class which offers equitylike returns bondlike return mechanics and a potential yield dependent on property and casualty reinsurance risk premiums rather than interest rates or economic trends as such merriman believes this asset class offers unique diversification attributes due to its very low correlation with traditional asset classes this noncorrelation enables materially enhanced portfolio diversification particularly at times of financial crises when traditional asset classes have tended to decline in tandem marketwise portfolios are generally fully invested which exposes clients to the risk of market declines marketwise accounts can have different levels of exposure to stocks and thus different levels of risk in general each marketwise account makes an allocation to both stocks and bonds although accounts holding only stocks or only bonds may be possible in certain circumstances each account is customized to a client s individual risk tolerance by adjusting the individual stockbond allocation eg  invested in stocks and  in bonds merriman periodically rebalances client accounts to maintain the agreedupon target allocations marketwise portfolios are subject to material risks including but not limited to general economic conditions and market disruptions prices of the securities in which the marketwise portfolios invest may be volatile due to general economic conditions and market movements market movements are difficult to predict and are influenced by among other things government fiscal monetary and exchange control programs changing supply and demand relationships political and economic conditions and interest rate trends imbalances in financial markets adverse economic conditions may affect the financial markets in the united states and elsewhere and may promote supply and demand imbalances within stock bond and other markets because the securities held by the marketwise portfolios are marked to market and fluctuate in value based on supply and demand this in turn could adversely affect the value of the portfolios assets if many mutual fund investors sought to redeem their shares at the same time mutual fund companies could be forced to sell their investments at lower prices in order to meet redemption requests investments in mutual funds and other investment vehicles marketwise portfolios may invest all of their assets in mutual funds etfs and other item  cont  item  cont investment vehicles as described above such vehicles incur management and other fees and expenses related to their investment programs as further described in the offering documents of such vehicles these fees and expenses will reduce the returns achieved by the portfolios investments in equity securities in general the valuations of stocks are subject to market risk including changes in economic conditions profit levels growth rates and interest rates while offering greater potential for longterm growth stocks are more volatile and more risky than some other investments investments in smallcap companies marketwise portfolios may invest in the stocks of smallcapitalization companies these companies tend to be subject to more limited product lines and endmarkets andor fewer financial resources than larger companies smaller companies may also be more dependent on a few key members of management and may issue securities that are more thinly traded which may therefore be subject to greater volatility and potential losses than the securities of larger companies nonus investments investments made through marketwise portfolios in nonus issuers or securities principally traded outside the united states may involve special risks due to economic political and legal developments including changes in currency exchange rates exchange control regulations expropriation of assets or nationalization imposition of withholding taxes on dividends or interest payments and less comprehensive accounting reporting and disclosure requirements investments in debt securities debt securities or bonds are subject to various types of risk including but not limited to interestrate risk is the likelihood that bond prices will decline if interest rates rise merriman believes that marketwise portfolios mitigate but do not eliminate interestrate risk by emphasizing shortand intermediateterm maturities and avoiding longterm bonds which are most sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the possibility that some issuers of bonds will default on all or part of their interest and principal obligations merriman believes credit risk can be mitigated but not entirely eliminated by investing some or all of the bond portion of a portfolio in obligations of the us treasury and us agencies treasuries and government agency bonds are generally considered to be subject to less credit risk than most other bonds but return premiums tend to be lower due to the perceived lower risk for some accounts merriman invests in municipal bonds which generally have higher credit risk than treasuries and government agency bonds merriman generally does not invest in corporate debt for marketwise accounts based on an assessment of each marketwise client s investment objective merriman may incorporate a mix of investments to appropriately balance the risk reward characteristics prepayment risk is the risk that mortgage borrowers may prepay their loan more quickly when interest rates decline and prepay at a slower pace when interest rates rise which could result in adverse return implications for holders of mortgagerelated investments such as bonds backed by the government national mortgage association gnma investments in insurance linked securities investments in insurance linked securities ils are subject to various types of risk the primary risk relates to reinsurance triggering events for example i natural catastrophes such as hurricanes tornados or earthquakes of a particular sizemagnitude in a designated geographic area or ii nonnatural events such as large commercial accidents eg marine or aviation such events if they occur at unanticipated frequencies or severities could result in reduced investment returns for ils investors and even the loss of principal there is no way to predict with complete accuracy whether a triggering event will occur and because of this significant uncertainty ils carry a high degree of risk merriman will seek to mitigate the risks associated with ils investments by pursuing a strategy of broad diversification within the asset class across geographies and triggering events valuation risk is the risk that the ils is priced incorrectly due to factors such as incomplete data market instability model  human error in addition pricing of ils is subject to the added uncertainty caused by the inability to generally predict whether when or where a natural disaster or other triggering event will occur investments in illiquid securities marketwise portfolios may invest in alternative investment funds andor securities which may be subject to liquidity constraints such limitations may affect the timing and degree of desired fund purchases and sales and thereby portfolio rebalancings merriman considers the client s objectives and may consult with some clients in its determination whether such investments holdings may be suitable and if so to what extent trendwise trendwise uses active risk management through a trendfollowing strategy in an attempt to decrease losses in major bear markets this program may be beneficial for clients who are especially anxious about the ups and downs of the markets who have a history of liquidating investments at the wrong times who believe in the benefits of trend following or who prefer to diversify by investing in both active and passive riskmanagement strategies trendwise portfolios may invest in etfs etns exchange traded notes and mutual funds excluding dfa funds and employ a disciplined trendfollowing approach maintained by merriman s research team these systems are applied to us stocks international stocks bonds reits and potentially other asset classes such as commodities within each asset class item  cont trendwise uses active risk management in an attempt to decrease losses in major bear markets  item  cont merriman offers two variations of trendwise to accomodate differences in risk tolerance among clients merriman may invest in multiple funds each of which is governed by an independent trendfollowing timing system when a trendfollowing system triggers a buy or sell signal the purchase or sale is made and the funds are withdrawn from or invested in a money market fund or a shortterm treasury fund merriman s research team is responsible for managing the investment and reinvestment of assets in trendwise accounts merriman offers two variations of trendwise trendwise which has been used for merriman portfolios since  and trendwise which was started in when conditions warrant trendwise portfolios can be completely out of the market and fully invested in cash or shortterm treasuries in trendwise portfolios merriman always maintains some stock exposure which allows a maximum of  of the stock portion to be out of the market and invested in cash or shortterm treasuries this increases the risk of market losses as well as the potential for market gains relative to trendwise twenty percent of the stock allocation of trendwise is always invested in an asset class rotation strategy in which various asset classes are purchased and sold based on price momentum that means for example that a trendwise account which allocates  to stocks would always have at least  of its assets in stock funds ie  of  the investment objective for each trendwise portfolio is to attain a longterm return similar to that of the broad markets without trend following for a comparable allocation between stocks and bonds with less risk merriman believes that trendwise provides a slightly higher riskadjusted return than trendwise over the long run however trendwise may be a more suitable program for investors who want to be completely in cash or shortterm treasuries when stock markets are falling while trendwise portfolios are designed to reduce longterm investment risk no timing system eliminates risk and in general none react quickly enough to protect investors from a sudden dramatic market decline because merriman s timing systems follow trends instead of trying to predict them shortterm trading losses cannot be eliminated in trendwise portfolios when prices of stock bond and other asset class securities begin falling there is always some lag time before merriman s trendfollowing systems indicate assets should be sold thus merriman will rarely if ever sell trendwise assets at the most advantageous prices likewise when market prices begin rising there is always some lag time before merriman s systems indicate purchases should be made therefore merriman will rarely if ever buy trendwise assets at the most advantageous prices as a result it is common for parts of trendwise portfolios to be negatively affected by shortterm market volatility such as whipsaw trades this can occur for example in the following sequence  a fund s price falls enough for merriman s trendfollowing system to trigger a sell signal  the fund is sold and the proceeds are invested in cash or shortterm treasuries  the fund s price begins rising and  merriman s trendfollowing system does not trigger a buy signal until the fund s price is higher than the price at the time of sale as a result a trendwise portfolio could end up holding fewer shares of a fund than it previously owned although such events are counterproductive in the short term merriman believes the systems are worthwhile in the long term while merriman s systems are designed to protect clients from major bear markets there is no guarantee they will succeed while merriman adjusts the sensitivity of its systems to minimize false alarms it involves a tradeoff any system that is more sensitive will generate more shortterm volatility and frustrations while a lesssensitive system that avoids volatility may not react quickly enough to avert major market losses in addition to the material risks applicable to marketwise portfolios set out above trendwise portfolios are subject to material risks including but not limited to highyield bonds trendwise portfolios may invest in highyield bonds which are generally rated below investment grade or unrated and may be considered speculative in general issuers of highyield bonds are particularly susceptible to adverse business financial and economic conditions and are generally more highly leveraged and have fewer financial resources than issuers of investmentgrade bonds any adverse economic development affecting an issuer of highyield bonds may cause the issuer to be unable to make timely interest or principal payments accordingly highyield bond values are generally more susceptible to adverse economic developments and market disruptions than investmentgrade bond values bank loan funds trendwise may invest in bank loan funds which may have substantial credit risk similar to highyield bonds bank loan funds are generally more susceptible to adverse economic developments and market disruptions than investmentgrade bond values build america bonds trendwise may invest in build america bonds babs which are taxable longterm bonds issued by municipalities these bonds have the credit risk of the municipalities substantial interest rate risk since they are longterm and may be impacted by political decisions to implement new babs programs or curtail current programs emerging market debt trendwise may invest in emerging market debt denominated either in us dollars or local currency emerging market debt may be rated below investment grade or unrated and may be considered speculative emerging market debt will be influenced by economic and political factors specific to each country and region emerging market debt may be less liquid than other bonds during times of a financial crisis commodities trendwise may use etfs or etns to invest in gold other commodities and commodity producers in an effort to offset the impacts item  cont  item  cont of inflation on the portfolio investing in commodities involves a variety of risks including potential price volatility the shape of the forward demand curve for the commodity supply and demand shocks and the lack of perfect correlation with short and longterm inflation currency carry trendwise may invest in etfs or etns which look to benefit from the carry trade of borrowing in a low interest rate currency and investing in a high interest rate currency adverse movements in currencies interest rates and liquidity could decrease the price of these securities exchange traded notes etns unlike etfs etns depend on the credit risk of the issuer which is typically a major financial institution etns are structured as unsecured debt of the issuer any financial instability of the issuer may impact the price of the etns independent of the underlying asset class if the issuer went bankrupt etn holders would become unsecured creditors of the issuer trendfollowing limitations merriman s trendfollowing systems which generate buy and sell decisions for the trendwise portfolios use historical information and analysis of current trends to determine when to buy and sell investments because past performance does not guarantee future results there is no assurance that merriman s trendfollowing systems will make favorable buy or sell decisions or protect clients from adverse consequences of significant or unprecedented market volatility or disruptions lgo is

cont lgo invests in peertopeer loans  pp  that do not have readily available pricing so merriman has adopted the following valuation process the pp loan portfolio is valued on a discount cash flow basis reflecting expected losses voluntary prepayments discount rates based on latest published riskadjusted expected rates of return and cure rates for noncurrent loans the monthly rates of principal prepayment and loss timing are based on gradelevel average principal balance vectors grade level loss rates are scaled to reflect the expected loss rates at origination for each loan for each credit grade the appropriate discount rate is assumed to be the current lossadjusted expected return for the same type of product further adjusted for the remaining duration of the loan the net present value of each noncurrent loan is scaled down by the payment status multiplier reflecting the historical probability of returning to current status research and accounting departments independently follow a checklist for completing the valuation and creating the necessary accounting entries on a monthly basis for backup and control purposes the valuation committee consisting of chief compliance officer

each trade order specifying each participating account and its allocation prior to the entry of the aggregated order completed orders are allocated as specified in the initial trade order partially filled orders are allocated on a prorata basis based on the amount of the order for each account any exceptions will be explained on the trade order investors should note that because merriman employees may invest in the same securities as clients there is a possibility that employees might benefit from market activity by a client in a security held by an employee however item  cont item  code of ethics participation or interest in client transactions and personal trading merriman has a legal obligation to put clients interests ahead of its own  item  cont given the modest size of employee trades in relation to the size of the mutual funds and etfs in client portfolios merriman believes that employee trading is unlikely to have any material impact on purchase or sales prices experienced by clients employees are not provided advance notice of lgo trades in addition employees are required to report their trading activity quarterly and their securities holdings annually and these reports are reviewed internally the code of ethics designates certain classes of securities including without limitation shares of openend mutual funds as exempt from reporting based upon exemptions provided under applicable federal securities laws currently it is merriman s policy that merriman will not affect any principal or agency cross securities transactions for client accounts merriman will also not cause client accounts to enter into securities trades with each other principal transactions are generally defined as transactions where an adviser acting as principal for its own account or the account of an affiliated brokerdealer buys from or sells any security to any advisory client a principal transaction may also be deemed to have occurred if a security is traded between an affiliated fund such as lgo and another client account an agency cross transaction is generally defined as a transaction in which a person acts as an investment adviser in relation to a transaction in which the investment adviser acts as a broker for both the advisory client and for another person on the other side of the transaction agency cross transactions may arise if an adviser is dually registered as a brokerdealer or has an affiliated brokerdealer neither of these circumstances currently applies to merriman and this brochure will be updated if that changes in the future

investment portfolios can be held at charles schwab fidelity or td ameritrade in seeking best execution through a brokerdealer on behalf of merriman s clients the determinative factor for merriman is not the lowest possible cost but whether the transaction represents the best qualitative execution merriman takes into consideration the full range of brokerdealer services including historical relationship reputation financial strength the value of any research provided execution capability commission rates and responsiveness merriman s best execution responsibility is qualified by the fact

etfs etns and similar vehicles and instruments which are custodied at schwab and interactive brokers pp notes are purchased through prosper marketplace inc if lgo invests directly in other securities it may effect such transactions through a variety of brokerdealers merriman may recommend that clients establish brokerage accounts with schwab fidelity td ameritrade or interactive brokers collectively the custodians  to maintain custody of clients assets and to effect trades for their accounts the custodians provide merriman with access to their institutional trading and operational services which are typically not available to retail investors these services are generally available to independent investment advisors such as merriman on an unsolicited basis and at no additional cost to merriman or its clients the custodians services include brokerage custody research and access to mutual funds and other investments that are otherwise generally available only to institutional investors or that would require a significantly higher minimum initial investment the custodians generally do not charge separately for custody of merriman client accounts but are compensated by account holders through commissions transactionrelated fees or assetbased fees for securities trades fee schedules vary between the custodians so merriman clients in the same investment program but with accounts at different custodians will have varying costs in addition the custodians may not offer the exact same securities for trading so individual securities in client accounts may vary within investment programs the custodians also make available to merriman other products and services that benefit merriman s business but may not directly benefit its clients accounts this is not a material consideration for merriman when it recommends that a client utilize a particular custodian s services some of these other products and services assist merriman in managing and administering clients accounts these include software and other technology that provide access to client account data such as trade confirmations and account statements facilitate trade execution and allocation of

pay for these types of services rendered to merriman by independent third parties the custodians may discount or waive fees it would otherwise charge for some of these services or pay all or a part of the fees of a thirdparty providing these services to merriman while as a fiduciary merriman endeavors to act in its clients best interests merriman s recommendation that clients maintain their assets in accounts at the custodians may be based in part on the benefit to merriman of the availability of some of the foregoing products and services and not solely on the nature cost or quality of custody and brokerage services provided by the custodians which creates a conflict of interest ultimately it is the client s decision to custody assets with a particular custodian merriman is independently owned and operated and not affiliated with the custodians there is no corresponding commitment made by merriman to the custodians or any other entity to invest any specific amount or percentage of client assets in any specific mutual funds securities or other investment products merriman consistent with its best execution obligation negotiates fee arrangements with the custodians that merriman
