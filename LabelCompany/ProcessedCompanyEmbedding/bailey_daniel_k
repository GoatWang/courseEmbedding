the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily

custody child support alimony and equitable distribution a greensboro attorney highly recommended carolyn woodruff at woodruff family law group i ended up meeting family law specialist jessica bullock and from the start i really enjoyed the business relationship – the best words to describe jessica  an intelligent and caring professional i did not feel like she would just push around some papers for me with all that was involved in my case i needed someone who would be professional and effective in court while also being able to communicate with me at a human to human level the staff members at woodruff family law group were polite made sure that i was comfortable and continuously communicated what i could expect in all situations that aroseany parent who wants someone to take the time to relate to them on a human level understand the north carolina law and how it applies to their own situation with effective and skilled representation should consider contacting woodruff family law group jessica bullock was the right attorney for me i knew i wanted to be an involved dad with my children but felt there were a lot of variables to work through and woodruff family law group has been a wise investment in that future and the future of my children when dealing with divorce and child custody roane lawrhonda n ratedi cant not say enough wonderful things about mr roane and his staff in june of  i was rear ended while sitting at a stoplight  after a week of dealing with cynical insurance persons i sought legal help of course i chose a well known and widely advised legal firm that i thought would stand up for you little did i know until just months before my witching hour meaning my filing dead line that they will only stand up for you if your case is easy cut and dry my case was not going to be easy so they dropped me within minutes of my husband and i sitting down in mr roanes office and talking with him i knew we were where i needed to be he and his staff especially meranda guided advised and reassured me every step of the way they believed in me and they showed it i learned that insurance companies were wary of facing mr roane in courtand they knew he would meet them in courthes not intimidated in my case the insurance company was so unwilling to meet us in court they agreed to a settlement my settlement was unprecedented unusual and the insurance company insisted we all sign nondisclosure agreements they definitely didnt want the monetary settlement disclosed five stars isnt enough for roane law they deserve way more woodruff family law groupdeborah j ratedi came to the firm to get a divorce and divide the marital estate during the course of our time working together what has impressed me the most is what carolyn woodruff has been able to pull from the file cabinets of her memory regarding detailed aspects of my case carolyn has also been a safe haven during a time of being very concerned with my wellbeing when i think of carolyn i would say she is intelligent quick on her feet a quick thinker and very friendly and warm in times of stress and duress she has a calming effect about her overall the woodruff family law group is efficient the staff members have all become family they offer a family environment i have felt i could call on anyone day or night communication lines are always open with the length of time my case has taken it would have been easy to slip to the back of the firm’s caseload that doesn’t happen at woodruff law offices of john t orcuttkathy r ratedto the paralegals i went into the office feeling very depressed but the paralegals assured me that they would do everything to help me get back on the right track they help me to get back to a very stable financial lifestyle without having to worry how i am going to afford to pay all of the bills each month they started the paperwork right away and file my bankruptcy claim in a timely manner so i wouldt have to worry about losing my home to foreclosure and made it really affordable they took the stress out of worrying how or when each payment will be due especially the first payment  which really worries me it is the hardest because you are still struggling to pay all your other expenses along with saving up for bankruptcy payment i enjoyed working the paralegals they were an excellent team good job to the law office of john t orcutt a very warm thank you from kathy danita rileylaw office of robert n weckworth jrdejavu w ratedmy name is lyle i have spoken to mr weckworth who so far has been very helpful in assisting me with my case while taking the time to speak with me without consultation fees yet remain attentive for a long duration while we discuss the possibilities a few of the other attorneys seemed in a hurry to just get me off the phone he has offered me a reasonable price for his services as it seems to be a simple case other attorneys wanted to charge much more to me this shows a sign of honesty so far i am very pleased with his assistance i will of course follow up after the court date at this point i would recommend contacting him yourself to see how he can help you as well roane lawtara b ratedno one wants to need a lawyer but after a car wreck i did james roane was highly recommended to me and we chose to meet with him to review my case after meeting him i realized he knew what needed to be done and the way to handle

decisions that were made they did not just make decisions for me it was a true pleasure to work with such a dedicated and knowledgeable group who had my best interest at hand i would highly recommend

inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if

you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their

tradition by james p bailey review brian hamilton from journal of the society of christian ethicsvolume  number  fallwinter  pp   sce in lieu of an abstract here is a brief excerpt of the content reviewed by brian hamilton review of the moral dynamics of economic life an extension and critique of caritas in veritate edited by daniel k finn new york oxford university press   pp  review of rethinking poverty income assets and the catholic social justice tradition james p bailey notre dame in university of notre dame press   pp  the academic study of catholic social teaching has flowered in recent years the moral vision elaborated over a century of official catholic documents on social and political issues has proven attractive to a wide variety of scholars providing a point of reference for interdisciplinary conversation by bringing that vision into conversation with their respective disciplines such scholars have gone a long way toward addressing one of the most common complaints about catholic social teaching that its proposals are too general and abstract two recent books both working at the intersection of theology and economics are a case in point the moral dynamics of economic life edited by daniel finn synthesizes a conversation held in rome in  under the aegis of the institute of advanced catholic studies and the pontifical council for justice and peace theologians philosophers public policy experts lawyers businesspeople and church leaders gathered to discuss the significance of benedict xvi’s social encyclical caritas in veritate for the us context rather than simply reprinting the papers they discussed the participants’ contributions were split up and reorganized along thematic lines there are eleven chapters—on topics like reciprocity development and polarization in us political discourse—each composed of a series of two to fourpage essays from different scholars it is a creative and surprisingly effective structure no single argument is developed at any length of course but the essays punchy and provocative accomplish far more than one would think possible in so short a space taken together they define the contours of a much richer conversation than a series of independent papers could have done end page  james bailey’s rethinking poverty provides a more sustained argument working within the moral framework provided by catholic social teaching bailey argues that us public policy regarding poverty needs to focus less on income relief and more on asset ownership and development he lays out his basic case for the “asset paradigm” in chapter  in the current system assetbuilding assistance is provided almost exclusively to the nonpoor rather than to the poor since it is mediated primarily through the federal income tax—which the poor do not pay income assistance to the poor though crucial in the short term does nothing to address the root causes of endemic poverty in the united states in fact the regressive structure of assetbuilding assistance has itself played an important role in perpetuating and exacerbating the wealth gap in this country in the next two chapters bailey lays out two complementary moral frameworks that support a policy shift toward an asset paradigm catholic social teaching and the “capabilities approach” developed by martha nussbaum and amartya sen in the fourth chapter bailey surveys the history of racialized asset discrimination in us policy demonstrating that the denial of assetbased assistance has been instrumental in creating enduring wealth disparities between white and black communities in the fifth chapter bailey concludes by suggesting that an older neglected american policy tradition did privilege an assetsbased approach to poverty relief and that tradition continues to be a viable option both books succeed in my judgment in rendering the principles and priorities of catholic social teaching more concrete bailey’s main goal obviously is to recommend a specific policy orientation and moral dynamics is full of practical suggestions we should encourage conversations between theology and business schools at catholic universities   we should give more attention to empirical measures of wellbeing and development beyond narrowly economic ones like the gross domestic product – we should work to redefine the standard of “reasonableness” in the common law tort system to include a broader commitment to social responsibility – and so on both books also helpfully clarify certain principles of catholic social teaching at a conceptual level

of impossibility is a unique undertaking that reexamines the poetic site of the fragment as thought following a heritage of fragmented aphoristic thinkers including pascal nietzsche kierkegaard and

and seemingly paradoxical fact ruda demonstrates how real freedom conceptually presupposes the assumption that the worst has always already happened in short fatalism in this brisk and witty

that the only answer—if we are to have any hope of tackling the past present and future of colonialism disease pollution and climate change—is a resounding yes proposing a powerful new conception of social movements as custodians for the past and incubators for liberated futures againstpurity undertakes an analysis that draws on theories of race disability gender and animal ethics as a foundation

save citation alasdair macintyre charles taylor and the demise of naturalism reunifying political theory and social science jason blakely today the ethical and normative concerns of everyday citizens are all too often sidelined from the study of political and social issues driven out by an effort to create a more “scientific” study this book offers a way for social scientists and political theorists to reintegrate the empirical and the normative proposing a way out of the scientism that clouds our age in alasdair macintyre charles taylor and the demise of naturalism jason blakely argues

absolute nietzsche and merleauponty on the question of truth frank chouraqui friedrich nietzsche and maurice merleauponty chouraqui argues are linked by how they conceive the question of truth although both thinkers criticize the traditional concept of truth as objectivity they both find that rejecting it does not solve the problem what is it in our natural existence that gave rise to the notion of truththe answer to that question is threefold first nietzsche and merleauponty both propose a genealogy of “truth” in which to exist means to make implicit truth claims second both seek to recover the preobjective ground from which truth as an erroneous concept arose finally this attempt at recovery leads both thinkers to ontological considerations regarding how we must conceive of a being whose structure allows for the existence of the belief in truth in conclusion chouraqui suggests that both thinkers’ investigations of the question of truth lead them to conceive of being as the
