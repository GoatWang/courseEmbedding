demonstration   qmast llc has developed a revolutionary technology for the removal of hydrocarbons from oil shale tar sands tight shales and conventional oil and gas reservoirs using a high power microwave hpm system a prototype system of  kilowatts equivalent to  microwave ovens has been built and tested the system pictured above was designed to remediate contaminated soils building on the success of the prototype system the hpm system extends the technology to oil and gas applications by using a conventional well with a phasedarray antenna to emit a focused high energy microwave beam that selectively heats water and hydrocarbons fractures the rock and efficiently removes hydrocarbonsthe hpm system can replace conventional hydrofracturing and eliminate the need for large quantities of water and chemicals that are injected into the ground and the associated disposal costs the system is an environmentally sound method for hydrocarbon extraction and provides significant benefits for carbon sequestering our web site provides information on this exciting technology please enjoy reading about the hpm system and contact us with any questions company news qmast welcomes dr adil al

marks to search for articles share energy company focusing on shale firm patented new technique will move to gj by charles ashby thursday july   the grand valley has landed yet another new company that hopes to change the way oil is extracted from the ground that its owners say could bring the industry back to western colorado thanks to a new tax credit program approved by the colorado legislature last year the company qualified as the seventh under the rural jumpstart tax credit program called general synfuels international the company has patented a way to remove oil and natural gas from shale that it says not only is environmentally safe but economically feasible using a technique called insitu processing the company uses a heat conduit to free oil and gas from the shale all of which happens below ground meaning nothing is released into the atmosphere said dave kanuch vice president and chief engineer for the company kanuch said the technology has the potential to be “a real gamechanger” when it comes to oil and gas development for the west “we’re not extracting the oil shale like a lot of people have tried” he said “our process is different in that we are extracting synthetic hydrocarbons from the oil shale it’s kind of an upsidedown refinery” while insitu isn’t new the company’s way of doing it is it involves pumping heated gases into the bottom of a production well which raises the temperature of the surrounding rock and oilshale layers the company says the continuous heating of that rock and shale creates a hydrocarbon mix of hot gases which then flow into a second conduit that is anchored to the opening of the well the process produces medium and light crude oil and associated gases such as hydrogen methane propane and butane kanuch said adding that the company plans to have a prototype completed by  if that works the company will test the process in a deeper well with the hope that if all works as planned they’ll be in full production not long after that “the component of oil shale which is kerogen is what we’re really after” he said “it’s a highly complex molecule and we believe our process breaks that down to a manageable state where we can synthesize it on the surface we don’t use any water we’re actually a net water producer” kanach said the company expects to hire  people this year and another  next year with the possibility of  to  after that if the technology proves to be viable he said it could generate hundreds of secondary drilling and construction jobs as the company starts to pull oil from the shale the addition of gsi makes three oil and gasrelated companies to be included in the jumpstart program which provides tax breaks for employers and their workers last month the colorado office of economic development and international trade which oversees the program approved qmast llc into the program that company also works on the oil shale side of things it has a revolutionary and environmentally sound way of removing hydrocarbons from shale tar sands and conventional oil and gas reservoirs through a highpowered microwave system that company hopes to hire  employees almost immediately and up to  new workers over the next five years the third oil and gas company was one of the first to be approved for the program last year prostar geocorp provides geospacial software that allows oil and gas companies pipelines and utilities to better track all elements of their businesses the three companies have the potential of helping kickstart the extraction industry in the state which could make mesa county a focal point when it comes to hightech businesses for energy development creating economical ways to extract oil and gas from shale could lead to a resurgence in the industry for the entire western slope said kristi pollard executive director of the grand junction economic partnership which is actively recruiting companies for the program “it’s fantastic to see the energy industry growing again in mesa county” pollard said “the county has a long history in energy but we did lose many businesses in the past recession when energy prices dropped and jobs moved overseas the jumpstart tax credit program is not only bringing the energy business back to mesa county but creating a hub here for innovation and green technology in the energy space” the jumpstart program has been hailed in the grand valley and elsewhere in the state — there are only two other qualified regions in the state in montrose and las animas counties — as doing more to bring new jobs to regions of the state that haven’t had the kind of economic recovery as seen on the front range under it companies are exempt from paying state income taxes for four years — with an option for four more — and receive sales and use tax refunds of purchases of all tangible personal property but only if it is used exclusively in the jumpstart zone which in this case is all of mesa county the program also allows up to  employees in all of the companies approved in a zone to receive income tax credits on all their wages for four years with an option on another four to qualify businesses must offer a product or service unlike any other company in the zone and must partner with a college or university in the case of all seven of the new companies that school is colorado mesa university that last part is intended to help keep graduates from leaving the region by helping them get good highpaying jobs the other four companies approved for the program include colorado clean a manufacturer of biodegradable plastic kaart group which has developed a worldwide mapping program tsw analytical a forensics lab that hopes to break into the marijuanatracking industry and rebco enterprises which produces a soilless growing system that recycles water together the seven companies are expected to bring in more than  jobs by  pollard said comments commenting is not available in this channel entry

boundary the phase boundary describes the narrow band of material that is being heated by the microwave radiation at a time a common misconception with microwave energy is a limited depth of penetration at the frequency of a common microwave oven  ghz microwaves will penetrate into rock containing hydrocarbons and water only a few inches or centimeters the power is coupled into this area because of the high permittivity values for water and hydrocarbons once the water and hydrocarbons are removed then the permittivity for most types of rocks is very low so microwave energy couples into the adjacent rock beyond deplete rock region heats this region liquefies or vaporizes the hydrocarbons and then continues to migrate outward into the rock–hence the term migrating phase boundary based on careful measurements of the background permittivity of rock it is possible for the migrating phase boundary to reach distance of  meters or greater   october   mfischer qmast llc grand
