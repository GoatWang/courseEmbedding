andrews took a technology company public on the nasdaq exchange scott’s company was one of those dot com darlings and his backstage pass to wall street as the ceo of a public company provided him with a front row view of the inner workings of the stock market what he saw and experienced was eyeopening to say the least learn more about scott’s unique public company experiences in this bloomberg article “scott andrews cool under fire in the bb ground war” despite the company’s ultimate success on wall street scott was dumbfounded by the rapid and extraordinary swings in stock market prices – not just his own but that of companies like microsoft and intel too figure  historical price chart of intel corporation symbol intc “it was clear that the price action of the world’s greatest free market was massively and consistently distorted by hype conflicted analysts and simple human emotions though the investment bank’s analysts attempted to justify valuations using pe ratios and inflated projections it was clear that the real driver of irrational prices was the collective fear and greed of market participants – not fundamentals” scott’s view of wall street would never be the same after leaving the corporate world scott was faced with the challenge of protecting and growing his financial nest egg recognizing both the increasing risks and opportunities afforded by wall street’s inefficiencies and conflicts he became interested in selfdirected investment strategies he explains “my goal was to take advantage of the short term price swings while minimizing my capital’s exposure to the increasingly volatile and unpredictable markets as if the bursting of the dot com bubble was not enough the unimaginable nature of  really rattled my confidence and interest in buy and hold investing” with the help of a west point classmate david skowron who was also an active investor and programmer and original developer at sciquest they developed a backtesting software application and tested hundreds of strategies and ideas across multiple timeframes ultimately an intraday meanreversion strategy that traded the new york stock exchange open generated the most compelling and consistent results in scott’s words “day in and day out even the smartest investors make emotionalbased decisions at the open that are not in their best interest so we learned how to take advantage of those persistent tendencies for short term gains by trading the opening gap in fact the change in prices that occurs overnight often results in predictable behavior after the markets open and that is very counterintuitive” scott and david also realized that the sweet spot for turning their capital and minimizing market risk appeared to be in “placing a handful of quickhitting trades each month using the efficient leverage of futures to capture these intraday moves in high volume indices like the sp ” with nearly immediate success their strategy was validated and scott began trading and refining their opening gap strategies full time by  and on the cusp of the historic financial crisis scott started a blog called “the gap guy” – where he shared his research and trading plan prior to his execution with fellow traders scott’s live trading results and unusual transparency garnered a large following of other traders hungry for a quantitative strategy based on real trading edges that worked as the markets collapsed in  scott continued executing his plan and generated impressive returns using his historical analysis despite having never actively traded a bear market with growing demand scott founded master the gap mtg in  to teach selfdirected investors how to trade the opening gap using historical probabilities and futures by 0 master the gap had grown into a nicely profitable business when scott was encouraged by clients to expand the company and its research to cover more strategies and markets seeing the need for a trusted provider of high quality quantitative research and inspired by the idea of making an even bigger impact on the lives of individual investors many of whom were still trying to recover from the financial collapse of  scott was compelled to action eight weeks later he closed on a private round of equity financing from about 0 long term clients and renamed the company investiquant david joined the company soon thereafter to lead its technology and software development some of the company’s investors were also clients of rob hanna – a quantitative trader and innovative researcher he had long admired and with whom he had collaborated previously on various research projects the synergies of their approaches and skill sets were obvious to them and their mutual clients shortly after the financing rob agreed to merge his
