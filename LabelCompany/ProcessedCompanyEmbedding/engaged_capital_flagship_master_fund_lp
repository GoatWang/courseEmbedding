board of rentacenter engaged capital has lost confidence in rcii board’s willingness to fulfill its fiduciary duty and independently identify the optimal riskadjusted strategy to restore value to rcii shareholders reiterates call for rcii board to hire a financial advisor and immediately initiate a strategic alternatives process to evaluate a sale of the entire company engaged capital is concerned that the current board and management may take actions that would materially harm shareholders formally nominates mitchell e fadel former president and coo of rcii william k ken butler former coo of aan jeffrey j brown carol a mcfate and christopher b hetrick at the upcoming  annual meeting february    am eastern standard time newport beach califbusiness wireengaged capital llc an investment firm specializing in enhancing the value of small and midcap north american equities today sent a letter to the board of directors the “board” of rentacenter inc “rcii” nasdaqrcii formally nominating five highly qualified candidates for election to the board at the company’s upcoming  annual meeting of stockholders glenn w welling managing member of engaged capital llc commented “it is time for change at rcii the current board has presided over years of declining operating performance deteriorating financial results and a decimation of shareholder value despite years of underperformance these same directors refuse to act with a sense of urgency to explore all alternatives to create value for the owners of the company as one of the company’s largest shareholders we felt we had no choice but to present shareholders with an alternative slate of directors – directors who can help stabilize the business while also evaluating all strategic options available to the company we are pleased that we were able to attract two of the most experienced operators in the industry to our slate mitch fadel the former president and coo of rcii and ken butler the former coo of aan both of whom are highly qualified to replace mark speese rcii’s chairman interim ceo and cofounder who is up for election at this years meeting both have the capabilities and handson experience that is sorely missing in rcii’s boardroom today in addition carol mcfate jeff brown and chris hetrick bring decades of financial and transaction experience to the board that is paramount to assessing and taking action on the highest value option for the company’s future we believe it is time shareholders have directors who exhibit an understanding that their job is to act as the fiduciaries of all the company’s shareholders and not just those shares represented in the boardroom” the full text of the letter follows february   board of directorsrentacenter inc headquarters driveplano texas  members of the board engaged capital llc together with its affiliates “engaged capital” has a  economic interest in rentacenter inc “rcii” or the “company” making us one of the company’s largest shareholders as we have expressed numerous times we believe the rcii board of directors the “board” should immediately hire a financial advisor and initiate a strategic alternatives process to evaluate a sale of the entire company before attempting to pursue a risky public turnaround strategy the company’s over  decline in share price from its value above  a little over two years ago is a stark reminder of the need to benchmark the riskadjusted alternatives available to the company as we highlighted in our december   letter we believe the company could command a significant equity premium given the capital structure of the business for example based on yesterday’s closing price of  an acquisition price of  per share would represent a  premium for shareholders yet only a  premium to the company’s enterprise value based on our industry research we are confident there are numerous parties both strategic and financial that would have serious interest in acquiring the company given the history of shareholder value destruction poor operational execution weak corporate governance and reactive management change stubbornly committing to a standalone strategy when other options remain unexplored is simply unacceptable while we appreciate the open dialogue we have had to date with the board we are extremely disappointed by the company’s apparent refusal to address our concerns we believe the recent  share open market purchase by mark speese rcii’s chairman interim ceo and cofounder signals that the board is unlikely to proactively commence a strategic alternatives process in the near future as a consequence of this inaction we have lost confidence in the willingness of the board to fulfill its fiduciary duty and independently identify the optimal riskadjusted strategy to restore value to rcii shareholders our interactions with the board thus far suggest its behavior as a whole may reflect a personal loyalty to mr speese who owns only  of the company at the expense of rcii shareholders this is particularly concerning because we believe mr speese has a significant conflict of interest that could prevent rcii from maximizing value for its shareholders by pursuing a risky turnaround strategy that allows him to retain control of the company he cofounded and to maintain his leadership position mr speese clearly benefits in ways that shareholders whose primary interest is the company’s value do not benefit thus it is imperative for the board to not let the personal interests of one director stand in the way of value creation as we see no evidence that the incumbent board is willing to prioritize the interest of shareholders we believe the board must be reconstituted with new directors who will maintain an unquestionable allegiance to the true owners of the company – the shareholders furthermore we are extremely concerned that mr speese under the cover provided by a group of longtenured and apparently conflicted incumbent directors may materially harm shareholders if he acts to ensure his continued control of the company at any cost these actions include but are not limited to  failing to respond to incoming communications from parties expressing an interest in acquiring the company it is our understanding that mr speese may be employing this strategy so that he can either legitimately tell the board he has not received meaningful approaches from interested parties or to limit his interactions to parties that are in his personal best interest  failing to inform all members of the board of such inbound communications  restructuring the company’s debt in a way that transfers value from equity holders to debt holders effectively acting as an implicit poison pill eg onerous prepayment penalties for wouldbe acquirers mr speese is having discussions with lenders on refinancing alternatives which we are concerned could make rcii less valuable to an acquirer or make an acquisition of the company more difficult  selling a piece of the company while refusing to evaluate a sale of the entire company ultimately damaging the value of the remaining business  diluting current shareholders by placing equity or convertible debt with a “friendly” party to protect the status quo  negotiating a sale of the entire company to a “friendly” party as opposed to running a full and fair process  delaying a formal consideration of strategic alternatives to provide interim management more time to operate the business which despite their best efforts and based upon recent performance could result in a continued worsening of operational performance and a further decline in equity value we are hereby putting each and every director on notice we will use any and all resources at our disposal to ensure that the approximately  of shares outstanding not owned by mr speese are protected from further value destruction more specifically we call on rcii’s six independent directors michael j gade rishi garg jeffrey jackson jv lentell leonard h roberts and stephen l pepper to act objectively in these deliberations and to hold mr speese accountable you are being closely watched by us and the rest of rcii’s shareholder base to be clear we intend to hold each of you personally liable to the fullest extent permitted by law should you continue down a value destructive path and fail to act in the best interests of the company’s shareholders we believe that if you choose to do what is right for the company’s shareholders as is your duty the potential exists to create a significant amount of shareholder value by capturing a large percentage of the “fixed” value of rcii in a sale of the company given our interactions with the company thus far and the concerns highlighted above in this letter we feel we have been left with no choice but to seek significant board change given that five of seven incumbent directors have served on the board for over ten years and two of such directors including mr speese have served on the board for over twenty years we believe this board is stale and needs to be refreshed with new directors we are formally providing the board notice of our nomination of five highly qualified candidates for election to the board at the company’s upcoming  annual meeting of stockholders provided however that we intend to withdraw two of our nominees to the extent that only three seats remain up for election at the meeting we believe these individuals possess the financial operational and strategic acumen the board urgently needs our nominees are mitchell e fadel is currently selfemployed after
