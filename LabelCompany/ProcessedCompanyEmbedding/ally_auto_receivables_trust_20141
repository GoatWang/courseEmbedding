be hedged as such fitch has stressed the transaction structure using its aaa liborup stressed assumptions improved loss performance credit and residual losses on allys portfolio have declined significantly from the elevated levels seen in  and  this is a result of strong obligor credit quality and a recently solid wholesale used vehicle market leading to higher recovery rates and residual realization stable corporate health fitch rates ally financial the parent of ally the originator and servicer bb with a stable rating outlook fitch believes ally financial to be a capable originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio and prior securitizations evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects that increasing offlease vehicle rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to ally auto receivables trust sn to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays relatively little sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses showing downgrades of only one rating category even under fitchs severe  times base case loss scenario the transaction shows significantly more sensitivity to residual loss volatility although even under fitchs severe scenario the class a notes would be expected to retain an investment grade rating key rating drivers and
