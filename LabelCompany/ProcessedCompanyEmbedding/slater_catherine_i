catherine i slater senior vice president consumer packaging for international paper oversees ips consumer packaging group of roughly  employees who are broken into two divisions coated paperboard and foodservice coated paperboard is used in various applications for items such as packaged food cosmetics pharmaceuticals and alcohol and tobacco the foodservice segment produces paper cups food containers plates trays bowls and more “what i see as the opportunity is the dynamics of the consumer continuing to change” slater said “since this is one place  where we actually have more touch to the consumers you have to be really aware then of what is going on with delivery of food and how is that going to change what restaurants serve or how they serve or not with a continued increase of people buying stuff online how do we make sure that we are able to go to that channel and support the brand owners with their packaging all of these are just really big changes from what has historically been the dynamics of consumer packaging” mcdonald’s starbucks yum brands hilton and kroger are a few of ip’s customers and if you are curious when production starts to meet starbuck’s fallholiday cup demand the answer is now “you have to start early” slater said “for starbucks’ holiday things you start making those right now for the fall  if it is really cold — like there are some parts of the country having more cold than normal — that will be good for the hot cup” ip produces about  million tons of coated paperboard annually —  million tons in north america which accounts for a roughly  percent supply position and  tons in europe and russia foodservice makes  billion units of cups lids containers and plates every year roughly  percent of what coated paperboard produces goes to foodservice for use the remaining  percent is sold on the open market to companies for similar applications the consumer packaging segment accounts for  billion of ip’s total revenue or  percent while the consumer packaging division had a challenging first quarter in  going from operating profits of  million in q  to  million in q  — primarily due to mills being closed for maintenance — trends such as the foamtopaper conversion in the cup and food container segments are helping to drive industry growth slater said you cannot be in business for more than  years like ip has and use trees if you are not thinking about sustainability “there are a lot of things around recycle and sustainability” slater said “i think the message about what really is sustainable in the us depends on what part of the country you are in because some parts of the country are banning plastic — which is actually a positive for us — and then other parts of the country they don’t recycle at all … we have to have sustainable things to have the right to do business longterm and i think we have a good message” in north america there are two coated paperboard mills one in texarkana texas and one in augusta georgia as well as an extrusion facility in prosperity south carolina an extruder is what gives a material its coating the three foodservice plants are in shelbyville illinois kenton ohio and visalia california the foodservice plants outside north america are in colombia the united kingdom and china but consumer packaging’s work does not stop at the mills and plants the group also has a graphic design group strategically located in clemson south carolina to be near clemson university and the school’s sonoco institute of packaging design and graphics “they are extremely creative — a really fun group — and clemson actually is one of the few schools that teaches people how to do this kind of graphic design so we have sort of a hub right there” slater said “if a customer wants to have a certain design of something on a cup then they can take the design from a piece of paper and get it so you can actually put it on a round surface a flat thing trying to make it into a cup won’t look like what you think it does without some extra effort” consumer packaging also has a technical center in menomonee falls wisconsin ip’s consumer packaging product development center which was previously in loveland ohio recently consolidated to the wisconsin facility at the technical center — which slater described as an innovation research center — employees not only work to make cup machines faster and safer but scientists work to test different types of resins for lids new cup designs are also put through the “hold test” which is essentially how long can a cup be held that contains a hot liquid “those parts to me are the parts that are unique to ip — that we have innovation in this space — that it is not just make the products” slater said and when it comes to industry challenges slater said that is where opportunity lies “there is always going to be packaging people are going to drink coffee out of cups” slater said “certain customers only want plain iconic cups other people really want fancy designed new things  we are going to have to be more flexible to listen to what the customer wants and then be able to make a change for them quickly i would say that is a challenge but also an opportunity” ip business segments  industrial packaging — containerboard corrugated packaging north american recycling business global cellulose fibers — fluff pulp thrive
