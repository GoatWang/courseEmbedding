fartherthe ecb signaled that it would likely cut its bond buying in september  to €bmonth from €bmonthhopefully this article will help you grow your portfolio armour residential reit inc nysearr is an agency mortgage reit it invests in agency hybrid adjustable rate adjustable rate and fixed rate mbs agency rmbs especially fixedrate agency rmbs usually go down in value when interest rates go up and vice versa arr also includes since april   the assets of its subsidiary javelin these include fixed rate adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate agency rmbs and nonagency rmbs all of the above are managed externally by acm arr pays a roughly  annual dividend arr has fallen from share at about pm et on june   to about share at about am et on june   share or  this is worrisome the reason appears to be the last few days climb in the yield of the  year us treasury note one proxy for the climb in rates this climb does not seem likely to abate quickly although one can never tell investors may wish to dump this stock at least temporarily rather than take the chance of further losses the one month chart of the  year us treasury note yield is below the break upward has been sharp the close on june   was  as of this writing on june   the yield on the  year us treasury note is   bps in less than three full days this already seems to be taking on the auspices of an uptrend early in the morning on june   ecb president draghi spoke he signaled the ecb would cut back its bond purchases beginning in september  from €bmonth to €bmonth draghi also said that the ecb could adjust it monetary tools which are currently at subzero rates his tenor was very hawkish the ecb had only specified it would do qe until e this is leading some to speculate that another cut may be coming in november  that way the ecb could end its qe program at e with a final cut this rise in the  year us treasury note yield was likely helped along by janet yellens hawkish comments later on june   in london the above appears to be the start of a significant reversal in strategy by the ecb and in yields on us treasuries the boes carney followed those the next day with further hawkish statements the reaction of the uptrend in yields has been strong so far the low eu bond rates had been draggingkeeping their counterpart us bond rates down without as much downward pull from eu bonds us bond yields are likely to keep rising for a while as a proxy for weak eu bonds lets look at the  year italian sovereign bond yield it closed at  on june   as of this writing on june   it is at   bps in the last  days this is roughly double the move up in the  year us treasury note yield the law of supply and demand probably forces the  year us treasury note yield to rise one might postulate that the us yield has to rise to attract the same amount of eu investment interest that it had been attracting before the italian  year sovereign note yield rose notably the  year us treasury note yield only has to rise about half as much since the italian bond is viewed as much weaker it has been being held down by heavy ecb bond buying with this now thought to be lessening in september  the  year italian sovereign note yield is rising up to potential meet or exceed the yield on the  year us treasury note the  year us treasury note is thought by many investors to be a more stable investment when the ecb is not buying the weaker bonds of the piigs etc if the above trends continue they should lead to book value losses for us agency rmbs investments these investments will lose book value more quickly if yields rise quickly investors may want to cut back on some agency mreit investments or they may wish to sell out of them entirely at least for the near term quick rises in us treasury yields translate into lower values for rmbs rapid rises also tend to lead to wider basis spreads which usually means even greater losses in book value currently expected unwinding of some of the feds mbs assets later in  is also expected to lead to wider basis spreads lower book values of mbs with all of the above in mind it is appropriate to take a look at arrs positioning for such moves arrs portfolio as of may   is below the current total portfolio value is  million of this portfolio the tba securities and the total agency securities comprise  million or  this will be the part of the portfolio that will be most directly affected by the surge in yields on us treasuries especially the  year arr has  million in notional value of hedges these hedge  of the agency fixed rate assets and  of the fixed rate asset repurchase agreements for the rapid rises being incurred at the present time this seems likely to lead to large losses arr could adapt to the changes but historically arr has been very slow to respond to changes this likely means a very bad few months of losses ahead for arr if you compare the  year chart of the italian  year sovereign note yield to the  year chart of the us treasury note yield you should be able to see what the relative rates were like before qe in the eu the  year italian  year sovereign note yield chart is below the ecb launched its qe bond buying program of €bmonth on january   but many had been anticipating it for some time before that before the ecb had really started much help the yield on the  year italian sovereign note was roughly  in the chart below there is a long way up that the italian  year yield might potentially rise there is a lot of push upward that it could provide the us treasury  year yield the  year us treasury note yield chart is below notably the fed ended its qe bond buying at the end of october  the yield on the  year us treasury note may have meandered since the start of the ecbs bond buying program however the ecb had significant other qe programs before that the italian  year sovereign bond fell considerably as the result of the ecbs programs from above  and higher before that to some extent the italian bonds compete with the us bonds for investors if italian yields go up then us yields will likely follow to a lesser extent both economies will likely be weakened in terms of economic growth when the ecb is effectively backing the italian bonds by buying them consistently they tend to have lower yields without such backing they seem almost guaranteed to resume higher levels the italian banking system is still in a shambles even with qe in place for  years the italian economy grew only  in q  while this is better than negative growth it is not likely to sustain the italian economy without qe one effect of the ecbs qe low italian sovereign bond yields is that it tends to lower the cost of capital for italian businesses especially relative to german and french businesses this makes italian products more competitive with those other countries products this benefit will at least partially disappear once the ecb bond buying disappears then the italian economic growth will likely lessen that will in turn lead to further rises in yields on italian sovereign bonds ugh the overall weaker economic situation in the eu and the higher bond yields will likely lead to higher us treasury bond yields in the near term readers should remember that  year us treasury note yields fell from  on december   to   bps on june   in the face of two fed funds rate increases by the fomc  bps not including the december  raise the movement in opposite directions was counter intuitive the  bps move amounted to a counter intuitive move of almost  bps as a first adjustment one would expect the us treasury note yields to be able to rise back up to approximately the  level if not higher if there is trouble getting the raise of the us debt ceiling law passed in congress then the yield on the  year us treasury note could rise much further bond vigilantes shorters have a habit of making that happen they will be out in force if the us comes close to default on any of its debt the us debt clock shows t as the current us debt it will likely approach t by august  the us debt ceiling is t when the us debt reaches t that may bring the bond vigilantes out more will come out the closer the us gets to any defaults bond vigilantes could send rates even higher than anticipated from the above arguments emergency cuts to federal spending such as on the military would tend to depress us economic growth in q  in addition to the above the us congress has been working on repealing and replacing obamacare tax reform trade reform putting together a balanced budget for the next fiscal year and raising the us debt ceiling and likely other things not mentioned if the us congress manages to succeed at none of these tasks the yields on the us treasuries will likely go up due to disappointment and frustration with the federal government rating agencies could also threaten to lower the us debt rating such an action would likely lead to higher yields by itself some people will probably point to arrs duration number of  as a symbol of safety for arr however those that do will be fooling themselves the duration calculation only works when the curves involved roughly parallel themselves when you get rapid movements as we may see from the above the curves do not parallel themselves and the theory behind the duration calculation breaks down hence low duration will provide little or no protection for this case the leverage of x as of may   should lower the amount of losses still that figure includes the nonagency mbs which are much less highly leveraged hence the leverage of the agency mbs is significantly higher than x the two year chart of arr provides some technical direction for this tradeinvestment the above chart shows that the uptrend has been broken arr is now in a downtrend after its price line crossed its period sma on the way downward the first area of support is at about share the closing price on june   was share that price could fall easily to share if the above described scenario plays out it could fall farther still if there are significant problems enacting a raise of the debt ceiling andor the new budget for the coming fiscal year the sharemonth dividend is not enough to want to keep you in this stock over the next few months it would bring you only share over a three month period that will not adequately compensate you for the likely losses in book value and share value that may total  over the same period the estimated book value on may   was common share that number is lower already it seems sure to fall further over the next month or more due to the arguments in this article arr is a sell at this time at a later time investors who like the stock can decide if they want to buy it back note some of the fundamental
