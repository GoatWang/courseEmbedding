andor ladder logic to rapidly create custom applications we simplified the instruction set our function set is comprehensive easy to use and powerful no hunting for features vbuilder’s layout keeps the tools and information you need in plain view warnings and errors are presented in real time so there are no surprises at build tag based plcs are easier to use than address based ones but typically cost hundreds of dollars our entire line starting at  is tag based innovative features we’ve developed some great features to help you get things done quicker and more reliably subroutines break projects up into manageable chunks and allow program reuse objects isolate data and create logic components to greatly improve development efficiency maintainability and reliability linked subroutines specify that multiple subroutines should use the same objects maybe you’ve got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine and a process you want in another they can share an object so you don’t have to pass data between the two view your data and create operator controls with awesome free hmi we’re serious about delivering the easiest to use most productive plc software

instead of usb expansions are otherwise physically identical to branch main your sensors and actuators are branched out your plc should branch with them branchs unique structure beats backplane and brick systems at getting io where it’s need helping you run shorter wires and keep an organized system smarter io expansion units have full plc processing power and memory vbuilder’s power shines with branch put subroutines inside of io units to focus processing where it’s most needed debug your entire branch system as a unit no need to debug one processor at a time lets you view realtime data for

superstrong sided adhesive strip it bonds well with painted metals plastics and glass this stuff is used to attach skyscraper windows to their frames weve been impressed with its strength adhesive underside of ace and branch plcs but what if i want to attach it to a din rail screws or bolts you’re in luck we’ve got a great addon that helps you attach your plc to a mm din rail or  screws or bolts vmount same thing just upside down its got these  hooks ace or branch underside notice these slots ace and branch have four of the slots shown in the image above to the right two aren’t visible twist vmount onto your ace or branch to attach pick which of the  orientations works best for your project once attached to your ace or branch rest the topside on your din rail then press the bottom
