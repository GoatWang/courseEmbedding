equivalent through its  refineries bp processes  million barrels of crude oil per day it markets these products in  countries and through its network of  gas stations in  one of bps deepwater rigs in the gulf of mexico exploded killing  workers and spilling millions of gallons into the gulf of mexico the explosion and spill not only resulted in severe financial fines but also hurt the companys reputation under ceo robert dudley bp is undergoing a strategic change to pay for economic losses attributable to the explosion and improve its reputation company overview in the aftermath of the horizon disaster in the us gulf of mexico bps  earnings reflect both the extent of the disaster on bps financial strength as well as the implementation of a new global strategy in  bp reported a loss before interest and taxation of  billion compared to a profit of  billion in  while the earnings in every segment rose compared to  performance bp recorded a loss of  billion before interest and taxation in response to the us gulf oil spill profit from exploration and production rose to  billion from  billion in  partially due to higher crude oil prices due to improved margins over the year

in addition bp inked a multibillion deal with rosneft in early  business segments meow exploration and production  sales of  billion through its exploration and production segment bp engages in the search for undeveloped oil and gas reservoirs the development of reservoirs and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas from developed wells bp’s upstream activities include the exploration and extraction of crude oil and natural gas from wells in eight different countries in  bp reported sales from operations of  billion compared to  billion in  realizations on crude oil

billion compared with  million for  key trends and forces rosneft deal means shortterm costs but potential long term gain bps  billion share swap and jointventure deal with rosneft has the potential of producing substantial long term gains for the company and its russian partner however bp has to bear much of the shortterm costs since bp is exchanging  of its shares with  of rosnefts better rated stock the stock swap is likely to prove dilutive for bps earnings per share in addition bp has to pay for the early costs of developing oil and gas reserves in russia kara sea costs which are estimated at  billion however the blocks bprosneft plan on exploring have the potential of containing as much oil and gas as three times rosneft and bps  combined reserve base as a result bp has inked a deal with substantial growth opportunities in a sector made up by stateowned companies because the deal is longterm both political and financial risk remain largely unknown bp has a  stake in the venture which gives it less control over the ventures direction in addition the price and demand of oil have the potential of changing substantially in the longterm these factors are likely to play an important role in how profitable the venture becomes for bp as of february  the deal with rosneft is on hold due to a british court order won aar the russian shareholders who own half of the tnkbp project aar has charged that the deal with rosneft violates its exclusive agreement with them while there are several proposed resolutions including the sale of aars stake to bp or rosneft the legal troubles bp has faced with the tnkbp project illustrate the potential dangers surrounding largeinternational oil ventures because the tnkbp project involves a high degree of complexity in regards to ownernship control and international regulations legal problems have plagued the project for a long time and have the potential of impacting the projects operations as well as the operations of the rosneft deal russian energy czar igor sechin urged both bp and aar to come to an agreement and not let their legal battles hinder bps deal with rosneft to support his warnings sechin has threatened legal action against bp and its partners if they sabotaged the  billion deal damages from  offshore gulf explosion in april  a major fire on an oil rig in the gulf of mexico owned by bp and operated by transocean has the potential of hampering the development of offshore oil production and costing both companies millions in order to fix the situation although the exact cause has not been determined people at transocean believe the blaze is from an uncontrolled burst of oil and gas from the well the gulf of mexico produces  of the us oil output and is an important source of revenue for oil majors like bp in july  bp temporarily capped the oil spill using a pipe cork to control pressure oil is released through pipes up to ships which collect it as of july   bp plans to use this method until mud and cement are used to plug the well for good with spill capped successfully the bp outlined its  billion fund set aside for to pay for damages to companies organizations and individuals significantly impacted by the spill raise money for this fund bp plans to sell up to  billion of assets to apache apa in order to cover some of its liabilities in late july  tony hayward who has held the position of ceo since  announced that he plans to step down as ceo effective october  hayward was succeeded by bob dudley who previously ran the unit responsible for cleanup operations and compensation programs in the gulf of mexico while dudley has noted that cleaning up the gulf spill has the potential of being his first priority as ceo the company has also suggested that its nearfuture strategy incorporates several divestitures deemed noncore or risky the divestitures have the potential of raising cash to pay for bps  billion gulfrelief fund and reducing the companys risk exposure to another drilling accident as suggested in interviews and press releases bps strategy includes selling assets in places such as egypt and vietnam that bp bought in recent years to diversify its reserve base assets that have the highest potential for up for sale are those that bp deemed risky or noncore while it is still uncertain how much bp plans to sell it appears clear a focus on core assets and operations has the potential of becoming a principle strategy of a dudleyrun bp through joint ventures bp enters the oilsands production market in  and  bp inked several deals with oilsand production companies that have the potential of increasing bps exposure to that type of production since march  the deals struck by bp have typically followed a combination approach which basically slice the management of particular asset between the two companies while allowing both to receive revenue from them the result of these deals make it possible for both companies to retain a portfolio of assets without requiring that they have to run all of the assets bp announced in march  a  billion dollar deal with devon canada corporation the two companies agreed to work together on the kirby oilsands lease south of fort mcmurray alta however devon is designated as the project´s operator from the deal devons share of the oilsands production market as well as the size of bps offshore production operations have the potential of expanding bp has made similar deals involving oilsands production in  bp and husky energy inc struck a deal evenly splitting the ownership of bp´s refineries in the united states and husky´s oilsands leases however each company would operate their own side of the venture in march  bp agreed to make capital contributions to value creation inc a privately held production company in exchange for an operating stake in value creations oilsands leases to increase production bps moves operations abroad exposing the company to political risks as do other oil majors bp controls oil resources in countries around the world  of bps oil comes from north america and europe but the companys exploration and production segment has a strong incentive to push forward and explore in countries that are less politically stable by expanding around the globe bp has the potential of increasing its production capacity and reserve life at the end of  bp had invested  of its capital in organizations for economic cooperation and developmentoecd countries and its us and europe operations are the company’s largest  while its refining operations are located almost completely in the us and europe bp’s has exploration and production operations are located in  countries major development projects are located in the gulf of mexico azerbaijan algeria angola and parts of pacific asia although bp’s expanding global reach is capable of increasing its production capabilities political instability in many of these countries has the potential of damaging or destroying bp’s operations the company believes its operations most exposed to political risk are located in iran cuba syria and russia bp is vulnerable to natural disasters like the hurricane season the gulf of mexico where  of bps  production occured is prone to violent hurricanes during the last few months of summer these storms can damage drilling rigs and refineries and injure workers like most oil companies in the region bp reduces production during hurricane months still some storms can do real harm in  hurricane ike and gustav resulted in a significant amount of rig shut downs the impact of both hurricanes was a reduction equivalent to approximately mboe per day for  bps thunder horse operations completed in  are also susceptible to hurricane destruction
