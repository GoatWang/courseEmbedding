trusts mits can make an irrevocable election to apply these rules pursuant to the notice provided to unitholders on our website on  may  under section gca of the corporations act  cth as inserted by asic corporations attribution managed investment trusts instrument  platinum investment management limited acn    platinum has made modifications to the constitutions of the funds modifications to enable each fund to elect into the amit regime copies of the modifications are available free of charge by contacting investor services on    australia only    nz only    or emailing investplatinumcomau reasons for modifications the amit regime was established by the australian government to provide qualifying mits with the ability to benefit from improved flexibility and greater certainty in respect of their tax treatment platinum has decided to elect the funds into the amit regime with effect from  july  for reasons which include the following under the amit regime taxable income will be allocated to unitholders using the concept of “attribution” replacing the “present entitlement” model  please note that whilst there is a change in terminology under the amit regime in practice distributions to unitholders will continue to be allocated by platinum on a proportionate basis in line with platinum’s distribution policy the amit regime permits a more equitable allocation of any taxable gains that may have been realised in order to fund large redemption payments to redeeming unitholders  currently all unitholders receive a distribution related to these taxable gains but under the amit regime the gains may be “streamed” to redeeming unitholders platinum may be taxed on any taxable income of a fund that it fails to allocate to unitholders and may be liable for tax in respect of any tax offsets that have been over attributed to unitholders the amit regime provides a set of rules to deal with instances where amounts have been overdistributed or underdistributed  it is a common feature of managed investment schemes that the tax components in unitholders’ annual tax statements may sometimes require subsequent adjustment  under existing laws a new tax statement may need to be issued requiring unitholders to amend their tax returns  whilst the prospect of reissuing tax statements and amending unitholder tax returns for socalled “unders and overs” remains possible under amit this possibility will be reduced the amit rules will also provide a mechanism to prevent double taxation if the amount distributed by a fund is less than the taxable income attributed the existing platinum trust funds’ annual distribution and tax statements will be amended to comply with the new amit rules amma statement  the amma statement for a unitholder will continue to detail the unitholder’s share of attributable income but the format will change slightly  we will update our unitholder tax guide for the first distribution impacted by amit currently envisaged to be  june  effect of modifications the modifications in respect of the funds amend the funds’ constitutions to provide platinum with the power to make an irrevocable election for the funds to operate as amits including the ability to make a choice to treat each class of units as a separate amit where relevant recover from the funds in relation to any income tax liability incurred as a result of the funds being amits do all things necessary to operate the funds as amits and insert other provisions considered by platinum as being necessary or incidental to the funds complying with the amit

trusts mits can make an irrevocable election to apply these rules pursuant to the notice provided to unitholders on our website on  may  under section gca of the corporations act  cth as inserted by asic corporations attribution managed investment trusts instrument  platinum investment management limited acn    platinum has made modifications to the constitutions of the funds modifications to enable each fund to elect into the amit regime copies of the modifications are available free of charge by contacting investor services on    australia only    nz only    or emailing investplatinumcomau reasons for modifications the amit regime was established by the australian government to provide qualifying mits with the ability to benefit from improved flexibility and greater certainty in respect of their tax treatment platinum has decided to elect the funds into the amit regime with effect from  july  for reasons which include the following under the amit regime taxable income will be allocated to unitholders using the concept of “attribution” replacing the “present entitlement” model  please note that whilst there is a change in terminology under the amit regime in practice distributions to unitholders will continue to be allocated by platinum on a proportionate basis in line with platinum’s distribution policy the amit regime permits a more equitable allocation of any taxable gains that may have been realised in order to fund large redemption payments to redeeming unitholders  currently all unitholders receive a distribution related to these taxable gains but under the amit regime the gains may be “streamed” to redeeming unitholders platinum may be taxed on any taxable income of a fund that it fails to allocate to unitholders and may be liable for tax in respect of any tax offsets that have been over attributed to unitholders the amit regime provides a set of rules to deal with instances where amounts have been overdistributed or underdistributed  it is a common feature of managed investment schemes that the tax components in unitholders’ annual tax statements may sometimes require subsequent adjustment  under existing laws a new tax statement may need to be issued requiring unitholders to amend their tax returns  whilst the prospect of reissuing tax statements and amending unitholder tax returns for socalled “unders and overs” remains possible under amit this possibility will be reduced the amit rules will also provide a mechanism to prevent double taxation if the amount distributed by a fund is less than the taxable income attributed the existing platinum trust funds’ annual distribution and tax statements will be amended to comply with the new amit rules amma statement  the amma statement for a unitholder will continue to detail the unitholder’s share of attributable income but the format will change slightly  we will update our unitholder tax guide for the first distribution impacted by amit currently envisaged to be  june  effect of modifications the modifications in respect of the funds amend the funds’ constitutions to provide platinum with the power to make an irrevocable election for the funds to operate as amits including the ability to make a choice to treat each class of units as a separate amit where relevant recover from the funds in relation to any income tax liability incurred as a result of

out for doubledigit investment returns that rivaled some of the biggest names in the industryit turned out that those returns were too good to be true according to federal prosecutorsfederal agents on monday arrested mark nordlicht a founder and the chief investment officer of platinum and six others on charges related to a  billion fraud that led the firm to be operated “like a ponzi scheme” prosecutors said it is one of the largest such fraud cases since bernard l madoff’s investment firm unraveled in david levy the firm’s cochief investment officer was also among those arrested in the

federal district court in brooklyn the securities and exchange commission filed a parallel civil caseplatinum tapped prominent families and foundations within the orthodox jewish community in new york to fuel highstake bets on payday lenders oil companies and even the terminally ill but prosecutors said these investments and the firm’s performance were misrepresented by its executives ultimately

used to buy insurance payouts in their namesa company that platinum set up to make the investments was fined by the sec in january  “we definitely were exploiting a loophole but it was fully vetted by legal counsel” mr nordlicht said in an interview with bloomberg later that yearin other bets platinum misled both investors and auditors — sometimes brazenly in december  for example executives misrepresented to auditors the value of black elk energy an oil and gas company controlled by platinum valuing it at  million prosecutors said in fact there had been an explosion on a black elk platform in the gulf of mexico the month before that had caused the deaths of three workers injuries to other employees and an oil spill black elk no longer existsjeffrey shulse who worked at black elk and is named in the government’s indictment denied the charges “mr shulse’s indictment is a clear case of overreaching” said f andino reynal mr shulse’s lawyer adding that his client was “confident that once a jury has had a chance to hear all the facts it will exonerate him of any wrongdoing”lawyers for the defendants mr nordlicht daniel small uri landesman joseph mann and joseph san

precarious liquidity position a month later when an investor emailed to ask about the reliability of platinum’s reported performance figures mr landesman replied “the numbers are all kosher they have had verbal input every month”investors grew restless by march  the total amount they requested to withdraw from the firm exceeded  million eventually executives decided to pay some ahead of others prosecutors said“platinum partners purported to be a standardbearer in the hedge fund industry” said robert l capers the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york “in reality their returns were the result of the overvaluation of their largest assets” this inflation led to mr nordlicht and others “operating platinum like a ponzi scheme where they used loans and new investor funds to pay off existing investors” mr capers addedthe arrests on monday were part of an investigation among several government agencies including the federal bureau of investigation and the united states
