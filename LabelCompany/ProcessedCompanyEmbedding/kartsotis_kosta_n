prepared remarks before turning the call over to dennis secor our chief financial officer following his prepared remarks greg mckelvey our chief strategy and digital officer will join us for the qa with the first quarter of  behind us we are reporting financial results that are in line with our expectations coming into the quarter but more importantly we are pleased to report that we are on track to achieve our larger goal for the year of advancing our many strategic priorities specific to the first quarter as we expected results trailed last year reflecting the challenging environment for the traditional watch category foreign currency headwinds and last years relatively strong first quarter performance in the multibrand portfolio as pressure on the traditional watch category intensified during the quarter our wholesale partners both in the us and europe experienced a noticeable stepdown in sales trends from the last few quarters leading to conservative inventory management for the category in anticipation of technology products delivering later this year our experience during the first quarter has naturally impacted our outlook for the remainder of the year but it has also reinforced our commitment to investing in the strategies we are pursuing to drive future growth for the company dennis will provide you with more specific details around our results for the quarter but first i will update you on our progress towards the priorities we shared with you on the fourth quarter call and how they align with our overarching goal of delivering longterm sustainable growth and improved profitability brand building and innovation remain at the core of our business and we are laserfocused on innovation in design fashion and bringing new ideas to market as well as introducing new technology and functionality to our accessories during the quarter we continued to drive to extend our leadership position in our core business as we introduced new and updated assortments and invest in and grow our wearable technology initiative the team is working hard to integrate the misfit technology and platform across our portfolio of brands as we anticipate launching new wearable products in eight brands later this year across several product categories relative strength in fossil and skagen particularly in our international markets despite our challenge retail environment continues to give us confidence in our longterm strategy to grow our own brands and leverage our competitive and strategic advantages to return growth to our license portfolio we also continue to focus our efforts on advancing our digital and omnichannel capabilities and enhancing our crm initiatives efforts we believe will position us to drive future growth as our customer continues to evolve and change the way they shop so to review our strategic priorities first optimizing our portfolio of brands to extend our leadership position in watches while the traditional watch category continues to feel pressure from technology infused accessories and new product launches into the space we are introducing innovative designs and styles and bringing brands into our portfolio capable of driving future growth in our business with our longstanding brands like michael kors we are positioning the brand for improved performance and further international growth with the innovative product category expansion such as mens creating an elevated jewelry assortment and introducing an exciting connected accessories assortment later this year the addition of kate spade new york to our portfolio and its positive impact on our business continues to be a bright spot for us as we embark on the second year of the partnership we are excited about the potential for this brand now operating with the full complement of fossil group resources design product development and the ability to leverage our extensive global distribution network the team has also been hard at work over the last several months developing and producing the chaps line of watches that has just shipped into the market as with all of our launches we expect the brand to start small as we learn from the initial assortment and position the brand for longterm sustainable growth we believe this brand complements our existing brands in the portfolio allowing for new distribution and price points across a unique assortment so while we have plenty of headwinds making our business challenging at the moment we believe these newer brands combined with our strategic advantages and our ability to optimize our portfolio can help drive momentum in our business additionally the successful launch of our fossil q assortment and the acquisition and integration of misfits innovative technology and functionality further enhance our competitive advantage and leadership position in the watch category more on that in a moment and second igniting our own brands fossil and skagen and driving sustainable longterm growth we believe the longterm value for fossil group lies in our ability to be strong lifestyle brand builders and to leverage that strength to grow our licensed brands for that reason we will continue to invest in our own brands fossil and skagen and are encouraged with the progress made during the quarter with  constant currency growth in skagen led by product innovation and a solid performance in watches we continue to be excited about the opportunity this brand represents growth in each of our three regions demonstrates the global appeal of the brand fossils performance for the quarter was slightly better than our expectations given the strong quarter last year we are very encouraged by the growth in europe and asia as well as the strength in womens leathers a category we have been focused on improving adding innovative designs colors and unique assortments our brandbuilding activities social media efforts elevated websites and crm initiatives are all contributing to increased customer engagement enabling better interaction with our brands and we expect to continue to see results from these investments which leads me to our third priority for the year which is leading in digital through enhanced omnichannel and ecommerce capabilities these efforts are very much in support of growing our own brands as shopping patterns continue to evolve and mall traffic declines our investments in digital crm initiatives and ecommerce platforms should continue to support growth in fossil and skagen being in touch with our customers and providing them with an enjoyable online shopping experience and a platform to learn more about the brands and product offerings is essential for the future the insights we gain through crm efforts and creating deeper and more meaningful connections with our customers should drive repeat customers and support future growth in our brands the investments made in our omnichannel roadmap have proven to be beneficial resulting in doubledigit growth in the ecommerce channel through last year a trend that continued during the first quarter and finally building our presence in the connected accessories market this is a strategic priority that extends across our entire portfolio of brands and is topofmind for all of us at the moment technology is driving innovation in watches its the fashion trend of today and adding incremental functionality to watches and jewelry is a consumerdriven trend our ability to provide that functionality into greatlooking accessories with various lifestyle brands that customers can identify with is clearly a strategic advantage for us this was very clear to us at the baselworld watch show in switzerland earlier this spring in light of the current challenging environment for traditional watches we presented a roadmap to our partners and our customers around competing in this new environment providing innovative functionality in watches and jewelry and combining that with our design and branding expertise we will lead the way in this category the feedback from the trade and the media was very positive in this regard we are uniquely positioned to lead the convergence of style and technology given our design production and global distribution capabilities and now layering in the misfit technology platform provides an alternative to the customer adding additional functionality that will make the category more relevant to consumers at this event we announced the launch of connected devices in eight of our brands six of which will be new in  while each of these brands chaps diesel emporio armani kate spade new york michael kors and skagen will announce their own details regarding product launches we are looking forward to launches across multiple categories in time for the fourth quarter from our brand partners perspective they are extremely excited to be participating in this space given the demand for connected devices from their customers and are also looking forward to the incremental customer engagement the platform will provide them our wholesale partners are also excited about the opportunity to drive new customer to the stores and providing the technology devices their customers has been asking for beyond the licensed portfolio we remain very pleased with the performance of the fossil q assortment and the updated styles introduced following our q  product launch during the quarter the fossil q display smartwatch was again our topselling sku in all of our full price retail stores we are now working towards integrating the misfit platform into the fossil assortment just as we are with our licensed brands and rolling out new product in the second half of the year looking to the remainder of the year while our focus remains on the long term and executing against our strategic priorities we expect a challenging retail environment and pressure on the traditional watch category to persist given those pressures on the business we will continue to be mindful of our areas of investment and prudently manage our expense structure in order to direct our resources to the areas of greatest opportunity and pull back where we see less compelling opportunity for immediate impact as we did last year we will continue to evaluate our infrastructure and investment needs ensuring an efficient organizational structure and one that is wellequipped to compete in this evolving retail environment as retailers around the world remain cautious and are managing inventory tightly we believe the advantages of our nimble manufacturing and an operating platform have us well prepared to capitalize on opportunities as we head into the back half of the year we continue to expect  to be a year where we can see our momentum improve as we deliver our wearables product across our portfolio of brands and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year although the business is tough right now it is clear to us that our advantages of creativity scale and our portfolio of brands now combined with our technology platform puts us in position to increase share in the traditional watch business and also to capture share in the rapidly growing wearables business the combination of these two strategies we believe will dramatically improve our longterm sales growth and profitability and now i would like to turn the call over to dennis for more detail dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks kosta and good afternoon everyone our first quarter performance while below the prior year was in line with our expectations as we anniversaried a relatively strong performance in q  continued to face the challenging retail environment and navigated ongoing headwinds in the traditional watch category overall first quarter reported net sales decreased  to  million and on a constant currency basis declined  sales declined in each of our region which also reflects a relatively strong first quarter performance last year you may recall constant currency and comparable calendar results increased  last year with a very strong performance in europe and growth in most of our portfolio brands particularly our larger brands we continue to be encouraged by the performance of fossil and skagen particularly in light of the strong performance last year in both brands while fossils first quarter sales were flat compared to last years  first quarter growth skagen grew  compared to last year for the quarter we delivered diluted earnings per share of  compared to  last year the comparison to last years results was largely driven by lower sales given the challenging retail environment and pressure on the traditional watch category gross margin also declined as our pricing initiatives were offset by changes in foreign currency higher markdowns and more promotional activity in outlets than we had planned part of our effort to stimulate sales the sales and margin headwinds were partially offset by a decrease in infrastructure expenses and we had fewer gains on foreign currency contracts compared to last year from a sales perspective the fossil brand was flat to last year in constant dollars we were particularly encouraged with growth in the quarter for the leathers category led by womens handbags growth in leathers was offset by a decline in jewelry and a slight decline in watches in the americas sales growth in europe and asia was offset by a decline in the americas globally our retail stores delivered a  comp decline with a strong comp in europe partially offsetting declines in the americas and asia in our full price stores our marketing message and the buzz around fossil q are helping to drive traffic to our stores and drove a positive comp our performance was different in our outlet stores where promotional activity drove improved conversion but was not able to offset the decline in traffic skagen sales grew  in constant dollars with growth across all three categories led by watches and growth in each region in constant dollars our multibrand watch portfolio declined  compared to last year as the traditional watch category continues to be challenged from technologyenabled devices wholesale sellthroughs declined and our wholesale partners have reacted with tighter buys putting pressure on our top line while we continue to benefit from the addition of newer brands to the portfolio the majority of the brands in the portfolio declined compared to last year and larger brands in the portfolio continue to be hindered by strong historical growth in the americas first quarter reported sales decreased  to  million a  constant dollar decrease the decrease was driven by watches with jewelry and leathers also contributing to the decline across brands we continued to benefit from the addition of kate spade new york to the portfolio and constant dollar sales increases for armani were offset by declines in nearly all of the brands in the portfolio within the region our full price stores performed well and delivered positive comps with strong performances in wearables and womens handbags this strong performance was more than offset with weaker outlet sales where traffic continues to be down constant currency growth in canada and mexico was offset by a decline in the united states constant dollar wholesale sales declined during the quarter largely driven by further pressure on the watch category in us department stores after three consecutive quarters of fairly stable watch sellthrough headwinds we observed a significant stepdown in that trend that sustained itself throughout the first quarter affecting most of our portfolio brands our business also softened in latin america particularly in travel retail where sales fell well short of expectations we did shift some though not all sales to offprice partners which obviously impacted both sales and our margins in europe reported sales decreased  to  million constant dollar sales decreased  with a decline in watches and jewelry partially offset by an increase in leathers within the region growth in fossil and skagen was offset by a decline in the licensed portfolio by country modest constant currency growth in france and germany was offset by a decline in the uk and in our distributor markets which includes the middle east and russia similar to what we experienced in the us the data we received from many of our wholesale partners in europe showed a significant decline in sellthroughs the retail channel grew in the quarter supported by a strong comp store sales increase with promotional activity in outlet stores driving improved conversion despite ongoing traffic declines full price stores also delivered positive comps in the quarter in asia reported sales decreased  to  million while constant dollar sales decreased  the decrease was driven by watches and jewelry partially offset by modest growth in leathers solid growth in india was offset by declines in most markets in the region particularly hong kong and china where our business continues to be challenging growth in fossil and skagen and the addition of kate spade new york were offset by declines in most of the other brands in the portfolio comp store sales declined slightly in the region in the quarter gross profit decreased to  million and gross margin declined  basis points to  roughly  of which was related to the stronger us dollar our gross margin rate was lower than we expected coming into the quarter given increased markdowns and promotional activities in our outlet stores a higher level offprice sales compared to last year and an increased mix towards leathers a lowermargin product contributed to the rate decline and was partially offset by our pricing initiatives first quarter operating expenses decreased  or  million to  million compared to  million last year a reduction in infrastructure costs and lower store expenses were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with misfit including roughly  million in purchase accounting costs and strategic marketing investments excluding the favorable impact of currency and the  million in restructuring costs that occurred in  expenses increased  our first quarter reported operating expense rate was  compared to  last year operating income decreased to  million including a  million unfavorable currency impact and operating margin decreased to  including a  basis point headwind from currency interest expense increased to  million given our higher debt levels first quarter other income decreased  million to  million due to lower gains on foreign currency contracts compared to the prior year our effective income tax rate for the quarter was  compared to last years  first quarter net income decreased to  million due to lower operating income given the sales and gross margin decline as well as a reduction in other income due to the prior year benefit from hedging activity now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet for the quarter we generated operating cash flow of  million and drew down a net  million on our revolver we invested  million in capex and  million in our share repurchase program and expect share repurchases this year will be minimal we ended the quarter with roughly  million in cash compared to  million last year and debt of  million compared to  million a year ago we ended the quarter with inventory of  million in line with last year we believe the composition of our inventory is in good shape with increases in newly launched product categories and brands and significant reductions in traditional watches and jewelry accounts receivable decreased by  to  million and wholesale dsos were flat to the prior year depreciation and amortization expense totaled  million for the first quarter moving on to our outlook let me provide an update on trends in the business and how we expect that they will impact our operating results this year first our strategic initiatives to drive growth in the fossil brand supported by our digital investments are working they began delivering results last year and we believe will continue into this year we are seeing momentum in the brand including positive comps in our full price stores and a solid online performance second our confidence has been bolstered by a strong performance in our wearables assortment that began with the product launch in the fourth quarter and continued into this year we expect to build on that momentum as we quickly develop more connected products and launch more brands incorporating our misfit platform we remain extremely bullish on our ability to gain share in the fastgrowing wearables market as we leverage our unique position to fuse technology with brands and fashion we are on track to deliver a wide assortment of new products that will be available in the second half of this year so with one quarter behind us we believe those initiatives remain on track third is the performance of the traditional watch business and the wholesale channel which is certainly the biggest change in our business as we exited  we expected continued challenges in the traditional watch category though based on our fourth quarter performance and the wholesale sellthrough trends our partners reporting for some time we anticipated some level of stabilization overall for  we expected top line headwinds would persist in the first half with the opportunity to return to growth in the second half as we launched more connected products that stabilization in the traditional watch category and wholesale does not appear to be holding during the first quarter the data we received from our wholesale partners indicated a meaningful sustained deceleration in wholesale sellthroughs not only in the united states but also with wholesale partners in europe mall traffic remains difficult and many of our wholesale partners have announced transitions in their own businesses our latin america business also did not perform as we had anticipated with the lack of visibility in this part of our business we believe it is prudent to adjust our outlook to reflect these new trends and to provide for further wholesale softening we are adjusting our forward inventory buys and expect as we did in the first quarter to rely more heavily on offprice partners to manage inventory levels appropriately in the first quarter we also invested more in promotions in order to drive sales in our european outlet stores and expect that we will maintain this level of activity to drive business in those stores given those factors we expect these intensified headwinds will result in both lower sales for the year and tighter gross margins with the wholesale sales softness representing by far the most significant driver of the change as we manage our wholesale traditional watch business in  and anticipating lower sales now than we had originally planned we have once again reviewed our infrastructure and investment plan and identified areas where we can reduce and delay we will continue to look at opportunities to optimize our overhead structure for the longer term in addition we have reevaluated and reprioritized our market investments for the year reducing investments where we dont believe we will see immediate returns by continuing to invest in initiatives that are already working like fossil or digital initiatives and supporting our second half wearables launches therefore for the full year we now expect constant dollar revenues to decline between  and  which includes a  basis point headwind due to currency our biggest obstacle this year to quarterly growth will be leveraging our wearables launches offset the headwinds in our wholesale traditional watch business we expect gross margins to decline this year given an anticipated increase in outlet promotions as well as a greater reliance on offprice partners our margins will be further compressed due to the lingering impact of the strong us dollar with the further reduction to expenses we are now planning that our full year operating expenses will be flat to slightly down this year we are planning higher marketing investments to support strategic initiatives and our wearable technology infrastructure including the addition of misfit expenses and the related purchase accounting costs these increases will roughly offset a reduction in our base infrastructure costs as well as the impact of last years restructuring charges this will result in an overall expense rate that is higher than last year given the decline in sales of traditional watches therefore for the full year we now expect reported operating margin in the range between  and  this includes about a basispoint decline due to the impact of currencies now we expect earnings per share in the range between  and  per share and this range reflects the challenges we are facing with forward visibility the currency environment has not changed materially from our initial guidance so we are still expecting significant translation and margin headwinds as well as far fewer net currency contract gains we now estimate the net impact of those items is roughly  per share we continue to expect that this years results will be negatively impacted by  per share resulting from the amortization of misfit intangibles and contingent equity grants and the yearoveryear comparison will continue to be impacted by last years foreign tax credit resulting in a  eps headwind this year as well we continue to plan this year with a  tax rate for the second quarter we are planning a reported sales decline between  and  including about a  basis point headwind due to currencies we are planning with lower gross margins and expect increases in our strategic marketing funding and wearables will slightly offset declines in our base infrastructure spending we expect reported operating margin between  and  which includes a  basis point currency headwind and we expect eps in the range between breakeven and  per share we continue to plan capex in the range between  million and  million and now well open the call up to your questions and to be fair to everyone please ask only single part questions if you have more questions please requeue after others have asked theirs eric m cerny  investor relations contact thank you good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us and welcome to fossil groups first questionandanswer session operator thank you well go to omar saad with evercore omar saad  evercore isi thanks good afternoon was hoping you could help us understand the back half and how youre thinking about the back half revenues guidance and the change in trend i understand the traditional watch business has really dropped off in the first quarter traditional wholesale watch business but how do you think about integrating all the new products you have coming into the market both from the wearables side and the tech side but also from the fashion side my understanding was you guys have a lot of new stuff coming into the market are you getting feedback from your retail channels that they dont want to order into those areas strongly or is it really waitandsee from the retail accounts like help me understand why – i understand why maybe sales are slower now last – in q q but with all the newness coming why dont you expect sales to rebound in the second half constant currency thanks dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer well let me take maybe a deeper dive into guidance and then we can fill in with some of the discussion about wearables for the back half but just to sort of doubleclick on how were seeing the year and just to echo what we said first the change in guidance is virtually all related to what we saw in the wholesale watch business which reflects both the stepdown in sellthroughs that the channel reported to us in the quarter and frankly to reflect the further risk in a channel where our visibility is very limited right now and you remember back to the last fourth quarter we guided to a pretty wide range that accommodated a big stepdown at the time even though sellthroughs had been fairly stable for the prior couple quarters and that was principally to reflect our lack of visibility and fortunately in the fourth quarter we didnt see that stepdown and our performance came in near the top of the range so weve maintained that same approach coming into  guiding to a pretty wide range with wholesale sellthroughs that then actually been pretty stable for three quarters so whats changed is unlike the fourth quarter in the first quarter that just passed that reported we did see that wholesale stepdown and it was substantial larger than we had seen before and it was pretty much across the board with the data we receive from partners reported sellthrough declines here in the united states and europe and as we mentioned earlier latin america where market intel is pretty challenging that business fell well short of our sales plans and even external sources like npd also repeated a very significant stepdown from q to q so where that leaves us is the top of our guidance now generally reflects the current trends that were seeing and the low end reflects that further stepdown to account for lack of visibility we also may be able to manage and shift some sales further to offprice that would impact obviously our margins and we reflected in our guidance the impact of further expense cuts that weve made that includes cutting some marketing investments in areas of business that really arent paying off right now what hasnt changed and this is really what supports the growth in the back half is our confidence in fossil and our confidence in wearables the marketing buzz and the buzz around fossil q as we said just a minute ago weve nearly eliminated traffic headwinds in our us full price stores weve got positive comps so we are continuing to invest behind that and we think that can drive performance in the back half of the year we have confidence in the products that were bringing to market and believe that the customer is there you heard what kosta said just a minute ago talking about basel and the excitement around our strategy for the category so were going to continue to invest in that kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer so omar youre right on the product side we are launching a lot of wearables back half of the year everything looks great looks very exciting the stores are really excited to change their departments in addition to that as you mentioned we are putting into market a lot of new innovative materials ideas shapes et cetera were seeing a strong response to that across the platforms were adding more of it in the second quarter i think when times get tough like this innovation is always a driver and we expect thatll be continuing but just you look at our entire analytics and our data right now we seem to be in a lot of turbulence in terms of the traditional watch business and we feel its prudent to give the guidance weve given but we think the combination of wearables and all the new product that at some point this is going to turn around and be a pretty exciting prospect for us operator and our next question comes from ike boruchow with wells fargo ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc hi everyone thanks for taking my question kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer sure ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc i guess in terms of your own connected technology products that you plan on rolling out in the back half of the year can you just help us understand maybe what level of commitment your department store partners have discussed with you i mean im just trying to understand at this time how are you internally planning the launch given its a brand new category that you guys have never sold through and the fact that they seem to be buying the traditional watch business much more cautiously today thanks kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer well first of all the stores obviously have seen their watch business decline so if you go back seven years ago the watch department is very much larger than it was then its grown in multiples it is actually with the decline in the watch business probably come down a bit obviously in productivity but still one of the most productive areas of the store and the stores are actually very excited theres so much consumer interest in wearables its very topofmind it brings a younger customer in their store theres a bunch of excitement around it we think that theres an opportunity to change the entire watch department from a typical watch department to a wearable technology department obviously millennials overspend on technology so its very exciting so we are in the process of getting plans in place for the back half of the year in all the brands were launching especially fossil and kors getting pointofsale visual presentation fixturing in place getting a lot of marketing pr theres probably going to be tv campaigns on both brands were getting everything in position there are commitments weve made in products but were going to be launching in the third quarter this year there is a potential even for us to do a reorder for holiday we already know that probably about  of wearables are sold in the month of december so it could be an additional amount of commitment there so to answer your question about commitments the numbers are changing almost every week and theres a lot of excitement and were putting plans in place to have a strong execution the one thing thats clear is just from our launch at basel we got more press and page views than anything weve ever done before and we are seeing already just looking at numbers purchase intent on fossil smartwatches and its still a very small business for us it shows to be a pretty significant number and we dont have a lot of product in the market yet so all our analytics look strong with the customers are excited about it and the actual commitment from them and our numbers are moving every week gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer id add one other thing to that which is although founder which is our display smartwatch for fossil was our number one selling sku and has been so were very bullish on that category but one of the most exciting things coming out of basel was the reception we got from customers from integrating technology from misfit into the existing watch business as well so were getting – and were already on generation two and three in development of these things but the ability to have added functionality like time that automatically changes with time zone changes or daylight savings press a button and have a wheresmyphone feature these are all added value to existing watches that is driving a lot of customer interest that is beyond what we even expected when we showed people at basel so really bullish on all three categories those two plus trackers operator thank you well now hear from dorothy lakner with topeka capital markets dorothy senghas lakner  topeka capital markets thanks everyone and good afternoon just wanted to i mean i dont want to beat the dead horse here but just to go back to what youre hearing from your wholesale partners you did see the significant stepdown in traditional watches are they stepping up to the plate on the new watches on the wearables are you seeing some commitment there or is there just a lot of reticence around the entire category how confident are you in seeing this growth in the second half of the year from all that youre doing on the wearables side kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer a couple of things first of all id say overall i think in the first quarter this year there has been a stepdown just in overall traffic and consumer activity so thats one thing dorothy senghas lakner  topeka capital markets right right kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer in addition to that i think especially in watches i mean we attribute this really to all the press and pr and excitement around wearables i think there seems to be somewhat of a lack of interest in watches relative to last year we actually had a pretty good quarter first quarter last year in watches i think another piece of this is the stores saw in the fourth quarter relatively slower sellthroughs on watches so they didnt fill back in in the first quarter as they normally would have and typically that means as you know the larger doors dont get filled back in and they may impact their sales so it has a multiplier effect in there so i think theres just kind of a malaise in watches our biggest objective in all this technology stuff is really to disrupt the watch business we think as greg mentioned to put additional functionality in traditional watches and as weve said before our mission is to eventually we want to put connectivity in every watch we make without adding a lot of additional to the retail price so were – with the misfit technology and all of our engineers et cetera the mission is really to take the existing watch business and add functionality innovation and connectivity and make that category more relevant to consumers that increasingly overspend on technology we think thats a very exciting prospect and largely millennials have not worn watches because they grew up with smartphones so just taking the existing core business and all the activities weve got without smart analog movement which is just a regular analog watch great looking watch thats heavily designed and branded and its got connectivity in it with not a lot of additional price we think thats going to make the category very strong we think well gain share well have differentiation and we think thats a very strong prospect for the traditional watch business having said that thats not going to change totally this year were going to be launching in i think eight brands the smart analog movement thats not going to penetrate the overall assortments to a large degree until the next couple years so this is starting off pretty small in addition to that traditional watch business were launching of course trackers in many brands which we think can be a new accessories business so imagine trackers as connected jewelry with branded storytelling and engagement with different brands we think it can be – just like a handbag business or something else it can be a branded accessories business and were going to add design color branding emotional attachment et cetera to that category and then the third piece is the smartwatch which is a digital display android watch and if you just look at the wearable technology the tracker and the display watch the projections are from research groups like idc is that in  thats a  billion business that we are going to participate in i think they mentioned that in  theres going to be  million smartwatches sold and we are – weve got our toe in the sand now and weve got a lot of activities coming and were going to participate in that in a very large way so we feel like theres two things were going to disrupt the existing watch business and take a bigger share and make it more relevant and then were going to participate in a strong way bringing branding design our distribution power and all of our resources to bear on that wearable technology market and make it a fashionable business and we think its a very exciting prospect to us to add that much more addressable market to our company and all these are adjacent businesses with the misfit technology and our capabilities now were in a unique position to capture a much larger market operator thank you our next question will come from oliver chen with cowen  co cecile origenes  cowen  co llc hi this is cecile origenes for oliver chen thank you for taking my question i actually wanted to just ask you a little bit more questions about your crm and digital initiatives its very encouraging to see some of the – or hear some of the positive results youre seeing from your investments so far in that area could you just speak to some of the opportunities that remain in fy  and what youre most excited about gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer yeah this is greg so were actually getting just in the last couple months a lot more highlights from the successes that we had in q so although q this year  wasnt a big stepup in marketing for the fossil brand the highlights – some of the highlights that we saw in q were a very very good roi significant increase yearonyear very strong millennial response so not to bringing a lot of new customers into the business that are not just wearablesdriven but are actually coming in and buying wearables plus other products saw not just brand interest growing across social channels and search channels but omnichannel traffic and thats measured by our own ecomm channels our own directtoconsumer channels and what were seeing in traffic and searches broadly so really in all channels were seeing increasing interest in fossil brand so thats where as we look for the back half of this year were going to continue to finetune the mix and continue to lean in on the vehicles that have been working todate and then plus up a significant amount of spend against the wearables launch in particular so that were getting the right push on the brand into the directtoconsumer channel on the products that are working operator well continue on to ed yruma with keybanc capital markets edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets hi good afternoon and thanks for taking my question i guess on the department store front anecdotally it seems like some department stores are pulling out of one of your major brands has that been impactful to your numbers and are you expecting that and then i guess as a followup to that do you think that theyre selling down in anticipation of wearables or do you think theyre selling down in anticipation to lower sellthrough thank you kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer well i think its a combination of factors traffic is off in general and the watch category is slowing down and the other thing to consider and weve talked about this before is that during the fourth quarter its a relatively small time of the year for watches so theres not a huge amount of – theres not a lot of companies out there trying to fill back into watches right away because the sellthrough is relatively slow so all those things i think are playing into that and then the stores are obviously very excited about wearables and there is going to be a conversion over the next couple of years from traditional watches adding more technology to them so there may be some conservatism on inventory from that regard as well operator thank you erinn murphy with piper jaffray your line is open christof r fischer  piper jaffray  co broker hey good evening this is christof fischer on for erinn so i was wondering if youd speak a bit more about the michael kors brand and what role you see it playing in your portfolio maybe any type of information on kind of the performance during the quarter and what do you see as the key drivers going forward for the brands performance thanks kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer while we were – last year i think in the first quarter we had a very strong watch business and kors was a big part of that and we had over the last couple years seen very significant growth the business is very very large as you can imagine so weve seen a moderation of that but were moving forward i think probably the most exciting thing for kors this year is a couple of things one is were going to have a huge launch i mean we – they actually had a press conference in our basel fair and out of that press conference there was about  billion page views from it the consumer interest on the kors smartwatches very significant theres going to be very significant amount of activities around when that launches so we think thats going to be very exciting we also – as we mentioned we have been changing the product line quite a lot it looks a lot different were seeing a lot of new ideas sellthrough in there and we think that thats going to improve over time we also still have a relatively large opportunity both in mens and in jewelry were continuing to build shopinshops one thing that even though the business has come down some its still by far the most productive watch brand that we have and its one of the most productive in the world just in terms of sales per square foot and of course asia is just getting started its still a relatively small business the brand is getting a lot of traction there and in all of those markets especially asia the smartwatch is going to be a big player because theres a lot of interest over there so all in all i think we still have a lot of growth ahead of us longterm in the kors brand christof r fischer  piper jaffray  co broker great thank you operator and well go on to simeon siegel with nomura simeon a siegel  nomura securities international inc thanks good afternoon kosta just given the wholesale commentary any thoughts on just how large that north american business should be in your opinion looking further out and then dennis maybe just a similar question around margins what is the right ebit margin for your business can you talk about the moving pieces be it product geography channel dynamics anything within there and then how are connected margins versus traditional watches thanks kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer well i think as we mentioned the watch business globally is about  billion wearable technologies is expected to be an additional  billion in  were going to – we think through this process we can gain share in the traditional watch business with all our activities in addition to that were going to capture a share in the wearables business so to us theres no reason why we shouldnt have a much larger wholesale business in the united states there will be – with our activities with the misfit brand and other items there will be additional distribution for us as well and this is going to put is in the ce channel and other distribution and obviously distribution channels are changing globally i think the one thing thats clear is that wearable technology is very much skewed towards ecomm and this is going to open up a lot of doors for us globally it could be actually a catalyst for us not only in the united states but in asia where its difficult to penetrate the asian market especially china with shopinshops and concessions but ecomm may be the answer and wearable technology may be the catalyst so a lot of great stuff out there we do think that were going to have a much larger wholesale business in the us though dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah in terms of the margin structure last call we went through this quite a bit but nothing really fundamentally has changed and we feel that and said before that  is an inflection as we go through this transition and theres headwinds in the wholesale business and weve got growth opportunities and the steepness of that inflection point is part of whats masked right now with the lack of visibility but we still see growth drivers coming out in the back half of this year and beyond that can accelerate as we bring more brands onto the platform and even add new brands the biggest risk remains how we can replace any weakness in the traditional watch business with these new growth drivers in terms of operating margins in gross margins we see some nearterm dilution because wearables margins right now are a little tighter than the traditional business but theres opportunities to offset those with scale and innovation and then as weve proven to ourselves we think theres opportunities for additional aur when our bestselling product in the stores right now is coming at a very substantial price tag that bodes well for our ability to add aur as we add features into our products we said and our strategy remains that as we come out of this year that we would expect to moderate weve had some headwinds as weve been investing in marketing and our goal going forward is to invest more consistently with our top line were getting good returns on those investments now the biggest opportunity for us in terms of margin expansion is on the overall structure which we will always every year as we look at our plans we look to see what we think revenues could be and then size that appropriately but as we look forward largely everything that we need to run this business is already in place to any material extent so that remains an opportunity for us to leverage probably the one big factor that remains to be solved is the impact of currencies over the last two years based on our numbers right now currencies have taken about almost four full points of operating margin and thats going to be difficult to get back quickly absent a weakening of the us dollar operator thank you our next question comes from rick patel with stephens rick patel  stephens inc thank you good afternoon everyone there seems to be a lot of excitement about the features your wearables will have thanks to misfit can you give us some examples of the types of things that will change are there features that can be improved upon that consumers would take notice of and as you leverage these new capabilities will that change your relationships with google and intel thank you gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer sure ill address first the adding technology to existing watches because i think we sell  million watches today all they do primarily is tell time and now weve got the capabilities to add a lot of features to a product without compromising the style the branding and all the reasons people purchase these products and love these products today so some of the features youll see this fall the time will be automatically updated with time zone changes or daylight savings youll have a feature we call link which is the ability to control the internet of things around you off of your device so youll have a push button on your watch youll be able to push it and it will ring your phone so its a wheresmyphone feature were getting very strong initial feedback from our initial customer research on even that as a very valuable feature in addition activity tracking sleep smart notifications these are all things that are valueadds to the existing products we have today a substantial upgrade and also as dennis mentioned a significant increase in average unit retail over time we believe that the cost of get – think of that as a new type of watch movement the cost of that will get closer and closer to a quartz movement and when that happens there is no reason that we wont be able to add those features to literally every watch we make and now weve got the entire what we call software stack the cloud and the cloud ecosystem and the apps the whole app infrastructure to be able to not only bring those products to market successfully but scale them across the breadth of our branded portfolio across most of the countries were in and across all the languages so this year itll be eight brands  countries  languages and thats what the misfit acquisition allows us to bring to market on smartwatches which is effectively the apple watch competitive set we are committed to the google android wear operating system so the michael kors access watch and the fossil q watches and the lines that are coming out this year those will always continue to be based on the google android wear operating system we are continuing to be very bullish around where google is taking that operating system and have seen some of what theyre bringing to market later in the year in operating system upgrades and its just going to continue to significantly advance in capabilities google will take the lead on announcing exactly the functionality that is being enhanced there though operator thank you our next question comes from lindsay drucker mann lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co thanks good evening guys kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer hi lindsay drucker mann  goldman sachs  co i wanted to ask again on the us wholesale business could you help us understand first of all your channel mix department stores and any other buckets so how much of the us wholesale business is in department stores and then as you talked about that sort of step function change in sellthrough could you help give us some specifics on maybe order of magnitude what sellthrough was running in the preceding three quarters and what its running now we heard from you in midfeb and did that dynamic happen sort of later in feb and into march or was it already underway and then just lastly as i square your earnings guidance to back half of the year the implied revenue guidance i think is up  to  and i wanted to understand what sort of growth or how you were thinking about the trend for the americas in the context of sort of the back half of the year thanks dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer just quickly the makeup of the american business us department stores is probably the largest part of that you also have a significant number of boutiques so some of our brands that have their own stores they can be significant businesses and customers for us latin america is a big business for us as well all wrapped up in the americas region as is canada and mexico so theres a lot of components that make up that business in terms of the second quarter or the back second half of the year what weve said about in the guidance is that the top you should think about the top end of the guidance generally reflecting the current trends that were seeing right now and weve stretched that to accommodate in the lower end some further deterioration just given lack of visibility that we had in terms of what we saw in the channel the stepdown in the business was fairly consistent throughout the quarter you get reads throughout different parts of the business different times and theres differentiations in terms of the sophistication of the channel so it really pulls together throughout the quarter but in some parts of the business the stepdown was pretty quick and significantly theres always some choppiness to the data but the significant thing is that it was sustained throughout the entire quarter in a lot of places operator thank you our next question comes from anna andreeva with oppenheimer anna andreeva  oppenheimer  co inc broker great thanks good afternoon and thanks for taking our questions kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer sure anna andreeva  oppenheimer  co inc broker i guess we were curious on either misfit or fossil wearables dollar or unit sales in q how did that number come in versus expectations just trying to assess the opportunity for  as you have the additional launches in the back half and we noticed you took aur down to i think  on the activity trackers i guess what drove that decision and any additional tweaks we should expect with pricing thanks dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so let me just start with the numbers i mean were not separately disclosing the misfit numbers or the fossil wearables we can tell you right now the numbers are still fairly modest for both of those brands the bigger opportunity comes as we bring more brands into the back half of the year gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer yeah and on price point we think the tracker business is clearly having a lot of unit sales across multiple channels with the success of some of the competitors that are out that we think as we bring fashion and the featurerich functionality that misfit brings us at a killer price point so that  to  price point across eight brands this year we think we have the ability to get drive a lot of unit sales and then we can ladder up in average unit retail as we add accessories that are more fashionoriented so from sport band to leather and other products that are brands that might command a higher premium but that under  killer price point with breadth of brand is what were going for operator and well hear from betty chen with mizuho securities betty chen  mizuho securities usa inc oh good afternoon everyone i was just curious as we get into the second half is there any color you can give us on sort of the inventory commitment for the smartwatches and trackers and wearables i know that you mentioned exiting q the inventory composition is very healthy just thinking about how we should expect that in the back half and then in terms of the wearables having slightly lower margin than traditional watches for now when should we expect the margin profile to be much more comparable is it going to be  or perhaps even further out just because of the way the business may ramp up thanks dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer sure on the margins i mean right now if you look at our connected products there is compression relative to the total the volumes are still – certainly right now theyre still relatively small theyll get bigger but still relative to the total theyll be smaller but its over time as we bring more brands onto the platform and produce more units its the benefits of scale as well as improved technology that we think ultimately can drive those costs down and provides with a feature set and provides an opportunity to add aur gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer yeah and the scale matters a lot in these products more so than our traditional business thats highly depreciated asset base that supports it so weve got to make a lot of upfront investments in engineering costs to get product to market that requires for each major product line over  million units to really reach scale were investing heavily on the supply side of our business to get our own captive manufacturing facilities to test assemble and bring these products to market and then weve got a large fixed cost base in the engineering resources and the software platform weve acquired with misfit so on all three of those dimensions weve got to get to scale to get to fullyloaded margins but a really good margins theres no reason longterm why we shouldnt be at our traditional margin structure the way that we see it kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer and on the inventory commitment were in the middle of this right now as getting projections from our customers doing forecasting looking at the supply chain really measuring all of this right now so its still early to tell as i mentioned there is a potential – potentially that we could do a reorder for holiday as well so its kind of a moving target right now operator and at this time id like to turn the conference back over to dennis secor for any additional or closing remarks dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you all for participating today and we

made two announcements today i will begin with a few prepared remarks on our third quarter performance followed by our announcement to acquire misfit before turning the call over to dennis secor our chief financial officer who is joining us remotely today following his prepared remarks greg mckelvey our chief strategy and marketing officer will join us for qa for the third quarter we delivered sales and earnings within our expectations given last years strong third quarter we knew the comparisons would be tough and that proved to be the case from a top line perspective and in constant currency overall sales declined  while we are certainly not satisfied with that result we executed well and delivered solid results in several parts of our business our initiative to drive our own brands is gaining traction as both fossil and skagen grew even amidst of difficult environment in constant currency our leathers and jewelry businesses both continued to grow as they have for the fullyear and our digital and omnichannel initiatives drove strong growth in our ecommerce channel the challenge remains with our watch business which declined in the quarter the traditional watch category remains sluggish as techenabled devices offer consumers additional choices compounding that negative impact is the fact that we are lapping the historical outsized success of the michael kors brand as a company with significant competitive advantages we are moving quickly and ramping up innovation and design marketing and technology to change the current trend in our business and continue to increase our share in the global watch and accessories market during the quarter the fossil brand grew  in constant currency with increases in each of our regions and global growth led by leathers and watches we launched a new fossil website during the quarter that incorporates compelling brand content and stories and enhanced customer shopping experience improved mobile capability and behind the scenes a worldclass content management system which is a critical element in support of our omnichannel initiatives the new website positions us to further build interest in the brand drive sales through an improved shopping experience and learn more about our customer and further develop their relationship with the brand well now to the third quarter development last month we launched our first connected accessories product with the fossil q product line this is our firstgeneration of wearable technology products that combines fashion and functionality we know that customers are interested in technology and fossil q allows us to bring together fashion and function in the assortment the reaction has been very positive not only to the product but the entire platform including the software application developed for users we distribute the assortment through select fossil retail doors and completely soldout the entire production quantity intended for our select wholesale partners i want to share a bit more about fossil q so you can appreciate the elements of the offering and understand our excitement we created a line of fashionable connected accessories that showcases our design excellence and expert craftsmanship in the stores now are two styles of watches that are nondisplay and two styles of tracker devices or connected bracelets the fossil q dreamer and reveler are designed for both men and women and our nondisplay fashion activity trackers that include notification alerts in the form of vibrations and led lights with a battery life lasting up to one week the fossil q grant is one of our topselling traditional analog watch styles for both men and women infused with technology that interacts with a smartphone and notifies the wearer of messages and phone calls from selected contacts through an led indicator and general vibration this battery also lasts up to a week availability at the end of the month the fossil q founder is our connected watch with display that utilizes android wear and is one of the first digital display watches to offer full compatibility with virtually all smartphones this product allows the wearer to customize their watch face as well as other features while utilizing the fossil q app the fossil q app was designed to be the command center for all the fossil q products it allows us to uniquely interact with customers provides important functionality like smart notifications and allows customers to learn more about themselves from tracking physical activity to counting calories and can connect seamlessly to other fitness apps that customers might already be using the exciting thing about the app is the opportunity to eventually carry the functionality across the brands in our licensed portfolio and create a unique specialized branded experience for the customer this will enable brands such as michael kors and others to compete in the connected accessories category and to attract new customers so overall for fossil a good third quarter a nice start to connect the accessories in october and we hope to build on the momentum we look forward to seeing how the assortment performs for the holiday period and the team is already hard at work on future generations of products as for skagen the brand had another good quarter with constant currency doubledigit global growth and increases in each of our regions watches led the performance and were also seeing continued positive responses to both leathers and jewelry we continue to see great potential with skagen through expanded global distribution fueled by excitement around its unique positioning and design turning to our multibrand watch portfolio during the third quarter our multibrand watch portfolio was down  to last year in constant currency a disappointing performance with declines across our three regions and with a single brand driving the vast majority of that decline we expected a tough quarter given last years strong performance the historical strength of the michael kors brand and consumers gravitation towards technology we believe we have the best fashion brands in our portfolio and are focused on driving innovation including designs colors styles and now technology to drive growth in this portion of our business we are enjoying the benefit of having kate spade in the portfolio and the team is working to further develop the assortment so we can fully leverage our distribution platform and expand the brands presence globally the team is also focused on developing the chaps assortment ahead of its launch in early  in our international markets we are being faced with nearterm macro challenges particularly in asia and china while we believe the same market dynamics that help drive our significant share gains in the us will play out in the region over time the current headwinds are impacting our business as traffic is challenged and economic conditions are volatile in asia we believe the market demographics will eventually move in our favor given the expected significant growth of the middleclass and we are well positioned to take advantage of fashion brands emerging to take share from traditional watch brands as for europe we also continue to see longer term opportunities as we grow in new markets and add more brands to our existing distribution for the last couple of years europe has been a strong driver of growth for us but those tailwinds have quickly turned to headwinds and we are now experiencing many of the same challenges weve seen in other markets now we will shift gear from our third quarter performance and talk about the market we find ourselves in today and how we are responding to the challenges and the opportunity as we discussed last quarter its a very dynamic and exciting time in retail and particularly in our space with disruption in the market comes opportunity to take advantage of growth and changing trends it reminds us of the last time we faced stagnant growth which is in  we regrouped and refocused our efforts on design and innovation and positioned fossil group for strong growth while todays source of disruption in the market is different than it was at that time our sense of determination focus and drive for innovation hasnt changed and with the strength of fossil q weve already proven our ability to identify and fill voids within a trending category delivering fashion and function that sets us apart from our peers currently technology is emerging as the latest trend in fashion with a growing interest in wearable technology inspiring new entrants into the watch space as well as explosive growth in activity trackers our acquisition of misfit will allow us to combine our key competitive advantages in design sourcing distribution and powerful brands with a business that is already a recognized player in technologyinfused accessories and possesses a worldclass software and hardware engineering team that stays ahead of emerging technology trends you can find additional information regarding misfit and their technology platform and the connected accessories opportunity in the slide presentation on our investor relations website for those of you that did not know misfit it is a company that started just a few years ago and is led by sonny vu a highly regarded thought leader in the wearable technology space they have a robust product pipeline focused on exciting techenabled experiences across multiple distribution channels including consumer technology healthcare enterprise and wholesale we are excited to have sonny join us as the president and chief technology officer of connected devices here at fossil group as well as the rest of the team at misfit as we have told many of you we envision a day when watches and accessories across all of our brands will be connected devices with the acquisition of misfit fossil group will be uniquely positioned to lead the convergence of style and technology to become the fashion gateway to the highgrowth wearable technology and connected device markets this acquisition accelerates our ability to compete in the connected accessory space as we expand our addressable market while leveraging all the design and scale with which we serve the existing watch market we are very excited about this acquisition for many reasons first misfits culture and qualities are aligned with fossil group like us misfit has an energetic culture that embraces innovation their team of roughly  people includes a highly talented engineering group that is focused on new technologies and functionality for accessories on top of this misfit shares our appreciation for design and branding with the use of color and unique style that surpasses others in the space and they have a holistic approach to technology that improves the quality of life with the integration of data tracking we expect to integrate misfits technology platform into our fossil and skagen brands and have the opportunity to do the same across our portfolio of powerful brands second misfit is a globally recognized wearable technology brand in the activity tracker space as many of you are aware the activity tracker space is one of the fastestgrowing segments in accessories given strong consumer interest in learning more about health wellness and improving the quality of life we believe some of the headwinds we have been experiencing result from a lack of technology in our core business and this acquisition will allow us to quickly start turning those headwinds into tailwinds and third we see a significant opportunity to drive top line growth we expect to accelerate misfit sales growth as we leverage our distribution platform and their pipeline of innovative products well also leverage misfits scalable cloud and app platform and its worldclass engineering team to develop cutting edge technologyinfused products for our portfolio beginning in holiday of  sonny and the team at misfit will collaborate with fossil group to develop new functionality for accessories that is relevant for our brands and customers and while in the nearterm our focus will be on driving sales growth we also see margin expansion opportunities longer term from the added scale misfit will bring to our company this is a very exciting development for fossil group and we believe it is a great investment in the future of the company overall we continue to believe based on independent forecasts that the watch category will grow over the next several years beyond that we believe that technology can expand that growth by bringing new customers those that dont traditionally wear watches into the space within that category and with our strategic advantages the design branding and distribution we believe we are poised to gain share while recently we believe we have been disadvantaged as the fashion trend in watches is about technology with misfit we believe we are poised to capitalize on todays fashion in a differentiated way that helps consumers enhance their lives simply put we will marry fashion with technology and distribute it with strong branding across our distribution platform and with that id like to turn it over to dennis for more comments dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks kosta and good afternoon everyone id like to start with discussing our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year before going into additional detail regarding the misfit acquisition third quarter net sales decreased  and on a reported basis declined  to  million while sales overall were soft partially due to the strong quarter we experienced in  they came in at the low end of our expectations for the quarter we delivered earnings per share of  compared to  last year compared to the third quarter of  this quarters eps was negatively impacted by roughly  due to currencies and another  due to our restructuring charges our investments to support our strategic initiatives and enhanced marketing totaled about  per share and the current quarter benefited  due to a lower tax rate fossil sales increased  in constant dollars leathers and watches grew while jewelry was flat sales for the brand increased in all three regions with the highest growth in asia the brand drove positive comps in europe and a doubledigit increase in our global ecomm business driven by higher traffic and improved conversion rates skagen sales grew  in constant dollars with growth in all three regions solid growth in watches drove the business with increases in leathers and jewelry as well in constant dollars our multibrand watch portfolio declined  compared to last year partially due to last years tough  comparison but also it is clear that technology is putting pressure on the traditional watch category compounding this effect is the fact that we have brands in our portfolio that are lapping historically explosive growth in the americas reported sales decreased  to  million a  constant dollar decrease the decrease was driven by watches as a decline in the category offset modest growth in leathers and jewelry across brands constant dollar sales for the armani brands skagen and fossil increased during the quarter and we continued to benefit from the addition of kate spade new york the remainder of the brands within the portfolio declined within the region growth in the retail channel was driven by a strong performance in canada which was offset by a decline in wholesale sales comp store sales declined slightly as traffic continued to be down in the region particularly in markets that benefit from heavy tourism were pleased with our ecomm results where sales increased across all of our websites constant dollar wholesale sales were down to last year largely driven by us department stores where the business continues to be soft in europe the sharp change in trend that we experienced in the second quarter continued into the third as reported sales decreased  to  million constant dollar sales decreased  modest growth in jewelry and leathers offset a decline in watches the decline in the region was driven by the licensed portfolio offsetting growth in fossil and skagen where watches drove the growth in both brands within the region declines in distributor markets and the uk offset slight increases in france and italy in the region growth in the retail channel was driven by new stores and positive comps including a solid performance in fossil stores our ecomm business performed very well in the quarter with strong doubledigit growth supported by more effective investments in marketing in asia reported sales decreased  to  million while constant dollar sales decreased  growth in leathers offset the decline in watches and a slight decline in jewelry strong growth in india was offset by declines in most markets in the region including korea hong kong and china where general economic sluggishness and changing travel patterns continue to impact our business michael kors fossil and skagen were our strongest performers with each of the brands delivering increases comp store sales decreased in the region before i move past sales let me pause and provide some additional context to reiterate kostas point we are not satisfied with our top line as you can see from our announcements today we are committed to investing to drive growth the data we collect suggest that very recently the watch category has declined with what we believe are two root causes first techenabled watches are clearly impacting traditional watches some of that may be temporary but the data clearly support that second the huge success that the michael kors brand had in driving interest of the category has not yet translated to other brands it is a phenomenon that can obviously affect our results but also masks our overall performance on a yeartodate basis excluding michael kors our watch business is roughly flat in constant dollars and we believe outperforming the overall category our independent research shows that apart from michael kors we are gaining share in the us watch market at price points under  and we believe weve got the best set of brands to drive share gains in the future again we are not satisfied and we remain committed to driving growth but we believe that despite the current challenges we have been able to maintain and advance our leadership position so moving back now to the quarters results in the quarter gross profit decreased to  million and gross margin declined  basis points to  the decrease was primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies excluding the currency headwind gross margin actually expanded during the quarter mainly due to our pricing initiatives and lower product costs partially offset by markdown and clearance activities third quarter operating expenses decreased  to  million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency and included  million for restructuring programs that we announced earlier as planned excluding the impact of currencies and restructuring operating expenses increased slightly due to increased marketing and advertising investments investments to support strategic initiatives and new store expenses associated with  store openings infrastructure expenses were down compared to last year our third quarter operating expense rate was  compared to  operating income decreased to  million including a  million unfavorable currency impact and operating margin decreased to  including a basispoint headwind from currencies higher marketing and strategic investments greater retail mix deleverage on fixed costs given the sales decline and restructuring charges offset by constant dollar gross margin improvements accounted for the other changes in operating margin interest expense increased to  million given our higher debt levels third quarter other income increased  million to  million due to net gains on foreign currency contracts and account balances our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was  lower than last years  due to the favorable impact of foreign tax credits recognized during the quarter third quarter net income decreased to  million largely due to lower sales and operating income partially offset by lower taxes now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet for the quarter our operations consumes  million of cash versus providing  million a year ago we drew down a net  million on a revolver we invested  million in capex and  million to repurchase roughly  shares of our common stock at an average price of  we ended the quarter with  million remaining on our repurchase authorization we ended the quarter with  million in cash and  million in debt third quarter ending inventory totaled  million a  increase compared to last year given lower demand this year our inventory growth is primarily in our betterselling brands and we have adjusted our receipt plans to reflect changing sales trends we also are working to reduce our swiss inventory levels which are higher than planned given sluggishness in certain markets like asia accounts receivable decreased by  to  million and wholesale dsos were in line with the prior year depreciation and amortization expense totaled  million for the quarter now let me share with you our updated outlook for the rest of the year the bulk of my analysis will exclude the impact of currencies restructuring charges and misfit transaction costs i will provide the related gaap numbers at the end which will include those items given our expectation that the misfit acquisition will close late in the fourth quarter we dont expect the impact on our operating results other than the transaction costs will be material after that ill talk about the acquisition of misfit and how we see that affecting our sales growth operating results and capital deployment over the next few years lets start with the rest of  as a reminder the factors that weve always anticipated would affect our  results have materialized and have not abated in fact some have intensified since last we spoke us dollar continues to be relatively strong putting pressure on both top line growth and margins the phenomenal historical success of probably the hottest fashion watch brand ever michael kors is affecting our yearoveryear comparisons and it is clear that wearables on the wrist are here to stay giving our existing customers new choices while also expanding the population of new people mainly millennials who want to wear something on their wrist we think thats affecting the category as a whole in the immediate nearterm but it provides us a huge opportunity over time over the last quarter we also saw a sequential change in each of our regional businesses with category pressures intensifying uniformly in the americas with continued category softness we expect wholesale partners will manage inventory levels tightly impacting fourth quarter receipt plans on our last call we reported that we had not anticipated the significant slowdown that we experienced in the second quarter in europe in addition to many economic factors that are weighing on the region we now believe that many of the same factors that are affecting the category in other regions are impacting our european business especially in the wholesale channels there are still several markets where we continue to see significant whitespace opportunities but markets like the uk and the middle east have been challenging and we now expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter finally in asia while there are pockets of strength like india which continues to be a big longterm opportunity most markets continue to be sluggish and our third quarter business did not materialize as we had planned while there are headwinds in our business we continue to be pleased with our progress in fossil and skagen and look forward to a holiday period supported by the marketing investments we have been making to continue to build and drive traffic both to stores and websites and were very excited about the launch of our fossil q wearables the response from customers has been encouraging and were excited about the buzz that these great products have created given those factors for the fourth quarter were expecting constant dollar sales to decline between  and  excluding the impact of last years extra first quarter week this would result in a full year sales decline between  and  we are planning constant dollar gross margins flat to slightly down in the quarter our price initiatives continue to drive improvements in our margins though we have now anniversaried some of our initial price increases so the benefit will not be as strong as weve seen in recent quarters the change in trajectory of our international businesses where margins are stronger will offset some of that benefit also given the softness in the watch category we also expect we may need to invest to help traffic and move inventory during the key holiday period overall for the full year we expect a modest expansion of constant dollar gross margin for the fourth quarter we are planning with a higher expense rate driven mainly by the investments we are making in marketing and in our strategic initiatives and these will account for nearly half of the rate growth the rate will also be affected by last years fourth quarter reversal of performance compensation accruals and the impact of this years lower sales on our fixed infrastructure overall we expect our full year expense rate will be higher mainly due to the strategic investments along with the impact of stores that we opened in  given these factors we are planning adjusted fourth quarter operating margin in the range of  and  and fullyear adjusted operating margin in the range between  and  in constant dollars we estimate that fourth quarter adjusted eps would be in the range between  and  per share and full year constant dollar adjusted eps would be in the range between  and  per share on a reported basis we anticipate fourth quarter sales to decline in the range between  and  and full year sales to decline in the range between  and  we expect reported fourth quarter operating margin in the range between  and  and full year operating margin in the range between  and  we expect reported fourth quarter eps in the range between  and  and full year eps in the range between  and  these reported amounts include restructuring charges of  million or  per share for the full year of which  million or  per share will be recorded in the fourth quarter they also include an estimated  million or  per share for misfit transaction costs which will also be recorded as an operating expense in the fourth quarter we are planning with the fourth quarter tax rate of  given the lower tax rate in the third quarter we are now planning the full year with the tax rate of roughly  and we now expect annual capex to be approximately  million our guidance continues to include higher interest costs due to increased debt levels and additional share repurchase more in line with our third quarter activities now let me share some additional perspective on misfit and how we see this opportunity impacting our financials and capital deployment over the next few years theres plenty of growth still left in traditional watches where we have a clear competitive advantage but there are customers mainly millennials who dont wear watches because watches dont give them the functionality that they want and thats tech then there is a wearables market estimated to grow at a  cagr to  billion by  despite that enormous growth we believe there are consumers who wont participate in connected accessories because it doesnt give them what they want fashion and design across the brands that they love we believe our acquisition of misfit with the scalable tech platform it brings and the worldclass engineering team it brings fast forwards fossil group to be the one company that can drive the convergence of the growing watch and wearables markets with all the necessary capabilities to compete design and innovation global distribution and operating platform worldclass supply chain and scale to drive the right economics a leadingedge tech platform and app experience and the best lifestyle brand that consumers love there are and will be companies who can design great products but who lack the scale that our production volumes of nearly  million watches a year create there are and will be companies who design great products at scale but they lack the breadth of our portfolio of  lifestyle brands there are and will be companies who produce big volumes of tech products but they lack the design and style that so many consumers demand when we do that analysis we believe that we are uniquely positioned in this market and set up to win like no one else can the integration of technology into watches is the next innovation in the evolution of the category and we believe we can once again do what we did to the functional watch category grow and gain share by elegantly and seamlessly blending design and brands with function we believe that this acquisition can be the catalyst to reverse our most recent trends to quickly restore growth and has the potential to drive strong growth beyond what we might have imagined just a couple of years ago it will not be easy and it will require additional investments this is arguably one of the hottest consumer trends right now and now its the time to invest in marketing and building awareness for our brands and amazing new products thats what we plan to do in  so while we expect the acquisition will drive growth next year beyond growing misfits roughly  million  revenues we expect earnings and margin dilution for next year it will also not be until the second half of next year that we can bring products to market that leverage the misfit platform these assumptions assume a relatively stable currency environment so s earnings unrelated to the acquisition of misfit would not benefit from the significant nonoperating currency gains that s earnings did as we move past next year wed expect growth to accelerate as we bring more brands onto the platform as that growth accelerates we do expect to see downward pressure on gross margins as wearables becomes a larger part of our mix we also expect that accelerated growth will provide an opportunity for infrastructure leverage that can begin to restore sequential earnings growth now let me discuss briefly how we think of this transaction in terms of our capital structure and deployment as weve always said our top priority for capital deployment is to drive growth to deliver value to shareholders and this fits that priority perfectly at the purchase price of  million including transaction costs it is a similar size deal to our skagen acquisition in  while were still very pleased with skagen the misfit acquisition will play a much broader strategic role in driving growth it does give us a brand that is native to the wearables space and we believe we have great potential to drive that brand growth by leveraging our global distribution and operating platform beyond that though the capabilities and speed that it brings we believe can be an enormous catalyst to drive growth across our entire portfolio and deliver even greater value to shareholders investing in share repurchase has always been an important though secondary vehicle by which we deliver value to our shareholders we will finance the acquisition which represents a little more than one year of free cash flow through a combination of bank debt and repatriated international cash it does bring our leverage ratios to levels where we have not historically operated though we believe still with ample liquidity to fund our operations capital needs while leaving some dry powder to be opportunistic our nearterm strategy then will be to prioritize our free cash flow to restore leverage ratios to more recent levels likely limiting nearterm share repurchases to levels sufficient to offset dilution from annual employee equity activity so to close kosta said it best in todays earnings release we remain confident in our longterm strategies we believe the substantial capabilities we acquire with misfit and the many opportunities it creates combined with our diversified business model our solid financial position and cash flow generation set us up to win over the long term and drive value for our shareholders we are very excited about our future so with that ill turn the call back to the operator for your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and well take our first question from erinn murphy with piper jaffray erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker great thanks good afternoon i was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about the wholesale dynamic in north america you talk about your retail partners managing inventory very tightly right now i guess how much are they shrinking the opentobuy dollars on the overall watch category that would be my first question and ive got a couple of followups kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer we havent seen a significant pullback on the inventory flow and it looks to us when we analyze it it looks like its relative to the sales which obviously the trend is down but the inventories look to be in good shape for us for the back half of the year and well move forward from there but we dont see any significant pullback erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay so i guess if i look at your sales guidance for the fourth quarter then is that all just sellthrough rates decelerating to that range or is there an assumption that there is effectively no reorders from or something else more draconian than that in the fourth quarter guide just im just trying to understand that dynamic dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah no this its we experienced in the third quarter sequentially we saw a slowdown in each one of our businesses so we believe that given where we are that we could see some tightness everywhere europe is actually the largest change in the way weve been thinking about the fourth quarter from where we were before so weve lowered our expectations to accommodate the fact that we think that the fourth quarter could not be as strong as we had anticipated going in i mean we always operate with a relative limited visibility so a lot remains to be seen and most of the business is done in the second half of the quarter and we dont operate with backlog but weve left a fairly wide range to accommodate lower sellin and sellthrough erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay and then i guess just last question on michael kors you did highlight that a number of times in your prepared remarks just on the kind of comping the pretty tough comp from last year when do you think we officially cycle that or how much more kind of pruning or kind of rightsizing of that brand needs to happen because it does seem to your point earlier that europe is now starting to go through that reset on the brand so im just curious on how you think about that over the next  to  to  months kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well as we said were going through some pretty tough comparisons mostly in the us and europe but in the meantime were ramping up a lot on automatics were adding additional assortments and locations for jewelry were building more shopinshops asia is still in its infancy for kors so theres a lot of opportunity there and the big opportunity over the next couple years is going to be adding wearables to this we think it could turbocharge that business quite a bit so in addition to that i would say that the michael kors business is still extremely productive our most productive brand very powerful globally so we expect that business will probably settle a bit for a while well get wearables in there next year and then well set it up for more longterm growth its a very strong global brand its unique in the world and its a great brand and one were very pleased to go to battle with over the long term erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay thank you guys ill let someone else jump in dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator and well take our next question from omar saad with evercore isi omar saad  evercore isi thank you good afternoon so wanted to followup my first question on the wearables piece a lot of stuff going on there its obviously a really tiny percentage of your business now but you mentioned theres some data that youre seeing that gives you a lot of confidence in this obviously enough confidence to make a sizable acquisition help us understand a where youre getting this confidence to make this kind of bet on the wearables piece and then maybe a little bit more details around misfit specifically the app platform versus the hardware side what the key ingredients are there that you can leverage in your existing businesses gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer this is greg mckelvey yeah in terms of the confidence in the size of the category its – i think the first is were seeing the market develop where its increasingly clear to us that wearable technology is and will be a large growing category theres projections out there that are putting it about  billion in the next four years or five years with roughly twothirds of that being wrist wearing that would put the size of that market at roughly the same size of the under  global watch market and we believe that all three categories that make up that market which would be activity trackers smartwatches with display and then the third being smarter watches so integrating technology similar to what youd find in activity tracker into the same type of watches we sell today all three of those are viable products that are – that we see actually are fossil q launch being very successful with so were going – part of that we see the market is developing and we have a position to play in it with misfit its – weve learned a lot in the last couple years in developing products and bringing to market fossil q we believe that were now in a connected age where apps and cloud services are effectively now a part of product and an extension of brand and that needs to support and mirror our business model of today so meaning multibrand fashion and designdriven and globallyscalable and its so integral now to product and brand development that its really too important to outsource that to somebody else so we need – we want to own that customer experience own the platform be able to have – be get to market much more quickly and then as we scale it across the breadth of our portfolio of brands in  languages in  countries just a pure economics of scaling our product size breadth number of brands across the fixed cost of the development of that platform makes for a much more attractive margins ultimately than wed get if we fully outsourced it and then – sorry id just add one other thing in misfit specifically theyve got a very talented team that spent the last four years solving some of the hardest problems in wearables including battery life and their platform has already – because theyve got – is already supporting multiple brands given their partnerships with swarovski and victorias secret and others theyre global especially with strengths in the us and in asia which is important to us theyve got an month pipeline of products and innovation that were going to be able to extend not only into the misfit brand but into the full breadth of our product portfolio and brand portfolio and then its a digitally native brand as we discussed on the call as well that allows us to get into consumer electronics and healthcare and enterprise and other channels were not in today so a significant opportunity to expand our addressable market kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah its clear to us that the wrist devices are selling theyre selling in terms of trackers and also in new entrants in smartwatches you could say for our overall watch business that we have a fashion miss which is we dont have technology across our platform there seems to be and just to the general watch business that people are maybe waiting to see theyre looking for technology theyre not sure and in the meantime our wrist devices with technology are selling extremely quickly so we think that one of the most important fashion trends right now in the industry is this huge interest on the consumer side of the convergence of fashion and technology and we are moving very quickly to make sure that we can scale technology in many different ways across our platform as we mentioned not just in android display smartwatches but across our entire platform of devices and watches putting sensors and connectivity et cetera and we think actually at some point everything we make will have some type of chip in it that will add additional functionality and not a lot of additional cost because the fact that we make  million pieces of accessories a year and that its going to enable us to scale it across our entire organization but its all the stuff weve talked about in the past one thing is millennials clearly overspend on technology there is a – seems to be a slowdown in consumer activity overall but one thing thats clear is consumers are still spending on technology we think that continues we also know that from our past consumers will spend on additional functionality a lot of our growth over the last five years has come from us adding chronographs and other technical features at a higher average retail and consumers are very willing to spend it and thats one of things were going to be putting in there the other thing to remember is the watch industry is fundamentally a small business about  billion globally so the projections on the wearable business are that its going to grow very quickly and at some point it will be the same size of the watch business but if you look at the trillions thats being spent on technology right now from all different types of cell phones and service and games et cetera the small percentage of that spending comes into our accessory business it can make a huge impact and thats what were working for and this acquisition also gives us the ability to innovate and differentiate us from our competitors were going to be able to put products in the market that are unique and special and address peoples lives in many different ways and its going to be a very unique and longterm opportunity for us to differentiate and to innovate like we do in the rest of our business dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer and if i could just add one more thought is that we absolutely remain at the core of the traditional watch market but what this allows us to do is really to be all things to all people on the wrist so whether its design fashion style or brands or now tech and the additional functionality and that community that brings we think that we have the products to merge that together and we can do it in a way that nobody else can omar saad  evercore isi if i could bring the wearables conversation to line it up with the michael kors conversation do you think that female yearold to yearold michael kors fashion watch consumer that had been buying watches has now switched and is buying fitbits and apple watches or do you think she is on the sideline because she is waiting to see whats going to happen to the space or was there a lack of newness and innovation and new products for her within the michael kors line and that the majority had enough products and styles help me understand what do you think is going on between wearables and michael kors specifically because it is so big and was such a big growth driver kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer excellent question what weve seen from kors is a huge audience of kors fans out there that over the last  years have fallen in love with the brand and have bought kors products that the overall look of that is what we would call boyfriend so its a mens watch on a woman most of those customers and a lot of them have multiples of those watches and id say one thing we havent done which were working on right now is we havent innovated off of that idea fast enough and youre going to see a whole new assortment of kors watches next year even before the wearable technology comes in were going to totally change the look its more modern simpler et cetera theres a totally new look for it it gives the consumers the kors fans reason to buy another watch but clearly when we put the wearable technology in there and we put – michael kors themselves gets behind it and the entire power of that organization is talking about technology and how can it fit with the kors lifestyle et cetera we think its another catalyst for another phase of growth and i think thats – the idea of technology injecting with fashion is so relevant today especially with the millennial customer we think its going to fit and dovetail perfectly with our longterm michael kors strategy omar saad  evercore isi so to summarize you think its a combination of lack of the wearable technology but also maybe a little bit of lack in newness and innovation kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer absolutely omar saad  evercore isi thanks guys for all the information operator and well take our next question from rick patel with stephens rick patel  stephens inc thank you good afternoon just a couple of questions first on the fossil q founder does that have the one week battery life as well or is that just a fossil q grant that you were referring to and then secondly any color on the pricing of fossil founder and perhaps the economics of it since youre partnering with google and intel im curious about how each unit sold is going to impact sales and profitability dennis i think you mentioned the negative impact of lower margins but any way to frame that quantitatively gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer this is greg the q grant has a week or more battery life q founder will have a day to two days depending on use price points on q founder are  to  and then q grant is  to  and then in terms of economics we dont release margins on these products id say that compare to where the growth that were expecting for gen  and gen  over the next  months and  months were going to see a heck of a lot more unit volume and margin expansion as we go into next year id still call generation  our first foray into the market limited inventory risk that we took in q as were just sort of starting to see how the products perform but were giving app store both on apple and google app stores very good scores its performing really well at both wholesale and our own directtoconsumer channel so were going to start to step into more volume as the holiday season goes on and early next year kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer the other thing i would add dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer just on the margin as well greg is right were not giving specific details of them the volumes in the fourth quarter are relatively low the way we think about this going forward into the future is that we do expect as it becomes a larger part of the mix that that should drive some downward pressure just because the category historically has not been as strong margins as we yield on the other hand as we scale there should be some opportunity for the scale economics to kick in and help to offset some of that but over time the way we think about it now is wed expect some general margin headwinds having said that kosta alluded to this that as we add innovation to products there is an opportunity for us to claim greater price and drive aur all that remains to be seen but if youre thinking about next year this should probably give us a little bit of margin headwind kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah one thing that just in the tech industry and especially with our – the expertise were going to gain from misfit is everything is going to get better battery life is going to get better chips are going to get better and less expensive the objects are going to get smaller and well be able to put next year or shortly thereafter womens smartwatches out there our android smartwatches at some point probably next year will be untethered which means you dont need your smartphone with you but all of this is going to get better especially with us having the expertise to be an innovator and be on the front edge of all this technology and working with partners et cetera were going to be able to bring more compelling products that will look better feel better margins will be better and well be able to add lot of function to fashion without a lot of intrusiveness so were going to be in a pretty good position rick patel  stephens inc and as you roll out wearables are you going to have to augment your display cases and department stores and jewelry stores versus what you have for analog watches and if so how should we think about the impact its going to have either on depreciation or expenses or capex kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer well weve already done that if you see the q presentations of both our stores and also in department stores youll see that weve added some incase and top of counter and some other display but as a matter of course we refresh those anyway on an ongoing basis so i wouldnt say its any additional cost generally its more just changing from one thing to another so it is going to be part of it but it shouldnt be a big expense gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer the other thing id add is this is also a big part of the value of the misfit platform so their technology is built on replaceable coin cell or watchtype batteries so their whole software runs on those what that allows us to do is very quickly scale both smarter watches and activity trackers that use those coin cell batteries across our global sales organization across all channels without having to worry about putting power and expensive fixtures in place so it gives us speed and much lower cost in operating expense and in capex rick patel  stephens inc thank you good luck this holiday dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator and well take our next question from simeon siegel with nomura securities simeon a siegel  nomura securities international inc thanks good afternoon guys sorry if i missed this but is the goal for misfit to take the place of intel and google for all the connected devices and i guess if thats correct what happens to the devices you have in the interim and then dennis can you just talk about the conflicting factors mentioned in the press release of pricing initiatives versus the higher markdowns that we have on this quarters gross margin thanks gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer yeah this is greg ill take the first one in terms of our technology partnerships intel and google who are both of our announced partnerships they have been fantastic partners and will continue to be partners with us the misfit acquisition is really about owning the cloud on the app platform given how integral it is now to product and brand and customer experience so well own that part of the customer experience through the app and cloud but we will continue to partner with the leading technology companies across the world to continue to build the right ecosystem of partners to compete in this space so well – the best hardware providers the best contract manufacturer the right ecosystem cloud partners whether thats music or fitness or what have you so it still takes an entire ecosystem this is just about us owning the cloud and app platform thats now part of product and brand dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah in terms of the margin the pricing – generally speaking the pricing adjustments that weve made weve seen the margin yields that we were anticipating for the year sales have not materialized as we had expected so inventory levels as you saw are certainly higher and so we will be likely then moving more inventory through different channels that would put some pressure on the margins that weve included in the guidance but to manage our inventory at the appropriate levels simeon a siegel  nomura securities international inc okay so the higher markdowns are on different products then were you able to take the price on dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah its different – its different product and i also mentioned that were a little heavy in swiss and well likely invest a little there to make sure those levels of inventory appropriate simeon a siegel  nomura securities international inc great all right thanks a lot guys and best of luck for holiday dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator and well take our next question from lindsay drucker mann with goldman sachs lindsay beth drucker mann  goldman sachs  co thanks good evening everyone dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer good evening lindsay beth drucker mann  goldman sachs  co i just i wanted to get some context around your outlook for smarter accessories and watches versus traditional ones and given some of the headwinds you cited for millennial consumers and their acceptance of traditional watches and embracing digital ones how we should think about the risk to your traditional watch sales for next year thanks dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer well i think our view is that were at a point now where this is a natural evolution we see these markets coming together where those who traditionally have not participated in the traditional watch market theyre now more accessible to us because we have the ability to add tech to the product so we are as i said a few minutes ago i really think the way we view this is that weve now got the best of both worlds in that we can be all things to all people on the wrist so that if to the extent that youre a customer for whom design fashion style branding matter and youre not interested in tech we still are advantaged there this expands our another arrow in our quiver to attack an additional market and go after additional consumers lindsay beth drucker mann  goldman sachs  co i guess my question would be gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer id add one other lindsay beth drucker mann  goldman sachs  co sure gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer sorry id add one other data point for you that remember  or  of our revenues today are female fashionconscious customers and the smartwatch market in particular today is still maledominated females are playing in the activity tracker space so its really not replacing for female fashionconscious customers anyway smartwatches are not having a large overlap today so we see however an opportunity for all three of the categories that were going to be bringing to market to support and drive growth with that customer that core customer lindsay beth drucker mann  goldman sachs  co got it but as we think about the speed at which you can scale these new platforms and have to build them and some of the lead times should we be thinking about your north american business as one that can given some of the headwinds you talked about in the traditional category should we be thinking of that as a business that can grow next year or are you anticipating further revenue pressure dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so we havent yet guided for  so the way i would think about it is the acquisition itself provides us for opportunities for tailwinds for growth for next year misfit by itself our ability to accelerate that growth through our own distribution sales force and our ability to leverage our platform or the misfit platform across some of our brands that will be later in the second half of the year and it wont include all of the brands on the platform next year but there will be tailwinds there fossil and skagen we see as tailwinds in  every region those brands are growing in were seeing benefits from the marketing investments that we are making and our omni investments are also yielding dividends our ecommerce business has been up so theres a lot of tailwinds going into next year what remains to be seen is what are the – and we really need the fourth quarter to get better informed about this what are the category trends how is the consumer feeling economic trends brand trends so we need more and well learn more through the fourth quarter but we see a portfolio going into next year that includes a number of tailwinds including this acquisition will provide many of those lindsay beth drucker mann  goldman sachs  co great thanks so much dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you bet operator  we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up today well take our next question from oliver chen with cowen and company oliver chen  cowen and company llc hi thank you kosta what do you think are the nearterm differences that you can make to stimulate demand i know the sellins are mostly done for the holiday season but as we look to spring are you going to have a radically changed assortment across all your brands including kors or is kors kind of the main focus for transformation and then did the watch market did it also decline doubledigits im just curious about how the market moved versus your constant currency results kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah actually were moving very quickly across our entire spectrum of products with innovation and new materials new ideas changing as much as possible changing point of sale you could even if you see our fossil store for example and you saw weve had pretty good results in there weve totally changed the way we have our presentations done the products look great and were showing some pretty good increases relative to the market so this is a typical pro forma for us when times get tough we innovate like crazy and put more designs in there take some chances et cetera and typically during tough times we come out of it in a pretty strong growth our operating model is really built for resilience and flexibility our inventory turns are faster than the rest of the market our design innovation is better and quicker our resources are broader and have a larger scale just giving you one example is that we globally most of our business is done through our own wholly owned subsidiaries where our competitors largely use distributors so when times get tough distributors pull back on their inventory investment et cetera we just keep going so this is a time for us to get stronger take more share while were moving very quickly to disrupt the market with new innovation the technology and new ideas et cetera so we think were in a pretty good position over the next couple of years we think it will play out pretty well for us dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah and then on the us market the data that we collect independent data covers not all but a substantial part of the market about  of the us market at our price points and as we mentioned on the call when we exclude the impact of kors we see us our watch business outperforming the us market in third quarter at our price points oliver chen  cowen and company llc okay best regards for the holiday season and next year dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you very much operator and well take our next question from ed yruma with keybanc capital markets edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc hi thanks for taking my questions i guess first i know historically you havent provided markdown support for your wholesale partners but i guess what do you or can you do in a time like this where sales trends are deteriorating pretty meaningfully and then second i know youve talked about wearables having a lower margin profile i guess maybe a little bit more color and i know obviously this is changing with your acquisition thank you kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well the one advantage also in our operating model is that watches and accessories theyre not typically theres not a weatherrelated component to it theres not a lot of seasonality its not like swimwear and shorts and outerwear et cetera so the margins that retailers get are relatively high and its not typically been a big part of our ongoing business model we dont expect that to change dramatically as far as the wearables as weve been talking about we have a lower gross margin now but we think over long term as quantities come into play and we scale this across our platform that we can actually have a situation where were able to increase that over time just looking at moores law and chips get less expensive and more robust and we think that will play out for us especially with our quantities and how were going to go to market and especially also with us having the expertise to develop this ourselves rather than rely on third parties largely to do most of it dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah the other aspect of longer term as you think about the margins even to the extent that gross margins are modestly expanding or even if theyre still creating a headwind we think that theres an opportunity to leverage the entire infrastructure and the platform across all of our brands and distribution that provides us a lot of power to drive operating margin expansion over time we wont see that immediately because were not getting all the benefits of leveraging the platform over the portfolio all the way in  but over time we think that could be significant edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc got it and one follow up if i may you mentioned that fx obviously and some of the hedges you have wont be working in your favor next year is that simply just looking at that other income line and assuming that that goes closer to zero thank you dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thats right its exactly right you wont have the benefit of those contracts because most of those have run now edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc thanks so much dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you bet operator and well move to our next question from ike boruchow with wells fargo ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc hi everyone thanks for taking my question just a quick one on your qs sales guidance i mean when you look back historically youve guided within a range of two points this year its nine points im just – if you can give us some more detail about the visibility that you have i mean historically youve had some predictability there and just kind of the ongoing discussions with your wholesale partners maybe regionbyregion just trying to understand the sellin and sellout kind of dynamic that youre dealing with daytoday right now dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer well as i said before we dont have is a lot of visibility we dont operate with backlogs what we do – do is as we analyze our business in a lot of different ways we look at it regionally by category by brand i did say earlier the biggest change in the way were thinking about the fourth quarter comes from europe where going into this last quarter we had seen one quarter of less favorable performance following about seven or eight of very strong doubledigit or so growth coming out of europe so the trajectory changed there fairly quickly so weve adjusted our expectations i mean were coming off a down  third quarter up against a  weve provided a wide range to reflect a relatively choppy environment right now thats difficult to predict and we want to be able to accommodate in our range the deteriorating trends the second quarter we saw a stepdown from q going into q and most of the business in the fourth quarter happens in the back part of the quarter its going to be largely dependent on reorders and how our wholesale partners are looking to manage their inventories at their yearend ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc got it and dennis when you said the acquisition was – i think you said it was dilutive to  was that dilutive to your margins or dilutive to your eps just want to make sure dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer both ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc got it thank you so much dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you bet operator and well take our next question from anna andreeva with oppenheimer anna andreeva  oppenheimer  co inc broker great thanks so much good afternoon guys kosta n kartsotis  chairman  chief executive officer good afternoon dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer good afternoon anna andreeva  oppenheimer  co inc broker i guess to dennis an earlier comment about needing to invest in the business can you may be talk about the puts and takes on the gross margin versus sga lines as we think about  could next year i guess be a down earnings year for fossil given some of the investments and also a question on the store footprint you guys have been adding new doors at a pretty healthy clip should we expect that to change as the focus shifts towards wearables and any opportunity – additional opportunity to close doors thanks dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so again in terms of growth thinking about next year so a fairly nearterm kind of lens on this i would expect just because of the nature of wearables we would expect to see some modest headwinds in the gross margins in terms of the way were planning the expense line we have been holding infrastructure tight and we think that is the way were going to manage  weve actually been operating with very limited store growth and we would expect to continue to do that into next year one thing that we have to work through that we dont have yet is just what are the purchase accounting implications of the misfit acquisition and how that will likely affect the expense line but what we believe is that – i mean this is the hottest category right now and now its the time for us to invest were seeing traction from the investments that were making in fossil in skagen and omni and we intend to continue to do that and really drive the top line again we talked about it in the last call or the last question rather currency theyre going to impact our earnings because in  you really saw it in the operating margins but the earnings were lifted up because we have the nonoperating contracts supporting it below the line now in  were going to be anywhere from a yearandahalf to twoandahalf years outside of when the dollar really started strengthening so the contracts only buy you time and now thats been neutralized so even in the base business all other things being equal the currencies because of the lack of those nonoperating gains are going to create earnings headwinds operator and well move to our next question from heather balsky with bank of america heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch hi good evening thanks for taking my call i was wondering if you could just talk about how youre thinking about your sga investments next year outside of marketing around the wearables if – especially if you do see the greater than expected sales weakness in the fourth quarter would your plan be to invest more in marketing to drive awareness to drive traffic dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer that is where – i mean as i just said in the last – the framework for us for next year is whole infrastructure stores tight but invest where were seeing returns and were seeing returns in fossil and skagen in the third quarter those brands were both up and theres not a lot of brands that are able to drive growth in a pretty challenging environment so were seeing returns we expect to invest omnichannel is another investment where were seeing good solid returns in our ecomm business and those are the areas were going to invest again wearables is hot right now this is the time for us to be investing in it and thats the way were approaching  heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer yeah i had heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch oh sorry gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer i had couple of more points on top of the marketing investment we are investing based on last years the results in very targeted ways largely digital and almost all traffic driving so very good returns more shortterm focused and we – it gives us the ability also to quickly respond to the effectiveness that were seeing so – and then on omnichannel investments we have some pretty leading indicator so far on the investments paying out not just in the traffic and conversion improvements that were seeing online but l recently came out with some reports that put us as a top mover in the space compared to the rest of the fashion peer set and the initiatives that were deploying now are just going to continue to drive momentum there and then on the social side were seeing a lot of momentum as well with pretty significant follower growth and sentiment so those all give us a lot of confidence that the investments are paying out and well continue to compound as we go into next year heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then separate question in terms of your direct performance i was wondering if you could just quickly tell us how outlet performed compared to your full priced channel dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you know what let me – im remote today i dont have those data in front of me may be somebody can grab and i can get that in just a second heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch sure thank you thats it dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer operator if you want to move to the next question and we can come back to that operator and well take our next question from laurent vasilescu with macquarie laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc good afternoon can you provide a bit more color on the composition of the inventory by product category should we see watches are up highsingle to lowdoubledigits yearoveryear and if thats the case whats the kind of exit strategy youre looking for and then where do you think inventories will stack up for next quarter dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah the inventory – our inventory was up  which is obviously outpacing the sales growth in the business higher than we planned the growth is primarily in our strongest selling brands but as you have falling demand just giving leadtimes it takes a while to turn through it so we see most of that as a timing issue that we ultimately can work through i did mention earlier that we are a bit heavier given the performance in markets like asia on our swiss inventories and were working through those as well laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc and can you talk about the intellectual property you acquired with misfit and also whats your current rd rate as a percent of sales and how should we think about the stepup function for that for next year gregory a mckelvey  executive vice president chief strategy officer  chief digital officer in regards to misfit and the ip as we talked about earlier this is a unique platform in both cloud and app and then the ability to have an engineering team that really is driving our product platform so its multibrand it connects to the internet of things and communities that our customers care about and basically their lowpower management platform thats built on watch technology andor watch rechargeable – nonrechargeable batteries coin cell fits very well with our roadmap and the technology were trying to bring into our watches laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc thank you very much best of luck dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you just on the question the earlier question our comp was driven more by the outlets which were slightly up the fullpriced stores slightly down operator and that does conclude our questionandanswer session ill turn the call back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks dennis r secor  executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you very much for participating in the call today and we look forward to talking to you after our fourth quarter call in february thank you very much operator that does conclude our conference thank you for
