questions which describe how faculty perceive a rise in the use of rational management strategies on their campuses  strategies originally developed in the business sector  with the effect of putting pressure on more traditional academic values and ways of organizing introduction in the spring of  i conducted a qualitative research study that was the basis of my dissertation titled the commodification of higher education an analysis of faculty members experience in a market driven age the purpose of the study was to describe faculty members’ perceptions of commodification in higher education and to understand the way it plays out in their lives commodification is the process by which social domains and institutions whose concern is not producing commodities in the narrower economic sense of goods for sale come nevertheless to be organized and conceptualized in terms of commodity production distribution and consumption fairclough  p  in higher education institutions and their faculty members become defined in terms of their productive capacity this qualitative study used a case study approach primarily relying on participant interviews to gather the experiences of commodification from  longtime tenured faculty members from three different higher education institutions the institutions from which participants were selected included indiana university at bloomington iub middlebury college and the university of vermont uvm as commodification is largely concerned with being competitive in the market the financial picture of the organization was one concept that guided my site selection among the other salient characteristics of these organizations middlebury college presented a resourcerich private college with a strong liberal arts commitment iub employed the use of a specific budget model on campus resource centered management rcm which parallels the entrepreneurial among other characteristics of the market and uvm at the time of the data collection had ended or so it was hoped a year series of interim leaders had implemented a series of budget reductions and was in the process of redefining itself through a multifaceted strategic planning endeavor what follows is one part of this research largely derived from a dissertation chapter titled the tools of management it describes how faculty perceive a rise in the use of rational management strategies on their campuses strategies originally developed in the business sector with the effect of putting pressure on more traditional academic values and ways of organizing tools of management i have a lot of doubts as to whether you can apply business principles of productivity or cost effectiveness models to the normal functioning of the college or university we don’t have a product or not a product that you can measure in a concrete way middlebury participant in “the  years between  and  the average tuition at public universities increased from  to  and the average tuition at private universities increased from  to ” harvey williams kirshstein omalley  wellman  p  shumar  traces the rising costs of higher education to their structural roots citing dramatic demographic economic and political shifts that resulted in economic highs in the s followed by lows in the s these shifts created a crisis in higher education he argues that typical of capitalism crisis opened the door for tighter control and manipulation “in the service of and subject to market forces” shumar  p  in the wake of these cost increases there has been a trend in the management of academic institutions “toward the adoption of the tools of management originally developed in the business sector” dill  p  organizational downsizing has become educational downsizing under pressure to cut costs manifested in cutbacks layoffs and outsourcing of both service eg janitorial copying maintenance and academic eg online courses functions winner  management strategies to respond to new challenges are drawn from business models including the use of efficiency measures mission statements strategic planning shumar  management by objectives and goalbased planning kuh  whitt  this trend has been described as a rise of “instrumental rationality” on college campuses a method for response to crises and a way to explain institution practices under these circumstances shumar  this narrative describes participants observations as the rise in the use of rational management strategies puts pressure on more traditional academic values and ways of organizing it begins with a section entitled higher education run like a business which illuminates some of the differences between higher education and business such as the values of community and autonomy the next section highlights what stone  identified as the conundrum of competing efficiency goals by examining a common productivity measure in higher education the studenttofaculty ratio the third section focuses on participant observations that cite for the most part an increasing use of numbers to measure aspects of the academy most commonly faculty productivity student outcomes and university rank stone  observed that because the grouping of actions involves inclusion and exclusion likeness may be asserted where there are differences or certain things may be counted excluded this section next examines the ambiguity inherent in numbers followed by uvm facultys experience with a culture of evidence being introduced on campus next a discussion of standardizing workload in the academy is illustrated by middlebury participants and last attention is focused on the use of numbers to compare colleges with one another in the us news and world reports’ college rankings the discussion section raises fundamental questions the answers to which would contribute to predicting what the future holds for campuses with intensified rational management techniques higher education run like a business yes we are in some ways behaving more like a big business but if we can do that to the parts of our institutions that need to be costeffective it frees up our students and our faculty to think good thoughts to learn effectively to provide service to the public i think that’s appropriate middlebury participant with the increasing use of business management tools as a commodifying trend i asked participants what they thought of when they heard the phrase higher education isshould be run like a business  whenever the phrase was used i would find myself thinking of the exception “as a comprehensive university we may have to offer some programs that do not pay for themselves the difference to me is inherent in the definition of commodification higher education is not about making widgets that are bought and sold at the cash register or traded on wall street it is about offering programs not solely dependent on the bottom line hence when some principles from commodity production industries are applied to higher education the fit is just not right this section begins to illuminate the ways that in faculty members’ opinions business tools and styles do and do not suit the academy alternative organizational models blustain  pointed to alternative ways of organizing as a way to frame how higher education differs from business for example imagine universities as preindustrial societies  where  the maximization of profit is not what life’s about instead they are built around a shared moral order based on kinship and community” p  money enables universities to function but the values are community collegiality inquiry and truth outsourcing even if it means cleaner bathrooms tears the fabric of the campus community layoffs even if they save money fracture the moral bonds of paternalism the granting of exclusive pouring rights to cocacola even if it brings in needed revenue violates cherished notions of choice and freedom p  this and other models share the idea that higher education differs from business in its underlying values of community and autonomy its processes for accommodating a variety of constituencies that each have different ideas of efficiency quality and productivity likewise some participants suggested alternative ways of running the institution that are less hierarchical than traditional business models management strategies this language    is sort of vaguely thought or abstractly thought to increase the efficiency of any institution but there doesn’t seem to have been any thought about actually trying to look at how this institution runs and how it could be made more efficient in a problemoriented way middlebury participant i do believe that we as an institution of higher education have a responsibility to be costeffective the ways we go about doing that i think are really important and that we don’t have to do it one way or a traditional way meaning hierarchical topdown management i think that it could be a great opportunity to model mutual respect for everyone in a way that we identify the problems associated with being costeffective and providing quality education uvm participant the first quote suggests looking at the problems within the specific organization and involving whoever wishes to do something about the situation in question the second quote similarly suggests broadening the problemsolver group to include those who have a stake in costs and quality together they align with the value of community in higher education and the tradition of selfgovernance among the faculty against the academic grain i was cautioned early on in my formulation of research questions to be prepared for someone to say but i dont think it is run like a business quickly making my sequence of questions irrelevant but that didnt happen many faculty members felt strongly about financial solvency one participant remarked you can’t run this place without money…if you are in charge of budgets   you need to be responsible i don’t see anything wrong with that that seems to me to be rational and necessary like this participant most would agree that there needs to be financial integrity within the organization objections begin when the purpose of education is stripped of its less tangible features by business strategies the features at risk that are suggested below are all related to notions of selffulfillment and of intellectual and moral growth you can’t view a college simply as a business it’s not simply a business if it doesn’t have any higher purpose of educating people so they will have useful careers and so they will be fulfilled in their careers so they will be happy in their careers so that they will do good for other people i don’t think there is any point in education middlebury participant at the same time this person remarks it is necessary to have   at least some people who are going to go out there   to wall street    and make money and give it back to the institution some felt a business model did not fit with their image of an educational institution one faculty member argued that higher education should be viewed as a professional service organization a public utility as opposed to a capitalist enterprise in which the logic of the market prevails in this respect it has professional knowledge and expertise that it can provide a service to the state and to the nation and to larger international communities   within it professionals have autonomy they set the conditions under which they serve but they have a service ethic the notion is not of marketing but of public relations of community outreach then the student is seen as someone in the trust or care of the university and that if you want to look at it differently you look at it as a nurturing kind of environment maybe but not as one that is meeting necessarily a clientdetermined demand iub participant the traditional values of autonomy in the faculty profession and selfmotivated service to society in the form of transmitting knowledge are felt to be lackingor even under attackin business models accepting the bottom line and cost efficiency beyond accepting the fact that there needs to be financial integrity in a higher education organization participants noted more businesslike practices as the norm a participant at iub acknowledged that there is only so much money and attributed that condition to the type of university when you teach at a state school    there are constraints for others the notion of being bottom line conscious or cost conscious was quite natural a participant from the business discipline described how the logic of efficiency is engrained interacting with people who are “bottom line conscious” everything you do in our profession you think about the allocation of resources to projects and activities that bring some kind of a measurable return   for someone maybe in sociology or philosophy or political science thats not part of their radar screen iub participant some faculty members with experience in managing research dollars also found being efficient with resources a routine part of their activitythey sought to get the most out of a given input one participant remarked on the pressure and necessity of gaining grant dollars as a fact of research life clearly the aspect of having your entire career progression be based on your ability to raise funds    is antithetical to an academic mission but it is also a statement of facts of life that if you are going to do scientific research it costs money to do that participants spoke to the various components of their budgets and constantly tried to sort out where we can spend money most effectively and how another paralleled grant work with business in business if you don’t produce your stock goes down and if we don’t produce our quality goes down competing efficiency goals music is in a real fragile position because all of its performance faculty teach one student at a time you can’t teach mass cello iub participant a studenttofaculty ratio is a common measure of productivity in higher education in this measure the implied objective is to teach the most students for the input namely the faculty resource consequently the more students in a class taught by one instructor the more efficient that unit is with that resource stones  analysis of efficiency goals challenges us to uncover other objectives which if used may lead to a different interpretation of efficiency for example some faculty in this study felt that there are strong pedagogical reasons for smaller class sizes the impact of their teaching is greater with fewer students one remarked i could get to know those students a lot better and give them and their work a lot more attention if i didnt have so many if teaching rests in smaller size classes results in a greater impact then resources might be better spent in mentoring relationships were we to define efficiency in this way it would mean getting fewer students taught for the same resource the tension between these competing definitions of efficiencyteach the most students for the input versus a greater impact of teaching with fewer studentswas most evident at iub iub was the most fertile ground for understanding the competing efficiency goals underlying studenttofaculty ratios this makes sense given the rcm environment in which credithour enrollments drive income to the unit that teaches the student with a budget environment that has teaching the most students as a criterion or measure at its core the faculty although attentive to this goal must balance it with their goals for student learning the following quotes illustrate tradeoffs of traditional academic values when pressure for large class sizes is the goal music is in a real fragile position because all of its performance faculty teach one student at a time you can’t teach mass cello if they have  students which is the normal load it means they are teaching  lessons a week plus a master class so you could hardly expect them to do more than that iub participant you can do a good job with a large lecture class i have no problem with that but when you want students to experience something like doing research and writing it up and having somebody grade it with more than a cursory look at it then the resources are few iub participant when larger classes are a motivation faculty members made note of certain ancillary events two participants said they were told they could not offer smaller classesone by a college dictum and one by the president of the university these experiences begin to encroach on the traditional notion that curriculum is the purview of the faculty another mentioned the lure of providing popular programs to the exclusion of more traditional course offerings like latin which is important if were going to say we are a major university this participant continues i would hate to see them eliminated because theyre not tremendously popular a uvm participant described that sometimes the input side of the equation the faculty resource can influence the output side of the equation the number of students taught uvm is a little different in that    an awful lot of the undergraduate courses are taught by fullfledged tenured faculty that is very costly very expensive so how are you going to fund it you can’t fund it solely on tuition so how are you going to do it well you are going to increase the class size demand higher productivity so instead of teaching classes of  or  you are going to teach classes of  uvm participant the studenttofaculty ratio in this case would be higher with the effect of lowering the input costs faculty resource per student if the same tenured faculty took on more students yet this example also implies that costs per student would be lower if undergraduate teaching were contracted to lowerpaid nontenured faculty or to graduate students as has been the case in many institutions for years numbers to measure the way that the money is now appropriated to the departments is all based on numbers that you generatenot based on what you do or how well you do it uvm participant numbers in a university setting are used among other things to count or measure faculty productivity and student outcomes to provide a basis for resource allocation and to compare universities with one another stone  observed that it is impossible to describe counting without talking about inclusion and exclusion terms that in themselves suggest community boundaries allies and enemies selection a term that implies privilege and discrimination and important characteristics a term that suggests value judgments and hierarchy p  the tensions faculty members relayed with respect to numbers and counting fell within these descriptions and were typically in conflict with what were perceived as traditional academic pursuits measures that exclude stone  asserts that because counting involves inclusion and exclusion real likenesses may be emphasized over differences the notion that standard measures could be applied across the academy was challenged by participants faculty members from iub offered several examples in which the apparent uniformity that numbers emphasized simply was not the case one participant described a multidiscipline groupgenerated set of counting criteria that was to be applied to all disciplines within a college with its focus on research published articles were counted in the measure but published books were not with its application to a discipline that was considered both a humanity and a science not recognizing published books meant that half of ones productivity simply doesn’t count similarly some disciplines provide service courses primarily and have no student majors with student majors as a predominant group measured in assessing student outcomes those disciplines without majors can be at a disadvantage a third example was cited when undergraduate teaching is the standard by which effort on graduate education is compared here one participant remarked there is an expectation of graduate teachingbut that is done on our own it is factored into the teaching load but in terms of numbers of students that faculty ought to be teaching it really isn’t i mean i am on  dissertation committees and that doesn’t count anywhere iub participant however this participant had learned how to work the system to hisher advantage effort that used to be offered to students on an individual basis in individual reading seminars and consequently not counted has now been turned into a course that will at least have a number so that students can register up until then those had been sort of free in her article “nurturing an engaged university” then uvm president judith ramaley described a need to incorporate broader definitions of scholarly work into what is now accepted as scholarly legitimacy  p  she stated broadening the concepts of scholarly work will be extremely difficult unless a campus devises credible and effective ways to document and evaluate all forms of scholarship and a broad range of pedagogies p  although this is the past president of uvm writing this values barrier was also illustrated by an iub participant when people talk about research productivity it means the number of dollars you bring in well how do you measure research productivity in an area like philosophy or history or    education well people don’t generally go out and get large grants in this area…i am one of the leading scholars in my field   but i don’t bring any money into the university with me    my colleagues are some of the most distinguished scholars in their fields and they are not bringing in money so this whole notion of the bottom line as even a measure of scholarly productivity this starts the whole notion of how you define creativity and productivity and it’s not tied to dollars iub participant it is worth noting that almost all of the participants who pointed out these difficulties with using numbers to measure were from the softer sciences one remarked the measures for the most part were quantitative could be added up so that you got a score stone  lent some perspective to this frustration although numbers have a preeminent status in our scientific culture measuring is only one way to describe literature describes with words painting with pigments and brush strokes and measurement with numbers p  for those who are excluded or counted out there is a need to redefine the measures or get around traditional barriers by recognizing other descriptive and evaluative modes standards of measure the teaching load at middlebury college was well known by each participant and quick to be recited a standard load is three courses in one semester two courses in the other and every other year a winterterm course is included departments with comparatively few majors have over time been allocated greater proportions of service courses in the firstyear seminar program however a department was not being allocated more service courses because they were less valued rather this strategy for evening out workload was commonly presented in terms of equity across campus what was the fairest distribution middlebury participant although the workload formula seemed to be applied uniformly across campus it was not without some difficulty particularly for the languages and sciences one problem was that course preparations and labs differed in the effort they required of faculty members and they were generally difficult to standardize for courses with growing enrollments another concern was that once you reach a certain threshold a course can’t count for any more and all our courses are going from beyond that threshold to way way way beyond that threshold middlebury participant it was also stated that some courses should not be large lectures and trying to do so may interfere with pedagogy for example teaching contemporary moral issues with a lot of students just does not work middlebury participant stone  asserted counting of any sort is a complex mental process but measurement    is a complex social process as well nothing like counting up piles of peas and beans p  the experience of one middlebury participant on how numbers were used in decision making exemplifies the contemplation necessary in social and political settings for applying such criteria the numbers guy had full accounts of how far short wed fallen…but he was pretty scrupulously fair on all the numbers i think if there was something like this  enrollment criterion but we were only getting  he wasnt actually going to start striking things off middlebury participant stone  continued in political environments numbers are subject to conscious and unconscious manipulation by the people being measured the people taking the measurements and the people who interpret and use measures made by others p  although the word manipulation is extreme the point is that the measurer added his discretion when identified thresholds were involved counting instructional workload is just one component of a broader issue of gauging faculty productivity in a political environment the question of whether a phenomenon is measurable at all is often raised stone  p  this challenge was illustrated by a participant from middlebury although the productivity issue    has come up once or twice in discussions between faculty members and trustees discussions among trustees discussions among administrators the dimensions have yet to be defined whenever it has come up it has led to some discussion and then finally to people shrugging their shoulders in despair at ever finding any kind of measurement of productivity for college professors ambiguity in numbers another theme that emerged was the ambiguity of numbers the same number can mean different things to different people depending on ones perspective or in what forum they are used a familiar illustration of this concept in higher education organizations is in the yearend balancing of budgets to a unit a large balance could mean prudent use of funds whereas to central administrators that balance could mean a unit had too much money to begin with similar conundrums were illustrated by middlebury participants on the subject of student success and student outcomes with implications for the quality of the education a common measure for assessing the education provided to students is looking at where they go after they complete their undergraduate education for many schools numbers that demonstrate a high percentage of graduates going on to get phds would be a positive indicator of success at middlebury such indicators can have a “double edge” depending on the meaning behind the measure if the measure means that students are furthering their education and will produce more scholarship that is good if the measure means those students will gain job security or economic success it gets a chillier reception as a faculty member describes in this next quote “when measures have a double meaning the people being measured are put in a double bind” some of our less than understanding colleagues across campus have this vision that we are some kind of technical training center as opposed to a    department in a liberal arts institution which is how we pattern our courses   if we say well we need this so we can get more students into good    grad schools that actually is negative and if our graduates werent going to grad school some would see it as a positive on this campus…it reaches a point where in certain places we don’t brag about what our students are going to middlebury participant thus depending on how the numbers are perceived it is good to be high on the measure but also good to be low stone  p  this participants double bind was that students’ success in attaining advanced degrees meant they would have a leg up on the job market but the high percentage of students prepared for a job had a poor reception in a liberal arts tradition that did not see a utilitarian mission as the primary goal of education another measure for assessing the education provided to students is documenting their careers once they have left departments one faculty member objected primarily on the grounds that the commonly sought indicatorsalary levelshould not be a student outcome measure moreover this would be a poor measure for making resource decisions in the middlebury environment it seems patently obvious to me that the economics department is likely to be producing graduates who are going to have the highest incomes or the political science department but that…would seem to me a very bad reason for the college to say “well we should put more money into those departments”    develop those departments as opposed to others that may be producing school teachers or social workers middlebury participant this example too has a double edge but more at the institutional level than the individual level seeking information of this kind may go against established educational values but it also has the practical purpose of keeping the institution afloat it is also an example of a contradiction facing higher education brought on by commodification what could have been a measure of personal fulfillmentthe foundation for participation in a democratic societyis also being valued for its ability to be translated into cash shumar  p both for the individual in terms of salary and the institution in terms of bolstering its endowment a culture of evidence signs of being engaged in a competitive market driven academic environment are competing for quality students and faculty declining financial support and competing for social prestige dill  p  in a market model resources go to the people who can use them to the greatest productive advantage or who will derive the greatest amount of welfare from them stone  p  stone states that allocations signal the direction of resources to their best use p  consistent with market models as a means for determining best use the culture of evidence introduced at the time at uvm was one that participants cited would drive an increase in the use of numbers on campus one participant felt that using numbers to measure was already too prevalent in decision making and in some cases detrimental to creative academic pursuits since i came to uvm there has been a much closer look at productivity in terms of its faculty than it used to be back in the s   as a faculty member the whole thing here is just how much can you turn out what is our productivity level how many publications how many grants did you write how many advisees how many undergraduates have been working with you this semester how many graduates how many phd’s have you turned out everything is numbers and i think what it has usurped over the years is creative thinking time to think uvm participant there is irony in this participants objection to increased rational management tools in academia because they inhibit creativity since these were the same concerns some corporations had in the earlier th century shumar  cited nobles  observation of the time many corporations discovered that the rationality of the business environment had a stifling effect on creativity p  and consequently many businesses moved their research endeavors away from corporate headquarters to protect them from growing commodification in their environments some participants however perceive that numbers were not being used to inform decision making and felt their absence as available information was reflective of fundamentally irresponsible management if we start to measure and we tighten things up and try to run it like a business either as cost centers or profit centers we start to turn the sunshine on and start to say “where is this money going and are we getting value for the money that is being spent” everything is going down through this black hole    let’s live and behave the way that we teachand that is the scientific method we collect data we collect evidence and we make decisions this participant continued that where data were or could be available it had been ignored or obfuscated in the struggle for resources now when data are expected as a component to decision making faculty members are less than receptive we get very sanctimonious and we say “we are jeopardizing the quality and the reputation of this fine school and we would like the central administration to take that on face value and say “oh my how could we possibly have overlooked this here please take these bags of money and go forth well where is the evidence that this is the case college rankings us news and world report is one wellknown publication that uses numbers to rank colleges for academic excellence its rankings are derived from indexes organized under the broad categories of academic reputation student retention faculty resources student selectivity financial resources graduation rate performance and alumni giving rates the factors are weighted by us news and world reports’ assessment of the relative importance of each measure and a total weighted score is calculated for college rank morse  flanigan  during middlebury college’s year celebration a panel discussion planned around the theme selling the ivory tower provided an opportunity for the community to engage in dialogue on the increasingly commoditized environment in which liberal arts colleges operate college rankings were recognized for the influence they have on the education market and student choice in that discussion a brief anecdote was conveyed about college rankings an unnamed college recently dropped the sats as a criterion for admission consequently the college received more applicants denied a greater percentage of them and looked more “selective” in the process thus it was argued that the integrity of such measures were questionable when the numbers could be manipulated without real changes in the education offered quinn durden and marcus et al  in the same way some participants from middlebury and iub questioned the integrity of the us news and world reports’ rankings and conveyed the meaning that such measures held for them at middlebury one participant was disturbed by a variety of issues invoked with rankings first this participant was disturbed by the stock parents students and guidance counselors placed in an institutions position in us news and world reports’ rankings it “is really a piss poor way of judging colleges laughter” second the measure itself is troubling because it is not sensitive enough to reflect recent academic improvements academically this is a much better college than it was  years ago but if you were to look at us news and world rankings we are stuck in a rut as far as academic ranking is concerned in every other respect this college has skyrocketed but    to change academic reputation to some extent is to change a culture and that is very difficult and then to convince people outside of here that you have changed the culture is even harder middlebury participant this participant’s impression is consistent with how the ratings work and makes a statement about where the measure places value us news and world reports’ “ranking formula gives greatest weight  to reputation because a degree from a distinguished college so clearly helps graduates get good jobs” morse  flanigan  par  as earlier stated at iub where resources are closely tied to enrollments the departments being measured are in a “double bind” this time the double bind emerges between the budget model and the ranking system everyone is sort of trying to survive on how many students you are getting    while you get hurt because your ratio of rejections is not high enough it was felt that the rcm budget model which heightens pressure to bring in more students and produce a lot of student credit hours is in conflict with college rankings that value a high rejection ratio as an indicator of excellence when a participant earlier charged that changing the ranking is as hard as changing the culture it may have opened the door to seeing rankings on a different dimension stone  urged rankings are numbers they are no more real or as real as poems and paintings that are collected recited and displayed p  as a painting is an artifact of culture so too are numbers but the dominance of numbers as a mode of describing society    is only a recent and perhaps temporary phenomenon in cultural historynot the result of some underlying reality of numbers stone  p  discussion running the academy like a business may intensify application of the notion of efficiency and use of numbers to measure faculty work and further erode traditional values and ways of organizing of the questions this trend raises for the academy and its faculty i find two trends particularly fundamental to knowing what the future may hold for higher education with intensified businesslike practices the first centers on the notion that higher education differs from business in its underlying values of community and autonomy but it is the value of community i focus on here one participant suggested that in certain aspects of the academy particularly what is nonacademic in nature it is appropriate to behave like a business because it frees up resources for faculty and students to do their work this struck me in a way as further tearing the fabric of higher education where the community is somewhat less because a function of the broader organization is outsourced the idea raises the question who is the community is it only tenured faculty or fulltime faculty or faculty with parttime status of any rank does the community exclude administrators who often straddle administrative and faculty camps or professional staff or support staff how much can you lop off before you no longer have a community and conversely if narrowing the community is behaving like a business then we must recognize we are embracing business practices in doing so it seems to me a slippery slope but what is meant by community will continue to be challenged by intensified rational management a second question comes out of the efficiency discussion and the tradeoff of class size with the impact of teaching although i support proper pedagogy for learning i feel that frequent retorts suggesting quality will be eroded or pedagogy sacrificed by larger class sizes are becoming hollow by lack of demonstration or casual use of this claim i agree with those for example levine and harvey et al  who articulate the irony that in an industry based on critical reflection and knowledge creation people too often make assertions without the evidence to back their claims quality is like creativity a difficult concept to demonstrate particularly to a public that is increasingly tuned into numbers however many of higher educations stakeholders have accepted business principles as the norm consequently we must own the dilemma of how to present qualitative less tangible concepts to the rational majority the question is how are we going to do it
