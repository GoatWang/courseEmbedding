become friends for life some of my closest friends came from hills bank and i am eternally grateful for that they also pay their parttime employees very well a great place to work while going to schoolconsthe reason you create such good relationship with your coworkers is because you all have something in common you are all going through the ridiculous tasks customers and management is making you do i understand customer service is important but when i have been drilled to do something a certain way and you tell a customer no they freak out after that those customers go and complain to management saying this is the last time we will do this for you but it never is these are then the people who will be grading you on your performance which effects everyones pay raises and bonuseshills also will not write you recommendation letters or provide referrals once you are prepared to get a job in the real world getting a degree then going to work at hills is completely irrelevant because to them the amount of time you have been there is better than your knowledge on how things actually are suppose to work they claim they wont write references because they dont want to lose good employees but they dont treat their good employees good at all but why would you stay when you walk in there with a finance or accounting degree and they would say okay you can be a teller and have to work your way upi think there is a chance that every teller supervisor that i have at least encountered have some form of a mood disorder you never know what supervisor you are encountering when you walk into the office that day even though hard workers will leave a branch because of a certain teller supervisor and many of them have at the nl zeller branch and the cv branch they wont do anything about itadvice to managementremember that students fulltime job is being a student and respect that fact dont try and con them into working  hours and never giving them time off during finals also please remember that treating your tellers well is sometimes more important than making a customer happy thats probably why you have so much turnover and no one wanting to work

ceoi worked at hills bank  trust co parttime more than a yearprosthe people you meet can easily become friends for life some of my closest friends came from hills bank and i am eternally grateful for that they also pay their parttime employees very well a great place to work while going to schoolconsthe reason you create such good relationship with your coworkers is because you all have something in common you are all going through the ridiculous tasks customers and management is making you do i understand customer service is important but when i have been drilled to do something a certain way and you tell a customer no they freak out after that those customers go and complain to management saying this is the last time we will do this for you but it never is these are then the people who will be grading you on your performance which effects everyones pay raises and bonuseshills also will not write you recommendation letters or provide referrals once you are prepared to get a job in the real world getting a degree then going to work at hills is completely irrelevant because to them the amount of time you have been there is better than your knowledge on how things actually are suppose to work they claim they wont write references because they dont want to lose good employees but they dont treat their good employees good at all but why would you stay when you walk in there with a finance or accounting degree and they would say okay you can be a teller and have to work your way upi think there is a chance that every teller supervisor that i have at least encountered have some form of a mood disorder you never know what supervisor you are encountering when you walk into the office that day even though hard workers will leave a branch because of a certain teller supervisor and many of them have at the nl zeller branch and the cv branch they wont do anything about itadvice to managementremember that students fulltime job is being a student and respect that fact dont try and con them into working  hours and never giving them time off during finals also please remember that treating your tellers well is sometimes more important than making a customer happy thats probably why you have so much turnover and no one wanting to work their way upshare on facebookshare on twittershare on whatsappshare via emailcopy linklink copiedflag as inappropriateflag
