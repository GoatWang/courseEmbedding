even being right  or  times out of  should yield a person a fortune if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly on the ventures where he is wrong don’t try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top it can’t be done except by liars bernard baruch my own story  from time to time we like to recount the stories of exceptional speculators and investors most of us have an interest in creating wealth for ourselves and for our families and studying the investment approach and methods of hugely successful speculators and investors can be not only absorbing reading but also highly instructive bernard baruch was one such remarkably successful speculator like jesse livermore about whom we wrote in  baruch had no capital to start with yet he managed to build a large fortune through his wits — his ability to understand people gauge risk properly and gamble successfully but unlike jesse livermore baruch was both a hugely successful speculator as well as a financier philanthropist and close advisor to several us presidents he led an exemplary life and died a greatly admired elder statesman at the ripe old age of  early life baruch was born to an upper middle class jewish family living in camden south carolina in  the name baruch has a great jewish heritage as it means “blessed” in hebrew and the book of baruch is a book in the apocrypha in the old testament bernard was the second of four boys his mother belle wolfe traced her american lineage back to the s his father was a physician and had come to the united states at the age of fifteen to avoid conscription into the prussian army befriended by his sole contact in america mannes baum he went to medical college in charleston and later to another medical school in richmond and upon the outbreak of the civil war he enlisted in the confederate army as a battlefield surgeon he saw the saddest and most grisly side of the war and in his duties was captured by union forces several times but always treated kindly and exchanged for union physicians captured by the confederates after the war with the south still suffering from its defeat his father finding it difficult to make a living moved the family to new york city bernard was enrolled in ps  on th street and was a good student so good in fact that he enrolled in the city college of new york at the age of  ccny was a college where a boy could get a good liberal arts education free the curriculum included latin and greek and students were expected to deliver a “declamation” at assembly — a recital of prose or poetry and as a junior and senior to give an “oration” written for the occasion there were few electives later when baruch was a trustee of the college he fought to maintain this kind of classical education at ccny but to no avail he graduated at the age of  and had an adventurous spirit at the age of  baruch traveled with a friend to seek his fortune in the silver and gold mines of cripple creek colorado after working as a mucker and driller in a silver mine for some months and spending money rather than accumulating wealth he returned to new york where his mother who moved in upper class jewish circles used her contacts to introduce him to a wall street broker who gave him a job he was employed as an office boy and runner at  a week — a salary which thrilled him learning the ropes on wall street after working for a few years as a clerk at the wall street brokerage firm aa housman baruch accumulated a modest amount of capital and began to speculate on margin in the late th century one only had to put up  of the price of the purchase unlike the  that is needed today baruch speculated primarily in railroads in receivership and industrials in the s the railroad industry was going through a major consolidation after several decades of overexpansion railroads were the equivalent of social media stocks today railroads were where the action was in these early learning years baruch would often make successful trades but as he pyramided his holdings adding shares via margin as the price rose he would be wiped out including his original capital when the stock retrenched he lost not only all of his capital repeatedly but also some of his father’s capital as well rather than despairing of his losses he began a habit which all investors should do — analyzing his losses to determine his mistakes usually his mistakes came in two categories  insufficient knowledge of the securities in which he was dealing  overleveraging his positions so that when a stock pulled back modestly his capital would be wiped out after four years of trading he had accumulated very little but he did persuade arthur housman to make him a junior partner in the firm at the age of  he received an equity interest in the firm marriage plans lead to maturity in  his first full year as a partner baruch’s share of the profits was  — a great deal of money in those days this was a godsend to baruch as he was courting annie griffen her father was not in favor of the courtship believing that the difference in their religions would prove an insurmountable barrier to their happiness her mother was more positively inclined at the same time baruch made his first killing in the stock market he did it by taking a position in american sugar refining a company which baruch had thoroughly analyzed the action in the stock was influenced primarily by whether congress would act to lower the tariffs on sugar thereby dramatically reducing the profits of american sugar baruch correctly wagered that the high tariff would be maintained and as the stock climbed baruch bought more and more when he liquidated his position his profits were  — the equivalent of  million today with these funds in hand annie griffen consented to marry him defying the wishes of her father who declined to attend his daughter’s wedding in time though her father was won over baruch and his wife later agreed to raise their two daughters in the christian church and let their son choose his faith in his autobiography baruch writes with great magnanimity about the discrimination that he and his family faced from time to time for example his daughters were not accepted at the same private girls’ school in new york that their mother an episcopalian had attended baruch writes in his autobiography my own story “above all i have told my children not to be blind to the greatness of america by the pettiness of some of the people in it the men who wrote the declaration of independence were wise in this regard when they came to define what they conceived as man’s inalienable rights they chose the words carefully — ‘life liberty and the pursuit of happiness’ not ‘happiness’ but the ‘pursuit of happiness’ they made no promise of utopia they promised only the opportunity to better one’s living … the priceless heritage which america has given us — the heritage which is america — is this opportunity of being able to better oneself through one’s own striving no form of government can give a person more than that” key events in the life of bernard baruch  born in camden south carolina  his father formerly a physician in the confederate army moved the family to new york city  entered the city college of new york at the age of   first job on wall street as an office boy and runner at  a week  worked as a mucker in a silver mine in cripple creek colorado later joined a wall street brokerage firm as a clerk office boy and runner at  a week  became junior partner in wall street firm aa housman and earned  his first year equivalent of  today  speculation in american sugar refining netted   million today  managed his first stock pool in the acquisition of liggett  myers tobacco company earning equivalent of  million in  dollars  made a big profit in eh harriman – jp morgan battle for control of northern pacific railway through shorting the market  net worth of  million  million in current dollars  opened his own brokerage house  most profitable deal of his career — texas gulf sulphur  appointed chairman of the war industries board by president wilson  served on president wilson’s staff at paris peace conference  acted to mitigate his friend winston churchill’s stock market losses  became a member of president roosevelt’s “brain trust” and roosevelt’s trusted friend and advisor  appointed advisor to war mobilization board by president roosevelt  appointed by president truman to united nations atomic energy commission where baruch proposed “baruch plan” to control use of atomic energy  died at age  becoming a millionaire by his late twenties baruch was already recognized as a man with uncommonly good financial judgment and perhaps more importantly a man who kept his word and could be trusted when baruch opened his own brokerage firm his father gave him a photograph of himself inscribed with these words “let unswerving integrity always be your watchword” and baruch in his life stayed true to this exhortation thus at the age of  baruch was engaged to advise liggett  myers tobacco company’s shareholders and manage a stock pool to help them fend off duke tobacco and enhance their market share in the lucrative cigarette market he succeeded brilliantly and earned a great deal of money in  eh harriman and jp morgan were in a fierce duel for control of the northern pacific railway there is not time to elaborate on this battle which involved a corner in northern pacific stock and was the cause of the panic of  other than to state that baruch kept his head and while many were ruined he made a very large profit by shorting stocks and then covering his shorts at the appropriate moment from  to  baruch parlayed his capital of  into  million the equivalent of  million today having already bought a seat on the new york stock exchange he opened his own brokerage firm in  and over the coming years became known as the “lone wolf of wall street” because he typically kept his own counsel he was famous for abhorring tips writing in his autobiography “beware…of anyone bringing gifts of ‘inside’ information or ‘tips’” his modus operandi of avoiding those peddling inside information occurred decades before the securities and exchange commission which was formed in  outlawed trading securities on the basis of inside information in  he became involved in the most profitable deal of his entire career — the creation of what came to be known as the texas gulf sulphur company as he typically did baruch immersed himself in the facts and figures of the world sulphur trade and came to the conclusion that america’s rapid economic growth would require the development of the sulphur industry in the us previously the island of sicily was the source of  of the world’s sulphur the patent on the frasch process for extracting sulphur the only economic method of recovering sulphur from elemental deposits expired in  and could be used to mine the major deposit that they were investigating in texas in discussions with jp morgan about the deal baruch inadvertently used the word “gamble” to describe the potential investment in the sulphur industry and jp morgan immediately said that he was not interested as he did not “gamble” later baruch famously wrote “still the truth is there is no investment which does not involve some risk and is not something of a gamble” baruch went on to invest a sizable amount of money in what became texas gulf sulphur making more than twentyfold on his investment during the period before world war i baruch also made investments in gold mines and companies producing key commodities such as copper and rubber he rarely if ever lost money on these investments statesman and presidential advisor during world war i as it looked increasingly as if america might have to join the allied war effort president woodrow wilson appointed baruch a great patriot to the advisory commission of the council of national defense when america entered the war in  he became chairman of the council in  baruch was a member of the supreme economic council at the versailles peace conference and a personal advisor to president wilson on the terms of peace he counseled against the draconian reparations required of germany and italy as an expert in wartime economic mobilization he was employed as an advisor to president franklin roosevelt during world war ii baruch became one of roosevelt’s trusted friends and in april  an exhausted president roosevelt journeyed to baruch’s acre plantation in south carolina hobcaw barony where he spent a month with baruch during which time he tried to recuperate from the stress of directing the american war effort president harry s truman also appointed baruch to the un atomic energy commission in  another great statesman winston churchill considered baruch a great friend baruch visited churchill on numerous occasions at chartwell and baruch reciprocated this hospitality whenever churchill visited america in  during the stock market crash baruch mitigated churchill’s significant losses by buying some of the shares that churchill was shorting and shorting the shares he was buying altogether he transferred  about  in today’s dollars to churchill to help counter churchill’s inept speculation speculating in securities in my own story baruch writes “i have defined a speculator as a man who observes the future and acts before it occurs” the dictionary defines speculation as “engaging in risky business transactions on the chance of a quick or considerable profit” speculation in the capital markets typically involves a willingness both to buy and short securities using significant debt margin pyramiding positions in securities is very risky and can often lead to the complete loss of principal this happened over and over again in baruch’s youth gradually baruch learned that successful speculation was not just shooting in the dark but rather involved assembling all of the facts of a situation or an opportunity and then forming a correct judgment on the opportunity finally it meant acting in a timely fashion before it was too late baruch gives as an example of timely action the steps he took upon learning over a july th weekend of the us navy’s destruction of the spanish fleet at santiago during the spanishamerican war rather than waiting until the stock market opened on monday he hired a special train to take him to new york sunday evening before dawn monday morning baruch bought stocks on the london market at good prices and sold them later that day in new york at a sizable profit baruch’s ten rules of successful speculation don’t speculate unless you can make it a fulltime job beware of barbers beauticians waiters — of anyone — bringing gifts of “inside” information or “tips” before you buy a security find out everything you can about the company its management and competitors its earnings and possibilities for growth don’t try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top this can’t be done — except by liars learn how to take your losses quickly and cleanly don’t expect to be right all the time if you have made a mistake cut your losses as quickly as possible don’t buy too many securities better have only a few investments which can be watched make a periodic reappraisal of all your investments to see whether changing developments have altered their prospects study your tax position to know when you can sell to greatest advantage always keep a good part of your capital in a cash reserve never invest all your funds don’t try to be a jack of all investments stick to the field you know best in addition to these trading principles baruch mentions several other key rules about speculation in his autobiography he cautioned against averaging down although admitting that an investor might occasionally buy stocks at lower prices than their original purchase if the fundamentals justify it he also wrote about how to preserve capital in a severe bear market or a panic baruch writes “value in an investment is like character in an individual it stands up better in adversity and overcomes adversity readily” this is a core principle in the investment approach of bradley foster  sargent inc capital is best preserved in a bear market by owning stocks in quality companies with good brands strong balance sheets robust cash flow and excellent management teams as they usually emerge stronger after a recession baruch also emphasizes that the time when really big money can be made in the stock market is when the economy emerges from a recession finally he warns that stock market participants should be on their guard whenever the term “new era” is being bandied about he maintains that it is usually the sign of extravagant hopes and an overheated market this still rings true as during the internet bubble at the end of the last century one heard a great deal about the “new era” that we were in and between the top of the market in early  and the bottom in late  the nasdaq composite was down  summary as we have written in other commentaries investing in stocks is very different than speculating in stocks investing in stocks involves the commitment of money in order to create appreciation of capital and growth of income over the longer term speculation in stocks primarily involves the goal of quick and large profits through methods which involve the significant risk of losing much or all of one’s capital rather than focusing on speculating in the short term investors know that the longterm trend of stock prices in the us has been up — with the total return of the sp  index achieving an average annual return of approximately  since  the dow jones has shown an increase of  fold appreciating from  in  to  at the close of  thus investors seek to invest in stocks for the long haul rather than holding cash for much of the time and then making quick forays into the market in the hopes of making a killing based on shortterm trading in closing it should be noted that most professional investors do in fact follow a number of bernard baruch’s trading rules for example it is wise to sell your losers quickly and let your winners run or as famed fidelity mutual fund manager peter lynch wrote “water your flowers and pull out your weeds” generally when an investor buys a stock that goes down and then holds it the temptation is great to sell it if and when it gets back to breakeven thus generating no profit from the trade it is also imperative to learn everything one can before buying a security in a company periodically reappraising one’s holdings is also a vital discipline at bradley foster  sargent we are investors not speculators and since our inception nearly  years ago our investment approach of investing in quality stocks for the long haul with careful attention to risk has served to preserve our clients’ capital in times of economic adversity and increase it in times of prosperity and like baruch’s father we believe that integrity should always be our watchword quarterly commentary current quarterly commentaryarchive of past commentaries
