end funds unlike open end funds are not continuously offered there is a one time public offering and once issued shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market there is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective like any stock a closed end funds share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors at the time of sale your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment accordingly it is possible to lose money investing in the trust as the fund approaches its termination date the fund may earn interest income at a more modest rate as a result the funds distributions during the winddown period of approximately three to twelve months preceding the termination date may consist in whole or in part of a return of capital cmbs differ from conventional debt securities because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at maturity cmbs are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that a borrower’s payments may be received earlier than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of cmbs and will result in losses to the fund junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality the values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods because the assets of the fund will be liquidated in connection with its termination the fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when it otherwise would not including at times when market conditions are not favorable or at a time when a particular security is in default or bankruptcy or otherwise in severe distress which may cause the fund to lose money the fund’s anticipated use of leverage by issuing preferred shares and other senior debt securities creates special risks for common shareholders including potential interest rate risks and the likelihood of greater volatility of nav and

invesco advisers inc invesco ivz announced today that invesco high income  target term fund the fund has entered into a commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs repurchase facility the facility  the fund anticipates using the facility as a form of leverage to seek to enhance its potential to produce a high level of current income and to return  per share to common shareholders on or about december   the funds termination date  the facility will permit the fund to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions in which the fund will receive cash and will transfer cmbs to a bank in exchange for a simultaneous agreement by the bank to sell the cmbs back to the fund at a future date resulting in the fund having access to additional cash to invest while maintaining its portfolio of investments the facility will expose the fund to interest rate risk including the risk associated with financing fixed rate instruments with floating rate debt  an increase in prevailing interest rates will result in increased costs associated with using the facility  additionally the use of leverage such as the facility creates additional risks for common shareholders including increased variability of the funds net asset value net income and distributions in relation to market changes  in particular leverage increases the risk of price volatility the funds use of leverage may not work as planned or achieve its goals  both the anticipated amount of leverage utilized by the fund and the costs of leverage associated with the facility are projected to be lower than was expected at the funds launch invesco believes that by entering into the facility invesco ivz will enhance its ability to manage the funds portfolio in the best interests of shareholders and to meet the funds
