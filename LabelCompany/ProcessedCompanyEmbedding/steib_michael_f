discussed throughout the year we committed in  to drive stronger longterm financial performance for our shareholders by focusing our company investing in talent and delivering great products in my first year as ceo we have achieved these initial goals and successfully transformed the knot into a wedding vendor marketplace all while continuing to grow our core revenue and generate healthy cash flow we focused this year by exiting noncore businesses like our ijie and wedding supplies fulfillment operations and consolidating a number of ancillary websites and offices these efforts ensure that we focus our attention on only businesses in which we can be best in class and that are positioned to deliver value for our shareholders weve brought in even more exceptional talent in product mobile development open source engineering and business execution  of the leadership team here at xo has joined within the last  months bringing new perspectives and a renewed spirit to the entire organization in addition we strengthened our board of directors and taken further steps to ensure good corporate governance we have now replaced every priority app and website in the company with new bestinclass products our new apps have significantly increased our mobile sessions and have driven x the engagement with our vendors compared to our legacy websites and in the last few weeks we launched completely rebuilt sites for the knot and the bump that incorporate all of the great features from our apps providing a seamless experience for our couples across devices these products are increasing engagement between our couples and vendors driving more business to the vendors in our marketplace and putting us on a path for future growth we believe our knot wedding vendors marketplace is a significant growth opportunity for us a successful marketplace engages its users matches them to relevant vendors and facilitates connections between the two in  we did a better job of engaging our couples as demonstrated for instance by our growth in unique visitors the knot has grown by  and is larger than our three largest competitors combined we also improved the matching process between our couples and vendors by providing a more personalized experience in our mobile products adding more than  vendor listings and significantly increasing our usergenerated reviews on theknotcom these improvements have contributed to our record low churn rates and strong top line financial results for our local online business in  in our wedding vendor marketplace look for us to continue to share with you our progress as we increase engagement better match our couples and vendors and further facilitate and monetize the connection between the two for the bump we completely rearchitected our mobile applications shifting from a portal experience to a feed of relevant content community and tools personalized to the age and stage of the pregnancy and baby our team also delivered strong revenue results growing bump national online by  our new bump website launched last month should mark the beginning of an exciting year for this promising brand its been a good year and theres still a lot of hard work ahead we have ambitious longterm goals for both our wedding vendor marketplace and our bump brand for our marketplace we will know we have succeeded when we have inspired planned and booked every wedding in america with the bump we want to be the only source parents turn to for all things pregnancy and baby anytime anywhere i want to thank our fellow shareholders for all of their support throughout  and our employees for all of their hard work and dedication with that ill turn it over to gillian for the financial review thanks guys gillian munson  chief financial officer thanks mike weve got a lot to cover on this call so im going to break it down into about three parts first im going to provide you detail on our gaap q results and the items included in those results and track comparability i will then walk you through our nongaap operating results we believe more accurately represent our cooperation and finally ill give you some color how we are thinking about  our reported gaap loss per share for q was  as outlined in our press release issued earlier today this compares to a loss of  in the year ago quarter in our release we laid out a detailed list of the items that impact comparability in our gaap results for both q and full year  if you exclude these items during the fourth quarter our nongaap eps were  up from  a year ago its been a year of change at xo and as a result our q gaap results include a number of charges related to transitions in our businesses these largely fall into three areas first we posted a  million pretax charge related to the exit of our ijie operations of note our initial estimate for the total cost associated with this exit was  million pretax as we worked through the particulars of the winddown our total costs came in at the  million pretax level as i just mentioned and we had  million in incremental taxes bringing the total to  million including tax secondly we incurred charges related to the shutdown of our wedding supplies fulfillment operations in the amount of  during the quarter this represents severance and asset impairments we are on track to finalize the shutdown by the end of q our initial estimate for the total cost of our wedding supplies shutdown was  million to  million we are updating that estimate now to be in the  million to  million range the change in estimate is due to the amazing work of our redding california team who were able to monetize inventory at a better rate than we previously forecasted third we incurred charges related to our separation with david liu and carley roney who transitioned to nonmanagement roles at the end of  this was in the amount of  from here forward ill predominantly stick to operating results which exclude the items i just mentioned unless specifically called out for a reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the relevant gaap financial measure please see the reconciliation table included in our investor presentation which was released prior to the start of this conference call total revenue for the fourth quarter was  million up  yearoveryear and up  if you exclude merchandise looking at our revenue lines individually local online which is roughly  of our total revenue increased  yearoveryear our local enterprise team led by kristin savilia has done a great job of staying focused on growing the top line as we expand the marketplace features of this business our national team had an excellent q national online which is  of our revenue increased  yearoveryear in the fourth quarter the increase was driven by good sales execution on both our baby and wedding properties jennifer garrett the leader of our national enterprise group focused the sales team on big advertising deals and they were able to attract key new clients and grow average ttms  on both the knot and the bump publishing and other revenue grew  yearoveryear primarily driven by increases in our national publication and our registry services revenue increased  in q our results in ecommerce reflect the decision made to shut down our wedding merchandise fulfillment operations by the end of q fourth quarter revenue increased  yearoveryear driven by increased promotions as we clear inventory in advance of our shutdown id note this revenue growth came at low clearing level gross margins of  overall gross margin increased to  from  a year ago driven by increases in our higher margin advertising businesses partly offset by the merchandising margin i mentioned before we continue to benefit from a mix shift to digital in our revenue line given our transition we watch gross margin dollar growth closely in q it grew  slightly faster than revenue which is an encouraging trend total operating expenses were  million up  yearoveryear this growth rate was lower than the gross margin dollar growth rate giving us eps growth yearoveryear when you look at opex growth versus gross margin dollar growth on an annual basis you will see the investment we have made in our business to fuel our transformation in the interest of quantifying the impact of that investment we have estimated that any spending over  yearoveryear for the year  was incremental and using that framework total incremental spending for the full year was roughly  million looking at our total operating expenses for the quarter product and content grew  yearoveryear this is a moderation in our yeartoyear growth rate due to slower than expected hiring in the quarter sales and marketing increased  yearoveryear driven by higher compensation expense associated with the strong advertising results for the quarter and ga grew a moderate  yearoveryear stockbased compensation for the quarter was  million down  yearoveryear due to the executive changes we made during the year depreciation and amortization was  million in the quarter up  yearoveryear the growth was driven by typical increases in amortization related to product  releases and the previously announced acceleration of our weddingchannel trade name amortization q was the last quarter of this accelerated expense which totaled  million for the year id like to pause here to mention our tax line as you can see in our gaap results we had a high tax rates during both the quarter and the year a normal effective tax rate for us should be in the  to  range if you assume a  tax rate on our gaap pretax income that would have resulted in roughly  million of income tax expense in  the additional  million of tax expense we recorded was primarily driven by the sale of ijie and yearend work including adjustments for our nol valuations for modeling purposes you should model a  to  effective tax rate going forward turning to our balance sheet we ended the year with  million in cash flat compared to the prior year during the year positive cash flow from operating activities was offset by cash used for acquisitions and investments of  million capital expenditures of  million to satisfy tax withholding obligations for employees related to vesting and stock repurchases under our authorized repurchase plans of  million finally ill give you some color on how were thinking about  i want to remind you that our longterm financial model is for double digit revenue growth target gross margins of  to  operating expense below revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margins of at least  we wont get there in  but we believe we will begin to see the signs of progress towards the end of the year we entered  in the midst of our investment mode as you model our potential results id like to give you some inputs to consider as you look at our  revenue i encourage you to model our core businesses in all of our businesses excluding merchandising and what you would expect for ijie in the highsingle digits id note when determining this growth rate we adjusted for the unusually strong national online growth in q for gross margin you should model close to our target gross margin model given the shutdown of our wedding supplies fulfillment operations and given the fact that our business will shift even more to the digital side in terms of operating expenses we are still in the midst of a transition and you should expect our operating expenses to be up modestly yearoveryear meaning savings from the exit of our ijie and wedding supplies operations will be reinvested into the business one thing to know on opex da should be down every year due to the end of the weddingchannel trade name amortization i mentioned before in terms of our effective tax rate with the disposition of ijie behind us and the revised estimates for nol you should model a  to  of fx tax rate going forward turning to capital allocation we continue to carefully evaluate three uses of our cash one investments in the business as per my guidance we are still in the middle of our transformation and we will be growing our total opex in  two stock buybacks during  we repurchased  million of shares and as of the end of february we have repurchased an additional  million of our shares finally strategic investments and ma at this time we have no news to share on that front thank you for your continued interest and support of our company this concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn the call over for questions thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of sameet sinha from b riley your line is open sameet sinha  b riley  co llc yes thank you very much first mike if you can talk about what sort of other product launches youre planning for rest of the year so that we can look out for those whether its mobile site online site or apps that will be helpful secondly as these products are launched can you also give us the kind of the cadence for investment as you reinvest those cost savings back in to the business should that be more firsthalf frontloaded kind of or evenly say throughout the year and third as the marketplace develops what are some of the metrics that we can keep track or that you should be able to provide that will give us a sense of the trajectory and the health of the business then i have a couple of followups thank you michael f steib  president chief executive officer  director hey sameet thank you first on launches in  we had to completely rebuild most of our core products our apps and our websites so the activities of our product tech work  this year were unusual and that they were full relaunches of the products what you should expect in  is the enhancement and improvement of those products to better engage our users and vendors to better match our users to the vendors that can fulfill their needs of the day of their wedding and to connect it to and facilitate transactions so dont expect in  big announces around launch days like weve had this year – like we had the last  months the websites and the apps instead expect to see us steadily improving the products and growing now to what is one of your next questions some of the key metrics around engaging our users matching our users to vendors and facilitating those connections and transactions between the two stay tuned for more specific metrics on some of our upcoming calls around engaging matching and connecting some of this that youve already heard from us today youve heard from us in recent calls around traffic around engagements between our users and vendors and then retention of our vendors and total revenue are still going to be some of the key ones that were going to pay very close attention to and you should be following gillian munson  chief financial officer sameet on the operating expenses we dont give quarterly guidance on opex but i dont see anything that would say that our quarterly sequential rates of opex are not unlike they have been in the past and so when you think about how our revenue growth will roll out you would likely see that rate of growth diverting again towards the second half of the year in terms of the opex themselves  youll see more of investment in the products and content area than in the other two lines in the operating expense line sameet sinha  b riley  co llc okay and specifically about national advertising so we saw the strength and you spoke about the execution my impression has been that national was – seems like its doing really well so thats great seems like youre going up from negative  now what in terms of your focus as you look across the portfolio of your products where does national figure in that and how should we think about it lets say over the next couple of years michael f steib  president chief executive officer  director the way that we think about our national business is its a strong contributor and one where we want to continue to foster steady performance the opportunity for national has been going to our advertisers with our vastly improved products which often can unlock more spend continuing to drive the core business and as you heard this year were seeing some really exciting traction in the bump so those should continue to give us steady performance and steady growth in our national advertising business sameet sinha  b riley  co llc okay fair enough thank you very much michael f steib  president chief executive officer  director pleasure operator our next question comes from the line of george askew from stifel your line is open george i askew  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes congratulations on a very nice quarter michael f steib  president chief executive officer  director thanks george nice to hear from you today george i askew  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you three questions on the local marketplace business from the perceptive of the vendor can you give us a sense of what they are seeing how they are seeing the increased engagement specifically are they seeing more leads are they seeing better conversion are they seeing better asps whats prompting them to be more involved and frankly to lower that churn thatd be the first question michael f steib  president chief executive officer  director george they are seeing significantly more traffic to their store fronts they are seeing significantly more leads and much of that in  has been driven by our success in mobile apps george i askew  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay good with regard to national advertising uniques were up  but can you kind of break down whats going on there you mentioned the bump is having great traction there are you winning more advertising customers there are you getting pricing because of some of the engagement is it driven by the traffic what are the drivers there as well michael f steib  president chief executive officer  director george in our local business kristin savilia whos running that business has been with xo for a while and so weve had the benefit of strong execution in the local business for years what you saw in  was that we complemented strong execution with product enhancements that further strengthened the value proposition for our local vendors in our national business jenny garrett is still relatively new to the organization shes been with us for about a year and in q i think you saw a lot of her work over the last year start to come to roost so i think the national story in  was very much an execution story and in  we should see the combination of that ongoing strong execution our new product launches and higher quality products coming together for national to continue to be a steady contributor to the organization george i askew  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay good and then lastly the merchandise business obviously youre in the final stages of the transition there but clearly thats a business that your users leveraged and used how are you going to replace that service to the brides and how do you get paid for it and where were going to see it in the income statement michael f steib  president chief executive officer  director so what youll see us doing now george is identifying those moments of commercial intent for our users and connecting them to our business partners who can fulfill on those moments of commercial intent and rather than us play the role of manufacturer were going to play the role of connector between our audience and people who do the manufacturing in the case of the knot shop while weve exited the manufacturing business we continue to maintain that section of our site and continue to market products like those to our users they are now fulfilled by a company called weddingstar with whom weve partnered and well continue to drive some revenue to our organization without us having to take on the costs of the fulfillment george i askew  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah perfect okay thank you those are my questions gillian munson  chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of sameet sinha of b riley your line is open sameet sinha  b riley  co llc yes thank you so a couple of followups actually on national advertising where did you see the strength was it in your kind of the core wedding or pregnancy categories or was it from kind of nonendemic advertisers and have you been able to do a study of maybe your cpms were much below the market and now you have an opportunity to increase those and if you could give us a sense of magnitude secondly also wanted gillian if you can kind of just quickly go through the guidance that you gave kind of a broad guidance that you gave for the next year and in that context could you specifically address kind of the trends in the publishing business thank you michael f steib  president chief executive officer  director sameet were seeing growth on both the knot and the bump the percentage growth on the bump is impressive off of what is immediately a smaller base cpms for this business are solid as im sure you are paying attention to the websites youre seeing big name advertisers both endemic and nonendemic on the knot and the bump and with strong execution out of jenny and her team this year i think what youre seeing in our results is that were unlocking deeper partnerships with bigger and more strategic accounts gillian munson  chief financial officer as to the guidance let me answer your second question first on the publishing business the strategy we have for publishing is to maintain healthy momentum in that business and that continues to be the strategy we will carry into  in terms of  guidance  continues to be a transitional year for our company as we continue to enter the year in an investment mode for the company so the specific guidance we gave was that core revenue excluding ecommerce will grow in the high single digits and we chose that number because of the particularly strong growth in national that we put that into that number secondly that we would expect our operating expense growth in total to be moderate which means that savings from ijie and ecomm will be reinvested into the business we commented that da will come down as we get past the amortization of the weddingchannel trade name and that we think all of this places us well to have a shot at getting at our target model in  and as a reminder that model remains the same which is for our company to generate revenue growth into the double digits target growth margins of  to  operating expense growth that grows below revenue growth and adjusted ebitda margin of at least  sameet sinha  b riley  co llc thank you gillian munson  chief financial officer youre
