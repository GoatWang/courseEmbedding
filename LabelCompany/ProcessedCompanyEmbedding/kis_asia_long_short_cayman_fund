we have worked on producing a single document that will keep investors and potential investors informed of our monthly performance the source of this performance and any market views we have for both the long standing kis asia long short fund the a denominated australian domiciled unit trust aut the new kis asia long short cayman fund the cayman domiciled multi currency feeder company the cayman fund the launch of the cayman fund has produced benefits for both fund holders where possible we have used our increased bargaining power to achieve better pricing for both funds for example we have managed to lower the commission costs with our most significant broker by  when writing a monthly report and giving any indication of predictive views it is imperative to avoid assuming that your current set of beliefs is the same as you held at the start of the month if you are writing a report based to the end of july in the third week of august it is very easy to appear to have been very accurate about the first three weeks of the month as a result these predictive comments to will be kept to a minimum this month we continue to have a bearish view of the world economic data is not positive showing a general slowdown across many countries and economic sectors for the early part of july we positioned the total portfolio with a short bias over the month we observed that at a micro level stocks rallied hard which had a large short interest and announced results that were better than a small miss we feel the equity markets are being squeezed higher due to shorts being covered or under allocations to equity weightings being taken to full allocation kis capital partners   long short the portfolio contributed bp of performance to the aut and bp of performance to the cayman fund positions taken in hong kong were the largest contributor to the portfolio this month producing  of the gains there was no single significant underlying within hk that produced the majority of the gain position taking in australia singapore and the use of us index futures as a hedge produced little return in australia our success ratio was limited with only  of trade ideas being winners with such a poor success ratio it is quite unusual to be able to talk of a positive contribution even if it is small at bp we were successful at the fast and effective stopping out of ineffective positions and the maximization of winning ideas on the long side we made profits on beach energy ltd contributing bp to the portfolio we see beach as a possible takeover target and plan to continue to retain a long exposure on the short side we suffered losses on energy world corp losing bp we had two significant winners on short positions in navitas limited and lynas corp ltd lynas contributed bp of profit as the price tumbles of the rare earth minerals it hopes to process in malaysia navitas contributed bp of profit to the portfolio with a strong a and less accommodating government policy we think it is difficult to compete with the education opportunities being offered in the us canada and europe this was borne out on the th july when navitas announced a slowing growth of international student enrolments portfolio hedge and equity arbitrage neither portfolio made a significant contribution to results this month special situations this portfolio contributed bp to the aut and bp to the cayman fund the difference in contribution was a result of receiving warrants on aleator energy subscribed for in april prior to the inception of the cayman fund these warrants were the sole property of the aut currency class fx hedge  kis only investments are received in us and spot exchanged to a this fx spot trade is then one month forward fx hedged back to us the cost of this fx hedge is a function
