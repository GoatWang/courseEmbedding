being recorded at this time i would like to turn the call over to mr jj pellegrino chief financial officer of lemaitre vascular please go ahead sir joseph p pellegrino jr thank you fab good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our q  conference call joining me on today’s call is our chairman and ceo george lemaitre and our president dave roberts before we begin i would like to read our safe

discussion and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures i’ll now turn the call over to george lemaitre george w lemaitre thanks jj q  featured some solid numbers  organic growth five more gross margin points and a  operating margin the quarter was better than we had expected so i leave the income statement details to jj i like to spend some time relating our q  results to the recently completed  initiatives and then i will make a few comments about our strategy and  direction in  we undertook the following initiatives refocused our european sales force on our proprietary vascular devices expand our geographic reach and third consolidate our manufacturing in burlington we are now benefiting from these initiatives our european operations were front and center in this transition looking back to   of europe sales were stent grafts and many reps were stent graft only clinical specialist fast forward to q  and we now have a  reps european sales force focused on vascular surgery we’ve also attacked on direct to hospital channels in spain and denmark while increasing the number of french and italian sales reps by  as a result of our refocusing in sales force expansion q  organic growth in europe was  perhaps the key headline of today’s call is the  basis point pick up in gross margin while the exit from lower margin distributed stent grafts has certainly helped so too have the italy and california factory closures as we’ve now fully consolidated into our burlington factory and we’re starting to see our new albograft production lines begin to manufacture more efficiently product quality and questions have been answered as well the uk and france rescinded their albograft pro editions in july following the successful uk audit in burlington so its safe to say that the italy and california transfers are now complete from increased european sales growth to a  point gross margin pick up to a pair of successful manufacturing transfers its nice to see the  initiatives producing tangible results on our income statement so what’s next our three strategic direction should come as no surprise number one we will continue to build out our vascular sales force in new countries number two we will develop new vascular devices and line expansion to the rd and finally number three we will look to acquire vascular devices to leverage our distribution platform over the last decade we’ve opened direct sales operations in the uk holland japan france italy and spain we just keep finding that our suite of niche vascular products sells best when paired with a direct sales force we project we will finish  with about  reps we will continue expanding geographically in  setting up a direct presence in brazil canada and switzerland these countries ranked number  number  and number  in terms of gdp in brazil and switzerland we will likely replace current distributors with lemaitre reps in canada which has quickly become our fourth largest entity we plan to open a toronto sales office and double our existing sales force to six reps an estimate of rep head count at the end of  might be  to  and this growing sales force acts like a new product catch basins the larger becomes the more product development opportunities it attracts and uncovers the q  books show rd grew  much of this increase was spend doubling our staff to  product engineers these folks speed to market new platforms next generation devices and product fixes the unballoon and the overthewire lemaitre valvulotome were both launched in q  and sold at an annualized rate of  in q  on the drawing board for late  launches are the silicone unballoon the  millimeter expandable lemaitre valvulotome and the second generation moll multitasc plaque debulker the silicone unballoon reduces sheathonsheath friction the  millimeter valvulotome is a further downsizing of our  millimeter flagship the moll multitasc will combine two of our current devices simplifying our remote endarterectomy procedure this increased pace of development will help us extend our dominance in niches like valvulotome and carotid shunting but it will also get us into new spaces like stent graft modeling with respect to acquisitions the lemaitre channel is a valuable asset which can substantially increase the sales of certain vascular devices this has been demonstrated exactly as we ramped up distribution of xenosure from  in  to  million in  and of course we own an exclusive option to acquire xenosure beginning in january  this is a nice model but we also like to acquire devices outright without such a long trial period we will stay tightly focused on vascular surgery whether we elect to use acquisition or internal development our tight call point is our business plan we are confirming guidance today which implies  organic growth for  and a  operating margin while just south of doubledigit this pair of nines is continued confirmation that we’re on the right track to grow sales and profits with that i will turn the call over to jj so he can fill in the details about this fine quarter joseph p pellegrino jr thanks george last quarter i noted that as we move away from the  initiatives we would set ourselves up for cleaner quarters and an improved pl this seem to play out in q with this in mind i would now like to review our q sales gross margin and operating expenses i will conclude with a few words about our share repurchase program dividends and guidance q  sales were  million an organic increase of  over q  sales increased  organically in the americas and international sales were up  led by spain japan germany and italy our strategic decision to refocus our european sales channel by exiting stent grafts and increasing rep head count by  both contributed to the gains in fact q  the european sales were strong across nearly all product lines the recently added xenosure biologic patch performed well while inahara’s carotid shunts were up  and valvulotomes  as george outlined above our gross margin also benefited from the  initiatives gross margin in q  was  versus  in the prioryear quarter a  basis point increase this improvement was due to our exit from stent grafts higher average selling prices and improved manufacturing efficiencies more specifically much of the training and start up cost associated with our  factory transfers acerbated regarding operating expenses q  total expenses excluding special charges were up  to  million the higher spend came from sales and marketing as well as rd sales and marketing increased  due to additional sales reps and direct marketing rd increased  due to higher head count these increases were partially offset by a  decline in general and administrative expenses to the italian factory closure and reduced compensation the comparatively weaker euro also reduced expenses on a yearoveryear basis q  operating income increased  to  million versus  in q  the increase was driven principally by an improved gross margin and a reduction in special charges the company’s operating margin in the quarter was  q  net income was  or  per diluted share versus  or  per diluted share in q  cash and marketable securities were  million at june   an increase of  during the quarter cash from operations was partially offset by share repurchases of  an increase in net inventories of  and two dividend payments of  this month our board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of  per share the dividend will be paid on september   to shareholders of record on august   also since august  we have repurchased  million of our authorized  million buyback program the program ends december   turning to guidance we expect q  sales of  million up  organically versus q  and reported operating income of  million we also continue to expect  fullyear sales of  million and reported operating income of  million these figures represent  organic sales growth and  operating margin given the  devaluation of the euro since our last call confirming  guidance of  million has effectively increased our fullyear organic growth rate from  to  with that i’ll turn it back over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and your first question will come from the line of joe munda with sidoti joseph munda  sidoti  company good afternoon guys joseph p pellegrino jr hi joe george w lemaitre hi joe joseph munda  sidoti  company real quick george with the reinstatement of albograft in europe are we going to see similar sales numbers that we’ve there before the stoppage george w lemaitre right that’s a good question so we’re free to sell now my senses in a market that’s competitive as dacron and again this is not a big piece of our business this is a  million business usually in total but my sense is if we have projected that this is a  million piece of business france and the uk maybe we lopped off annualized  or  something like that joe joseph munda  sidoti  company okay and i mean what were the result’s i’m just curious  what were the results of their findings george w lemaitre they came here they audited for three days i believe we had our whole staff here they went home they gave us a list of  questions and then they came back and said this is the uk and they said you’re back on the market and then the french followed that joseph munda  sidoti  company the french never came they just piggybacked off george w lemaitre that’s correct and it had been known all the time that the french piggyback to leave to put on prohibition and they also piggyback to get off prohibition joseph munda  sidoti  company and were other countries in europe waiting to see the findings that the uk had if there were any to possibly take action or was that just … george w lemaitre no  no they had all generally decided that everything was fine regardless of what the uk decided joseph munda  sidoti  company okay george w lemaitre but again the genesis of that problem joe is that i think unfortunately we got four of our issues of our  worldwide issues happen to be in the uk where only  of our sales were and so it looked anomalous to the uk agency joseph munda  sidoti  company okay and then on the number of reps you’re at  i think you said anywhere between  and  in  george w lemaitre that’s right joseph munda  sidoti  company is that without having an acquisition in place or is … george w lemaitre yeah that’s without acquiring a company that has a sales force so assuming we don’t acquire a sales force based company yes joseph munda  sidoti  company okay and then i guess this question is for dave as far as acquisitions are concerned this is my last question and i’ll hop back in the queue is there anything out there that really interests you at the moment and whats the ballpark is it still onetime sales or was that what you’re looking at or is it has the multiple increased david b roberts yeah thanks joe i cant really comment specifically about the pipeline although i would say generally speaking it looks good in terms of the number of opportunities and sort of the attributes of those opportunities with respect to valuation lemaitre still looks in generally the sweet spot is one to two times sales we just saw cryolife acquire hemisphere for  times sales and of course before that we saw baxter acquire synovis for three times sales so there is – valuations are still healthy in this space all day along we see companies getting acquired for three to four time’s sales but of course it just depends on whats exactly in the pipeline and how proprietary the pipeline is so we feel good about it right now generally speaking joseph munda  sidoti  company yeah i actually covered both those names and then jj one final question what was the capex through the firsthalf of the year joseph p pellegrino jr through the firsthalf of the year i am going to say about  somewhere in that range  joseph munda  sidoti  company okay all right thank you guys george w lemaitre thanks joe operator operator instructions your next question will come from the line of jason mills with canaccord genuity unidentified analyst hi this is christine indiscernible in for jason thanks for taking the call jj i have a question for you jason wanted me to ask you where you see gross margins trending over the next several quarter joseph p pellegrino jr yeah so you’ve seen our gross margin come up nicely over the last three or four quarters from the high ’s i think we were around  in q and q of last year and now sort of in that  range that has been reflective in part at least of our getting the manufacturing transition settled down which is happening i would say that we’ll continue to work on that process over the next couple of quarters so maybe we’re in that same  range over the next couple of quarters and then after that who knows and i would say we peaked at some  or something in q of  i don’t know about that any time soon but that will be a nice thing to shoot for at some point unidentified analyst great all right great and can you talk to me about some of the things that the most exciting things that you like in your pipeline george w lemaitre sure this is george i would say right now we’re really excited about the unballoon and the overthewire lemaitre valvulotome those launches have been ongoing for about six months and we’re getting great feedback about the concept of the unballoon and we’re also getting great feedback about overthewire valvulotome those are exiting ongoing launches and we also talked today about a couple of more launches which is we think we’ll be launching a  millimeter valvulotome we’re going to have a second generation version of our mollring multitasc and we also have an upgrade to our unballoon coming with the silicone inside the sheath for less friction movement on the sheath unidentified analyst great i mean i apologize i have not been following lemaitre closely and i am just back to followingup more closely can you remind me of the market potential for each of those products george w lemaitre sure i would say in general we’re quoting valvulotome the market size is being sort of  million the unballoon i think we’ve been quoting about  million market depending on whether you include thoracic or thoracic inner abdominal and on the mollring multitasc it’s caught up in this whole atherectomy and debulking space but isn’t exactly atherectomy so maybe that market potential was  million to  million all of them are very typical lemaitre niches or we try not to get into markets that are too too big for us so that our sales force can handle the competition unidentified analyst great thank you so much i’ll get back in queue george w lemaitre thanks christine operator your next question will come from the line of larry haimovitch with hmtc larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants good afternoon gentlemen george w lemaitre larry how you’re doing joseph p pellegrino jr hi larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants very well and yourself george w lemaitre very good very good larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants good couple of questions i apologize i joined a bit late did you give the number of shares you bought back during the buyback program during the prepared remarks joseph p pellegrino jr we did not we said that we have got  we bought about  million live todate we’ve got about  million remaining did you want to know another piece of that that’s basically the higher level larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants okay so the authorization was for a total of  million and it’s roughly  done joseph p pellegrino jr yeah exactly larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants okay second your reps are up to a high watermark of  i’m assuming that some of the newer reps haven’t kind of hit their full stride yet and as they do presumably this would give a nice boost to the sales as they build their territory joseph p pellegrino jr i mean it is all baked into guidance as far as what we see but yes you’re correct these are newer reps and they’re getting up to speed larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants okay and for any of you one of the companies that i follow in fact jason mills also follows it is vascular solutions on their q call they talked about the impact of the medical device facts which we all of course just absolutely love today have you quantified what that’s going to be for next year in a ballpark but obviously you’d have to give guidance to that but just in a ballpark way and secondly vascular solutions actually said we’re going to raise our prices to offset the medical device tax and i know you had that price increases in the past i wonder if you have any comments about that particular issue joseph p pellegrino jr yeah larry good question we started to prepare for that it’s not all that surprisingly it’s not all that straight forward how you calculate the med device tax but i am going to guess it’s going to be somewhere in the  to  range for us annually and that will probably hit up in the cost of goods sold line and that will be paid for probably in part through price increases and part through less hiring or lower expense and hopefully not on the bottom line larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants okay and is that your thinking now jj to put it actually in cost of goods as opposed to set the line item perhaps joseph p pellegrino jr yeah i think so we got to examine the actual rules a little bit closer which we’ll do over the next few months so we’ll have a better handle on that but i am thinking that’s where it goes larry haimovitch  haimovitch medical technology consultants okay that’s all i’ve got for now joseph p pellegrino jr thanks larry operator operator instructions and at this time there are no further questions in queue and i’d now like to turn the call back over to mr george lemaitre for closing remarks george w lemaitre thanks fab first i would like to thank all the participants on this
