the company was formed for the purpose of raising the necessary funds for purchasing servicing managing and reselling of nonperforming defaulted unsecured credit card debt portfolios to be acquired from financial institutions and distressed debt wholesalers since its inception the company derived no revenues and no income from such business and as result as of december   had an accumulated deficit of    we are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history our address is  rainbow blvd   las vegas nevada  the telephone number is  while our address is in nevada our sole officer and director currently operate our business from utah without an office and through the use of phone and email   the company has attempted to attract private placement investments in the past thus far the company has not been able to implement its plans or begin operations because it has not been successful in raising the equity capital necessary to implement such plans   there is no current public market for our securities as our stock is not publicly traded investors should be aware they probably will be unable to sell their shares and their investment in our securities is not liquid   at the present time we are classified as a “shell company” under rule  of the securities act rule b of the exchange act as such all restricted securities presently held by the affiliates of our company may not be resold in reliance on rule  until  we file form  information with the securities and exchange commission “sec” when we cease to be a “shell company”  we have filed all reports as required by section  and d of the securities act for twelve consecutive months and  one year has elapsed from the time we file the current form  type information with the sec reflecting our status as an entity that is not a shell company   bankruptcy or similar proceedings   there has been no bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding involving the company   reorganization purchase or sale of assets   other than the acquisition of the patent there have been no material reclassifications mergers consolidations or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets involving the company            effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business   the company will be subject to numerous national international regional state and local laws the company does not know when or whether additional legislation may pass or whether any such legislation would relate to the types of services currently planned to be provided by the company or which the company intends to develop accordingly the company cannot predict the effect if any that any such future regulation may have on its business   research and development activities during the last two years   we have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception   costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws   we don’t anticipate material costs or expenses related to compliance with environmental laws hydrogen is a clean energy sector and there may be some tax incentives associated with this sector   number of total employees and number of full time employees   we currently have one employee our executive officer russell heaton he devotes five  hours per week to our business and currently is responsible for our general strategy fund raising and customer relations once the offering is complete we will hire additional staff if we generate enough revenue to support the expense the number of additional staff will depend upon our growth   item a risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment   risks associated with our business   we are a development stage company and have no operating history an investment in the shares offered herein is highly risky and could result in a complete loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful in our business plan   credex was incorporated on september   and we have not yet commenced any business operations until we are actually in the marketplace for a demonstrable period of time it is impossible to determine if our business strategy will be viable or successful any such failure could result in the possible closure of our business or force us to seek additional capital through loans to continue business operations which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering   because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion because of the company’s losses limited working capital and the absence of any current revenuegenerating operations this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment            we cannot predict when or if we will produce revenues which could result in a total loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful in our business plans   we have not yet implemented our business plan or offered our services therefore we have not yet generated any revenues from operations in order for us to continue with our plans and open our business we must raise our initial capital to do so through this offering the timing of the completion needed to commence operations and generate revenues is contingent on the success of this offering there can be no assurance that we will generate revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to maintain our business as a result you could lose all of your investment if you decide to purchase shares in this offering and we are not successful in our proposed business plans   our business will be dependent on our ability to sell hydrogen units if we are unable to sell and secure more technology our business will be adversely affected   if we are unable to develop and sell we may not be able to execute our business plan we have no agreements of any kind at this time if we are unable to secure and retain new agreements our business financial condition andor results of operations could be materially and adversely affected we also cannot provide assurances that if we are able to establish such agreements that we will be able to maintain these agreements on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations   our success depends in significant part on global and regional demand and any factors that may have an adverse effect on such markets could have a material adverse effect on our proposed business financial condition and results of operations   our plan is to find a merger candidate or opportunity in the hydrogen sector accordingly our business financial condition and results of operations will be directly affected by the demand for our products demand is subject to fluctuation and adverse trends in the market could adversely affect our business in addition general economic conditions consumer trends energy prices work stoppages natural disasters and terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business a protracted global recession could have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted   the hydrogen industry is highly competitive which could adversely affect the company’s financial performance   the hydrogen industry is highly competitive we will face significant competition from established national regional and local providers there can be no assurance that if we are able to establish our business that will be able to compete successfully in the future with existing or potential competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on its business and financial condition   we may not be able to adapt our business quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards   the hydrogen industry is characterized by evolving industry standards frequent production enhancements and changing customer demands we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to changes in industry standards and customer requirements and preferences and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future any failure on our part to modify or adapt to these trends could render our business competitively disadvantaged which could adversely affect our business   any failure to comply with existing laws rules and regulations as well as changing laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties could adversely affect our business   we will be subject to a wide variety of statutes rules regulations policies and procedures in various jurisdictions which are subject to change at any time for example those laws rules and regulations relating to energy            our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we plan to operate and may require us to change certain aspects of our business plans to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for hydrogen reduce revenues increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities   we may need to obtain additional financing if we fail to generate revenue in the anticipated timeframe if we do not obtain such financing we may have to reduce or cease our activities and investors could lose their entire investment   our business plan will be funded by public offering but that there is no guarantee that any amount will be raised even if we are successful there is no assurance that we will operate profitably or generate positive cash flow in the future we may require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in receiving revenues at the levels we anticipate we currently do not have any arrangements for further and we may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us or on any terms at all because of the worldwide economic downturn or because of other reasons we may not be able to raise any additional funds that we require on favorable terms if any the failure to obtain necessary financing if needed may impair our ability to continue in business     you may suffer significant dilution if we raise additional capital   if we raise additional capital we expect it will be necessary for us to issue additional equity or convertible debt securities if we issue equity or convertible debt securities the price at which we offer such securities may not bear any relationship to our value the net tangible book value per share may decrease the percentage ownership of our current stockholders would be diluted and any equity securities we issue in such offering or upon conversion of convertible debt securities issued in such offering may have rights preferences or privileges with respect to liquidation dividends redemption voting and other matters that are senior to or more advantageous than our common stock   if we obtain debt financing we will face risks associated with financing our operations   if we obtain debt financing we will be subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and the risk that we will not be able to renew repay or refinance our debt when it matures or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of that debt if we enter into secured lending facilities and are unable to pay our obligations to our secured lenders they could proceed against any or all of the collateral securing our indebtedness to them or our other assets including the funds in the escrow account   our success is dependent on a limited number of key executives and other third party advisors   the success of our business strategy and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued employment of our senior management team and the services of other third party advisors the loss of the services of one or more of these key parties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition andor results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing senior management attract additional qualified executives or joint venture partners or adequately fill new senior management positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover we do not have employment agreements with our senior management team and we do not maintain keyperson life insurance policies on their lives the loss of any of our senior management or key personnel could seriously harm our business   we have no experience in the hydrogen industry   credex does not have substantial hydrogen industry experience or financial resources with such a lack of experience there can be no assurance that we will ever generate revenues or operate a successful business as a result you could lose all of your investment if you decide to purchase shares in this offering and we are not successful in our proposed business plans            mr heaton the sole officer and director of the company currently devotes approximately five  hours per week to company matters the company’s needs could exceed the amount of time or level he may have this could result in a conflict of interest and his inability to properly manage company affairs resulting in our remaining a startup company   we have not formulated a plan to resolve any possible conflict of interest with mr heaton’s other business activities in the event he is unable to fulfill any aspect of his duties to the company or we are required to search for a replacement for mr heaton we may experience a shortfall or complete lack of sales resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of our business   our management has no experience in a public company setting management decisions and choices may not take into account standard operating procedures required for a public company as a result we may have to suspend or cease activities which will result in the loss of your investment   mr heaton our sole officer and director has no experience as the principal executive officer or principal financial officer of a public company consequently our activities earnings and ultimate success could suffer irreparable harm due to management’s lack of experience as a result we may have to suspend or cease activities which will result in the loss of your investment   potential liability could cause credex to go out of business    the company’s intended operations and both the activities of the company could expose it to potential liability for which it may not be able to secure adequate levels of insurance if the company is found to be liable it may not be able to continue in business     we may fail to adhere to sec filing requirements    adherence to securities laws regulations and standards require substantial legal and financial expertise and compliance costs if our efforts to comply with securities laws regulations and standards investors may not receive key information on a timely basis and regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed   item b

has no dilutive instruments outstanding   income taxes   the company follows section  of the fasb accounting standards codification which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns   under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date   the company adopted section  of the codification section  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under section  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement section

shareholders equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity   disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage  the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim reporting periods beginning after december   however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements

inceptiontodate information on the respective financial statements   in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu”  on “presentation of financial statements going concern subtopic  – disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” currently there is no guidance in us gaap about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures the amendments in this update provide that guidance in doing so the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the amendments require management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically the amendments  provide a definition of the term substantial doubt  require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods  provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans  require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans  require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and  require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that

annual report on internal control over financial reporting   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the securities exchange act of   internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s chief executive officer and the chief financial officer and implemented by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap”   the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material impact on the financial statements   the company’s management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures or the company’s internal controls over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material errors an internal control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems the company’s internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances or because the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate   management of the company including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december   and determined that controls are ineffective due to the company’s small size and lack of segregation of duties            this annual report
