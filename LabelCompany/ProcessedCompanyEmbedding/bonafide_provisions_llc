“when i heard about bone broth i was really nervous to try it and was not going to spend  hours making it myself i saw this beef broth on the instagram i follow and picked it up at my local sprouts i heated it up and added some lime juice and salt and it was so tasty ive been drinking it nightly now for a couple weeks and have noticed i sleep better when i drink it before bed i have just been sipping it but plan to start cooking with it as too”  natalie the best tasting beef broth july   ★★★★★    “i tried a few other bone broths but fortunately my first foray into drinking bone broth was bonafide provisions that i found on sale at my local health food store because it was sooo delicious other brands mightve turned me off for ever or maybe you guys just spoiled me and i know how good it should taste it needs nothing added and is wonderful for breakfast or a bedtime snack well done”  kelly add your own review name email review title rating review content stay up to date and

revive glow renew if you read our site on even an irregular basis you’ll know that we frequently cover both drinkable soup and bone broth there are significant contrasts between these two concepts with drinkable soup largely a vegetable based vegan product and bone broth not much more than meatbased stock with this new product offering bonafide provisions seems to be trying to marry the two drinkable veggies bone broth which is usda organic certified contains chicken broth at the base of each savory flavor from there they’ve added vegetables salt spices and vinegar apple cider vinegar and white vinegar to create each individual formulation we’d describe the flavors as more savory and flavorful than either bone broth or drinkable soupfor this review we sampled five flavors glow tomato beet cucumber revive carrot fennel turmeric thrive squash onion turmeric renew red pepper and tomato and revitalize peas asparagus spinach lemon and mint hearing just the names you definitely won’t have a sense of what the actual flavors are one note about tasting these savory products we found them to be much more enjoyable as they approached room temperature the experience just isn’t the same when they are chilledour favorites of the bunch were thrive which has an incredible umami flavor revive which has a bright carrot flavor and revitalize which is loaded with fresh pea flavor but even the other two glow and renew are quite tasty although we feel as though they could use a bit more “pop”taking a look at the outside bonafide provisions has created something that looks and feels like a super premium product using cleanly executed illustrated graphics the product has visual appeal thanks to the clean arrangement on the label and its use of a single accent color for each product while it definitely has some visual appeal we feel as though the messaging that the product uses needs some work first and foremost the juxtaposition of placing “drinkable veggies” on top of “bone broth” in different fonts isn’t the most intuitive way to communicate what the product is when we first saw it we were immediately wondering if this was a “veggie bone broth” or simply a vegetable drink remedying this would be a huge help second the use of functional words such as “renew” or “thrive” seems meaningless in the context of bone broth or drinkable soup we feel as though this space could be better used for some sort of flavor name that helps the consumer understand what’s inside the bottle overall bonafide provisions has created some really nice innovation with this product line the nexus of drinkable soup and bone broth is something that works quite well and after seeing and tasting what they’ve created feels like it might have larger potential than either
