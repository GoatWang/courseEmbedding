wait in the office was very short she got right in she was treated with such kindness by the staff person that did her vitals and got her ready to see the doctor when the doctor came in to see her he was very kind he sat down across from her and discussed with her medical issues her plan of care and included me in the conversation at my sisters request he never once rushed her he was very knowledgeable she had a very low hemoglobin noted on a copy of her lab reports and i noted her hemoglobin was low and told her that i am not a doctor but i thought she need some blood she saw  other doctors prior to that and they had the same lab results and never addressed her hemoglobin dr aboulela did right away he sent her to the hospital outpatient center for blood it is very difficult to find physicians that take the time and treat their patients like this today there was only one person in the office that was not as personable and kind as the other staff she was the person handling accounts payable my sister had to meet with her because dr aboulela had told the lady to refund some money to my sister she had been putting her off and did so again that day in the process she was very rude and condescending my rating today however was for dr aboulela and the nurse my sister saw that morning and they were greatyahia rahim mdcori s ratedoutstanding doctorpros the smartest peds

doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence

issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day

days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery
