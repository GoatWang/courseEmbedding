 securities fraud attorneys and finra arbitration lawyers menu june   comments  current investigations kbs growth  income reit terminates offering last updated on june  investigating potential claims involving kbs growth  income reit are you concerned about your investment losses in kbs growth  income reit if so the white law group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a finra dispute resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment kbs growth  income reit a publicly registered nontraded real estate investment trust was formed in january  and has raised a combined  million in its private and public offerings the company often raises money for investments through reg d private placement offerings like the company did for kbs growth  income reit  these reg d private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission usually between  as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from  kbs growth  income reit inc closes offering kbs growth  income reit inc is closing its primary offering at the end of the month according to sec filings the reit plans to continue offering shares under its distribution reinvestment plan the board of directors approved the offering termination effective june   to prepare for and market an online private offering to accredited investors subscriptions for the primary public offering must be received in good order no later than june th in connection with the preparation of an online private offering the company said that it expects to establish and announce an estimated net asset value per share of its common stock following the nav announcement the reit’s advisor kbs capital advisors has agreed to pay stockholders any difference between the “net price paid” by stockholders and the estimated nav per share “net price paid” is the gross purchase price paid by stockholders less selling commissions and dealer manager fees the payment will be funded entirely by the advisor without any reimbursement from the reit and is ineligible for reinvestment through the distribution reinvestment plan the company noted that the tax treatment of the payment is not entirely clear and stockholders should consult with their tax advisor to determine the associated tax consequences kbs growth  income reit expects to declare an estimated nav and the stockholder payment to be made before the end of the third quarter of  the trouble with alternative investment products the trouble with alternative investment products like kbs growth  income reit is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds the white law group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling private placements like kbs growth  income reit and other kbs offerings broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment recommendation that is made is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age risk tolerance net worth financial needs and investment experience however another problem with reg d private placements is that the high sales commissions and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products  sometimes this provides brokers with an incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments they may even misrepresent the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks fortunately finra does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be found liable for investment losses in a finra arbitration claim recovery of investment losses to determine whether you may be able to recover investment
