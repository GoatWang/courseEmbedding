the drug until  photos pulmatrix inc logo may   pulmatrix logo prnewsfotopulmatrix inc download hi res close lexington mass may   prnewswire  pulmatrix inc nasdaq pulm a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary diseases today announced that it has received a key patent in the united states for its lead drug candidate pur which is intended to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases copd this patent ensures that the product is protected by intellectual property until  said robert w clarke phd chief executive officer for pulmatrix it also is further recognition of the potential medical advances offered by our innovative isperse™ technology for delivering drugs to the lungs more efficiently the new patent us  follows both an earlier patent granted in japan in  jp  for the composition of pur and several broader patents such as us     and  that provide protection for pulmatrixs technology platform and its use to treat a wide variety of diseases the new patent covers pur an inhaled drug made by combining pulmatrixs technology platform with tiotropium bromide tiotropium bromide is the active ingredient in spiriva a blockbuster inhaled drug with annual global sales of approximately € billion in  the limitation with current inhaled products is that a significant amount of the drugs get stuck in the mouth or throat causing side effects and poor delivery efficiency to the intended site of action in the lungs pulmatrix has tackled this problem by creating a dry powder that flies more easily into the lungs drugs like tiotropium bromide that are incorporated into the isperse powder thus are far more likely to reach their intended target offering a major medical benefit in fact clinical trials of pur have shown that the product is up to five times more efficient at delivering the drug to the lungs than are the currently marketed alternatives pulmatrix is now developing pur in both europe and the united states following regulatory pathways that offer quicker approvals and lower costs this new patent is another step forward to bringing pur to market—and to be able to offer new benefits to patients suffering from copd added dr clarke about pulmatrix        pulmatrix is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address
