published december   to scott w schoelzel of janus capital the choppy stock market in middecember was a great gift a chance to scoop up his favorite growth stocks at bargain prices thats because the stocks he owned had become expensive by the end of november and so he sold some shares to lighten his load as a result his cash position swelled to  percent of assets from his usual target of  percent as a general rule i like to keep a fair amount of cash available because there is so much volatility in these markets he explained in a recent interview so when the dow industrials dropped  points in a couple of days it was not a painful event but a welcome one mr schoelzel pronounced sholzel picked up shares in johnson  johnson hospitality franchise systems us robotics and shiva a technology company at prices he found much more reasonable that strategy  adding to longterm positions during market dips  is one of the hallmarks of mr schoelzels investing style which emphasizes companies with rapid growth in earnings it has served him well at the three idex funds that he manages for janus from denver the funds which he took over from tom marsico nearly two years ago have gained  percent a year on average during his tenure compared with  percent for all growth funds mr schoelzel also runs more than  million in pension and private accounts of his funds idex ii growth is the largest at  million the original fund idex and idex  which is now closed carry huge sales charges of  percent each the sales charge for idex ii growth is a substantial  percent investors who prefer the noload route will soon have their own opportunities mr schoelzel has added a fund called olympus that is set to begin trading on tuesday without a sales charge olympus will let him choose among small midsize and large companies both here and abroad it will also be more aggressive than the idex funds which avoid small stocks no matter what the group of stocks mr schoelzel is a traditional growth manager when someone asks me what i look for in a company the answer is almost always earnings earnings earnings  he said even fastgrowing companies with high priceearnings ratios dont scare him away as long as the growth appears sustainable in particular he looks at whether earnings growth stems from rising revenues or corporate costcutting im biased toward growing the top line which really indicates the health of the business he said though he buys stocks that are rapidly gaining in price mr schoelzel does not consider himself a momentum investor because he tends to own positions for a long time as an example he points to the three years he ran founders growth which outperformed its peers in that time before he joined janus if you look at my founders portfolio and what i own now youd think id been on vacation for five years he said at the idex funds the turnover rate  or percentage of stocks that are replaced each year  averages  percent but most of that can be attributed to trimming core positions when the price seems right im a big believer that you get big returns not in three or four weeks but in three or four years he said as such he buys new stocks slowly perhaps in a chunk equal to half of  percent of the fund then as the story unfolds ill continue to add to it completing the initial purchase over six months he said after that it is a question of watching the market selling shares when prices get too high and adding more when prices dip he generally plies his trade in sectors he knows well pharmaceuticals health care telecommunications technology and financial services excited about java one of his favorite stocks is sun microsystems which he called a pure play on the proliferation of the internet and distributed computing architectures the most excitement is about suns computer language called java which has been licensed by microsoft ibm and others and can be used to write applications that run across the internet or on any type of computer in hardware an upgrade of suns sunspark work station called ultraspark is a powerful new product as well what about those ever important revenues mr schoelzel expects  percent growth at sun next year the companys stock at its recent price of  may seem expensive to some but using mr schoelzels earnings estimate of  a share next year the stock is trading at less than  times earnings while shares of sun are selling at a multiple just over the market the company can expect earnings growth of  to  percent a year he said most important the mix of their business is starting to richen as they move from hardware to a larger and larger software component which has much bigger margins mr schoelzel said focus on health care among the high fliers in his portfolios are companies that design and sell computerized information systems for the health care industry which mr schoelzel says is woefully behind on the technology curve hbo  company of atlanta not only creates systems but also sets up and manages data processing offices for hospitals the companys stock which opened the year just over  a share sells for about  given the tremendous amount of business that the company is bidding on now mr schoelzel said he expects earnings to reach  a share next year using that earnings estimate the company is selling at more than  times earnings buying hospitality franchise mr schoelzel has been buying more shares recently in hospitality franchise systems which provides advertising reservations systems and other types of support to franchisees of six motel chains including howard johnson and days inn through a series of preferred providers the company markets a variety of products like a rental car to someone who calls to make a hotel reservation mr schoelzel said the company also provides support services to  century  real estate franchises and it recently announced an agreement to develop days inn properties in china and hong kong again some aggressive growth projections come rushing out mr schoelzel expects the company to earn  a share for   next year and  in  the stock now trading at  can trade at  times our  figure which would be  to  a share he said hospitality franchise does not show up in the idex funds because the companys market capitalization was less than  billion when he started buying it mr schoelzel said but the company now valued at  billion shows up in his private accounts and small stocks of all sorts will be fodder for the new olympus fund at the end of the year his portfolio remains a bit heavy in cash im not uncomfortable going into the new year light he said because a cut in capital gains taxes could lead to a selloff and push down prices creating more of his favorite buying opportunities longer term though he is positive on the market in part because of the decline in bond yields which he expects to make stocks more attractive photo scott w schoelzel  invests in companies with rapid earningsgrowth now hes buying sun
