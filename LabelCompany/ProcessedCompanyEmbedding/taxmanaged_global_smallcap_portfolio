standards codification topic  a  investment valuation  the following methodologies are used to determine the market value or fair value of investments equity securities equity securities listed on a us securities exchange generally are valued at the last sale or closing price on the day of valuation or if no sales took place on such date at the mean between the closing bid and asked prices therefore on the exchange where such securities are principally traded equity securities listed on the nasdaq global or global select market generally are valued at the nasdaq official closing price unlisted or listed securities for which closing sales prices or closing quotations are not available are valued at the mean between the latest available bid and asked prices foreign securities and currencies foreign securities and currencies are valued in us dollars based on foreign currency exchange rate quotations supplied by a third party pricing service the pricing service uses a proprietary model to determine the exchange rate inputs to the model include reported trades and implied bidask spreads the daily valuation of exchangetraded foreign securities generally is determined as of the close of trading on the principal exchange on which such securities trade events occurring after the close of trading on foreign exchanges may result in adjustments to the valuation of foreign securities to more accurately reflect their fair value as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange when valuing foreign equity securities that meet certain criteria the portfolios trustees have approved the use of a fair value service that values such securities to reflect market trading that occurs after the close of the applicable foreign markets of comparable securities or other instruments that have a strong correlation to the fairvalued securities affiliated fund the portfolio may invest in eaton vance cash reserves fund llc cash reserves fund an affiliated investment company managed by eaton vance management evm while cash reserves fund is not a registered money market mutual fund it conducts all of its investment activities in accordance

investment securities based on available market quotations provided by a third party pricing service prior to cash reserves funds issuance of units in october  the value of the portfolios investment in cash reserves fund reflected the portfolios proportionate interest in its net assets and the portfolio recorded its pro rata share of cash reserves funds income expenses and realized gain or loss fair valuation investments for which valuations or market quotations are not readily available or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or at the direction of the trustees of the portfolio in a manner that fairly reflects the securitys value or the amount that the portfolio might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon its current sale in the ordinary course each such determination is based on a consideration of relevant factors which are likely to vary from one pricing context to another these factors may include but are not limited to the type of security the existence of any contractual restrictions on the securitys disposition the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer or of comparable companies or entities quotations or relevant information obtained from brokerdealers or other market participants information obtained from the issuer analysts andor the appropriate stock exchange for

to have personal liability for the obligations of the portfolio however the portfolios declaration of trust contains an express disclaimer of liability on the part of portfolio interestholders and the bylaws provide that the portfolio shall assume the defense on behalf of any portfolio interestholder moreover the bylaws also provide for indemnification out of portfolio property of any interestholder held personally liable solely by reason of being or having been an interestholder for all loss or expense arising from such liability additionally in the normal course of business the

with foreign investments investing in securities issued by companies whose principal business activities are outside the united states may involve significant risks not present in domestic investments for example there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies particularly those not subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements of the us securities laws certain foreign issuers are generally not bound by uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements and standards of practice comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers investments in foreign securities also involve the risk of possible adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations expropriation or confiscatory taxation limitation on the removal of funds or other assets of the portfolio political or financial instability or diplomatic and other developments which could affect such investments foreign securities markets while growing in volume and sophistication are generally not as developed as those in the united states and securities of some foreign issuers particularly those located in developing countries may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable us companies in general there is less overall governmental supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets brokerdealers and issuers than in the united states   fair value measurements under generally accepted accounting principles for fair value measurements a threetier hierarchy to prioritize the assumptions referred to as inputs is used in valuation techniques to measure fair value the threetier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below      level   quoted prices in active markets for identical investments      level   other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar investments interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc      level   significant unobservable inputs including a funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments in cases where the inputs used to measure fair value fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy the level disclosed is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities at october   the hierarchy of inputs used in valuing the portfolios investments which are carried at value were as

awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

offered loadwaived through fidelitys ntf program risk low avg high average this fund scores average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to
