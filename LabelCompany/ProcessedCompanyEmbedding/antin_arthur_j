robert antin and his brother chief operating officer arthur j antin the antin brothers and neil tauber who is now senior vice president started vca around the time westernu founding president philip pumerantz phd was exploring the possibility of opening of a veterinary college vca supported dr pumerantz as he opened the college of veterinary medicine and contributed to the one health concept which is the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally nationally and globally to attain optimal health for people animals and the environment “the role of veterinarians in public health as well as medicine has gained in significance going beyond the diseases that affect both animals and man” said westernu senior vice president thomas g fox phd “the concept of one health and its public health significance contributes to and mandates a healthy environment healthy animals and healthy people robert has always had vca in the forefront of efforts to improve the understanding of the importance of one health” westernu college of veterinary medicine cvm alumna jaimie siegel dvm ’ grew up with antin as a neighbor she babysat his children and when he found out she wanted to become a veterinarian he helped her get a job at age  as a kennel assistant at a vca hospital that early experience helped her gain a realistic view of her future profession siegel continued to work for vca while attending westernu and completed an emergency critical care and surgery internship at vca after earning her doctor of veterinary medicine degree she worked at vca for nine years before starting her own concierge practice in hermosa beach “vca is very accepting of who you are as a person they think about the individual more than a lot of other companies” siegel said “i’m a supporter of the company—the work they do their mission statement vca is about individualism it’s about the individual client and the individual animal” every cvm student takes the diagnostic laboratory and pathology course at vca’s antech diagnostics laboratory in orange county calif and many vca practices provide training opportunities to cvm students vca is one of the many clinical partners in the community that supports westernu by providing students the opportunity to work extensively with animals alongside veterinarians in the local area after completing the fouryear doctor of veterinary
