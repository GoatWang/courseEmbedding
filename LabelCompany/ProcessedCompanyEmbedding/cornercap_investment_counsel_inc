want to evaluate them objectively asking each advisor a consistent set of questions will help ensure that you have the information you need to make a good comparison what are your credentials an

financial planning coursework and passed a hour exam covering nearly  topics from group medical insurance to derivatives more information  cfa® chartered financial analyst® cfas must pass three exams

investment management analyst® cimas focus on asset allocation and typically complete final coursework at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley or at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school of business more information  suggestion  visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification common credentials  this is not a complete list of certifications there is no implied endorsement of one certification over another professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values do you offer the services i need investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide in general they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below money managers if you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing consider money managers they design investment portfolios generally consisting of stocks bonds and other individual securities often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you may not offer general financial planning services financial planners if you need someone to review your situation and help with bigpicture planning consider financial planners they help you look to the future and do longterm financial planning in the areas of retirement college funding wealth transfer tax planning and insurance may not offer investing and portfolio management services wealth managers if you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs consider wealth managers they provide highly personalized comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for highnetworth clients coordinate with other professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants to serve more complex financial needs which may include tax minimization trust management wealth transfers real estate management and portfolio performance analytics how are you compensated knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive independent advisors generally work on a feeonly or feepluscommissions basis types of compensation and what they mean to you fee only assetbased hourly or flat fees many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you typically – this compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific onetime service eg developing a financial plan the fee may vary by account size and service in addition to these fees you may pay commissions andor other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets fee plus commissions along with an advisory or financial planning fee some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends such as insurance policies or annuities commissions only advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you wrap fees sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee which is typically a single assetbased fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make how will we work together good communication between you and your advisor is essential asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect what to ask with whom will i work in some cases the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it if personal rapport is important to you ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with how often will we communicate regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals risk tolerance and investment strategy typically your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email how will you report performance at a minimum you should expect to receive account statements from the advisor or custodianbrokerage firm where your assets are held quarterly summaries of yeartodate investment performance a comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor what is the size of your firm a firm’s size – including the number of employees the assets under management and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services small firms may offer more personalized attention the average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm how do you approach investing for people like me things to consider performance ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks such as the sp ® index during the same time period an advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark investment style advisors may specialize in certain types of investments such as mutual funds stocks or bonds and styles such as growth or value you can assess whether the advisors methodology or style aligns with your objectives asking about an advisors investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand decisionmaking advisors who have a disciplined approach to decisionmaking may be more likely to stay focused on your longterm goals many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time your strategy should be based on your goals time horizon and comfort with risk knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic longterm approach or invests in shortterm trends past performance does not guarantee future results the sp ® index is an index of widely traded stocks indexes are unmanaged do not incur fees or expenses and cannot be invested in directly where will my assets be held independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks mutual funds and other assets why should you ask this question you want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets look for a custodian with important services such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity preliminary screening you can review pertinent information about an advisor

cornercap’s investment approach is designed to objectively implement our investment philosophy of minimizing the impact of emotion in investment decisions and reducing the imbedded costs so destructive to longterm investment performance our investment approach is embodied in two distinct ways building and managing multiasset class portfolios based on expertly balancing a client’s risk profile and time horizon buying and selling individual stocks based on fundametrics® research process our proprietary research system in each of these independent thinking bottomup fundamental analysis and a contrarian value discipline is at the core of our approach our investment committee ensures consistent and objective application of our investment approach for each client  multiasset class portfolios building a portfolio of diversified investment asset classes is the key to achieving longterm goals but we believe many advisors do not properly understand the pros and cons of multiasset class diversification blindly following the endowment model popularized by larger universities or foundations can lead to increased cost diminished returns and unintended consequences see our feature article the irresistable melody of the pied piper for our full analysis of the endowment model to summarize our view we believe that asset allocation strategies for most investorsto properly weather economic uncertainties over an investment cyclemust  reflect the principles of transparency liquidity and reasonable cost and  recognize that asset classes can behave very differently depending on the underlying economic regime this is why our approach to asset allocation incorporates an analysis of how different asset classes perform in various economic environments we take time to understand each client’s risk profile and near term and long term intentions to create a customized allocation strategy that is diversified across various economic cycles with consideration to the client’s tolerance for risk volatility and liquidity our goal is to maximize the expected return for the level of acceptable risk we construct our portfolios with investments that are simple and transparent easy to rebalance and avoid imbedded fees volatility cannot be completely diversified but it can be matched to an investor’s proper risk profile and goals fundametrics® research process our investment approach for equity investments begins with an objective quantitative evaluation of a wide range of stocks fundametrics® research process our proprietary computerbased research tool allows us to  screen and rank stocks according to specific valuation criteria or fundamental data fundametrics® recognizes the most attractive investment ideas and offers an objective “buy” and “sell” signal  next we conduct a qualitative assessment of this group of stocks which includes reviewing the inputs in fundametrics® for accuracy and reasonableness assessing the quality of earnings and cash flow of potential stock ideas stress testing the balance sheet for risk ensuring appropriate diversification along the industry supply chain fundametrics® uses over  investment factors to determine the relative attractiveness of the stocks we are evaluating we rely most heavily on a core group of factors that have proven to be the most discriminating and noncorrelated and when taken in the
