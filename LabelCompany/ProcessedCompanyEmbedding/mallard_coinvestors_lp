foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why enterprise products partners lp is a dividend investors dream this energy infrastructure giant has a long history of paying investors a growing stream of income and it doesnt appear to be ending anytime soon matthew dilallo tmfmd jun   at pm enterprise products partners nyseepd has been everything an income investor could have dreamed of over its nearly  years as a public company not only has the company paid investors every single quarter since its ipo in  but it has increased the payout  times including for the past  straight quarters enterprise has achieved that growth through a balance of acquisitions and growth projects which has steadily increased its stream of stable cash flow that said the companys best days appear to be ahead of it thats because it not only boasts a wellsupported current distribution of  but it has visible growth coming over the horizon thanks to a slew of capital projects under construction that combination of solid financials and clear growth potential makes enterprise an ideal investment for income investors image source getty images a strong foundation thats only getting better one of the reasons why enterprise products partners has delivered such steady growth throughout its history is due to the companys conservative financial management the foundation of its financials is an investmentgrade balance sheet and a wellcovered distribution the company currently has one of the highest credit ratings among mlps at bbbbaa backed by a conservative debttoadjusted ebitda ratio that has averaged a comfortable  times over the past year furthermore leverage is on its way down to  times once its current slate of expansion projects enter service this year meanwhile enterprise routinely retains a substantial portion of its cash flow to reinvest in growth projects including maintaining a  times distribution coverage ratio last year  for comparison sake rival energy transfer partners nyseetp leverage ratio has been well above  times over the past year and it had a sub times coverage ratio for much of the recent past those weaker metrics were the driving force behind its decision to combine with an affiliate that had stronger financial metrics that deal also amounted to a backdoor distribution cut for energy transfer partners investors which it deemed as a necessary step to get its distribution coverage back above  times and its leverage down to a more comfortable  times over the next year in addition to the sound financial profile another pillar of strength for enterprise products partners is the stable cash flow it collects from its predominately feebased asset base thanks to its focus on building and buying feebased assets over the past few years the company has reduced its direct exposure to commodity prices from  of its gross operating margin in  to just  this year because of this improving stability enterprise delivered stable cash flow during the recent oil market downturn contrast this with energy transfer partners which saw its cash flow decline during the markets turmoil causing its balance sheet to weaken and prompting the payout cut image source getty images an  billion building boom with more on the way with a strong balance sheet and stable cash flow enterprise products partners can maintain its current payout rate for the foreseeable future that said what makes it such a compelling stock for income investors is the growth thats clearly up ahead coming from the  billion of capital projects it currently has under construction the company expects to commission about  billion of those projects this year with all but  million scheduled to enter service this summer the largest project is enterprises pdh facility which will turn propane into a feedstock for making plastics once up and running the plant will generate steady cash flow for the company because it has secured feebased contracts for  of the capacity and they run for an average of  years enterprise has two more waves of project completions coming down the pipeline with  billion of assets expected to enter service next year and another  billion in  among those projects is the recently sanctioned shin oak ngl pipeline which will move liquids from the fastgrowing permian basin to the companys ngl fractionation and storage hub in mont belvieu texas meanwhile the company is already working to capture additional opportunities so it can continue growing one of the projects enterprise has in development is a potential natural gas pipeline from the permian to the gulf coast that said competitors have already proposed similar pipelines so this project isnt a sure thing because of that it might need to get creative and instead of trying to beat out competitors it could choose to join forces with one of them aside from this project enterprise has acquired land adjacent to several of its hubs in recent years giving it plenty of room to expand those facilities once it lines up customers that need access to additional capacity investor takeaway enterprise products partners has been a consistent dividend grower throughout its history thanks to its prudent financial management and focus on building and buying assets that provide it with predictable cash flow with its next three years of cash flow growth already locked up thanks to projects under construction the company shouldnt have any problem keeping its distribution growth streak alive its a powerful combination that should continue to make enterprise product partners an income investors dream come true matt dilallo owns shares of enterprise products partners the motley fool recommends
