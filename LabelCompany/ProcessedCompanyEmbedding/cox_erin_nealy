digital threatsformer federal prosecutor and chief of staff in the justice department’s office of legal policyon the board of trustees of the dallas children’s advocacy centerinvolved with the children’s trust and several charities devoted to fighting multiple sclerosis dbj what was your first job as a teen or in college etc nealy cox lifeguard — those were the days dbj why did you decide to go into your line of work nealy cox although an entrepreneurial path going into digital forensics in the private sector seemed like a natural progression for my career i already had several years of experience investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes for the justice department i was attracted to stroz friedberg because it is run by former federal prosecutors and investigators like me and enjoys a reputation for objective neutrality and integrity within the industry when i decided to leave public service i wanted a new challenge and i was excited to have the opportunity to open and lead stroz friedberg’s dallas office and computer forensics lab even though i’m more of a businesswoman now i still use my lawyering skills every day as well as my knowledge of computers and data security to help businesses solve some of their biggest problems dbj what do you enjoy most about your jobcareer nealy cox people come to us with problems they’ve experienced a problem with their digital assets and they’re at the point where they need help many times fast at the end of the day i enjoy helping clients answering the who what when where why and how using the best evidence they have which is usually digital evidence i enjoy the challenge developing business and also providing objective guidance to companies and assisting them with strategic decisions dbj what do you like the least about your jobcareer nealy cox cyber criminals don’t keep regular office hours data breaches can disable a company at any time we respond whenever and wherever we’re needed and we work until the problem is resolved the reactive nature of my job can wreak havoc on the personalprofessional life at the same time it’s very gratifying when you are able to get it right my life is filled with many wonderful challenges so i always try and view it as a blessing not a burden dbj what do you think has been the key to your success nealy cox a combination of things — trusting my instincts about right and wrong being a quick study and working hard i have never considered myself one of those people who things come easily for — i’m more of a hard work and determination sort of gal dbj what’s the greatest challenge you’ve had to face and how did you overcome it nealy cox i joined the us attorney’s office as a young female attorney from a civil law firm most of my colleagues were older male and had a great deal of trial experience across the board i had to earn their respect and prove that i was worthy to be among them that’s a tough challenge given the caliber of the attorneys at the us attorney’s office but it was a challenge that made me a much better lawyer dbj of what professional achievement are you most proud and why nealy cox i am proud to have taken the nontraditional path in my career — always looking for new challenges and leadership opportunities dbj what is your business motto nealy cox the best way to predict the future is to create it dbj what are you known for by your peers nealy cox honesty integrity high standards some would say too high silliness and my love of all things shoes and bags dbj tell us about a north texas business leader you admire and why nealy cox getting back to my love of shoes i admire the way stanley marcus built a brand — personally as well as for his stores and by extension the city of dallas — that was synonymous with style class and quality he is an example of how a business leader can have an enormous effect on a city through civic involvement and active corporate leadership dbj what is your greatest achievement outside of work nealy cox my greatest achievement perhaps better to say aspiration and challenge is working on a daily basis with my husband trey cox who is a successful and busy dallas lawyer to create a happy and nurturing environment for our two girls — one where they see the world as limitless in terms of possibility and grow up knowing they can do and be anything in their life our motto for them is anything is within their grasp with hard work and determination dbj how would you rate dallasfort worth as a market for young executivesentrepreneurs nealy cox dallasfort worth is diverse and cosmopolitan — more so than other cities in the southwest north texas is an area where doors open for people with good ideas who are willing to work hard dbj what is your ultimate career goal nealy cox to seek out challenging leadership opportunities my goal is to have a satisfying fulfilling career one that i can balance successfully with my personal and family priorities dbj what piece of advice did you receive early on that still rings true nealy cox “always try your best to do good” that’s what judge henry politz used to always tell me he was chief judge of the fifth us circuit court of appeals when i worked for him as a law clerk fresh out of law school after our year working together i often called him for advice and mentoring he would start every conversation with “what good have you done today” i try to take that with me wherever i go dbj what is your most significant community service leadership role in which you serve nealy cox i tend to focus on charities that either help children or assist lowincome women raising children on their own i’m involved with children’s hospital the dallas county child advocacy center the ywca and hope cottage dbj and just for fun if you were a superhero which one would you be and why nealy cox wonder woman for obvious reasons
