your credit report for up to 0 years after the filing date has been accepted and recorded at the irs a paid tax lien however will be removed after seven years from the date of filing  as long as it has been paid in full and the irs and government is happy with the contribution  this information is collected and updated quite regularly by the government who wishes to receive their money in the most timely manner possible from the individual or a business who owes back taxes the information tends to stem from local courts where either a representative or credit reporting company provides the information to the court and to any national companies  of course as with any public records or court filed documents mistakes can and often will happen to the individual should this be the case you are fully within your rights to dispute such instances just like one would with any type of credit account information such disputes generally run through online resources and websites or by phone and mail though those two options may take a tad bit longer to complete without accessing public tax lien records though one would never know of any form of mistake that had been made on their own account this is why it absolutely pays to check in one such information on the regular if you or someone you know has a tax lien attached to their account or person it would be best to continue keeping an eye on the situation using public record information a tax lien ensures the government has their own stake and interest in a property owned by an individual this is not beneficial to the property owner and it can hurt their credit and their person after awhile as a lawabiding tax payer you should always keep track of your records the freedom of information act has made such instances possible and far easier than before easy and affordable tax lien records access unlimited tax lien records searches and reports your membership includes as many tax lien records searches and tax lien records
