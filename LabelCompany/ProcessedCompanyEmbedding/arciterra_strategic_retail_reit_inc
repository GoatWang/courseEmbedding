estate investment trust based in phoenix arizona reit investments like the arciterra national reit typically offer commissions between  percent which is significantly higher than traditional investments like mutual funds and stocks in some cases the commission generated by these investments can be as high as  percent this higher commission can explain why brokerage firms are motivated to recommend these investments despite their possible unsuitability stock fraud lawyers are investigating the possibility that brokerage firms may be held liable for the recommendation of arciterra national reit financial industry regulatory authority rules have established that brokers and firms have an obligation to fully disclose all the risks of a given investment when making recommendations and those recommendations must be suitable for the individual investor receiving the recommendation given their age investment objectives and risk tolerance nontraded reits are illiquid and inherently risky and therefore not suitable for many investors furthermore the arciterra national reit reportedly offered private placements in order to raise capital these private placements were then offered by brokerdealers registered with the financial industry regulatory authority according to investment fraud lawyers because private placements are typically more complicated and carry more risk than other traditional investments they are usually only suitable for sophisticated highnetworth investors if you suffered losses in the arciterra national reit another risky reit or were unsuitably
