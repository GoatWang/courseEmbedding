growth momentumsummarysimulations plus is a leader in a rapid growth industrythis is a strong company thats going on its th consecutive profit quarterthe company operates in a drug simulation industry that is expected to grow more than  a year from now till simulations plus not only offers  growth upside in a year or two but also delivers a healthy dividend yieldhalf the battle when finding the right stock to invest in is finding the right industry  and with markets at alltime highs this is even more important you could have the best operating stock in a failing industry like newspapers bookstores or big box retail stores but the industry that simulation plus operates in is anything but a failing industry instead it is at its beginning of a massive growth phase as technology and regulations come together simulations plus nasdaq slp is an industry leader when it comes to the software that pharmaceutical companies use to conduct research for new discoveries and developments in short it allows big drug companies as well as the food and drug administration fda and other governmental agencies to test the effects drugs can have on the human body this is largely an institutional process which helps translate into strong growth and a dependable market but going forward it presents significant growth opportunities see many companies still have to spend millions conducting clinical trials to see how the drugs perform when put into a real environment but as technology continues to progress so too does the electronically simulated trial data simulated trials are not yet considered a replacement for clinical data this technology helps companies assure better results and speed up the process which saves them millions of dollars every time they want to test a new drug simulations plus has agreements with the top  pharmaceutical companies as well as the fda thats a decent client list especially considering many of the top pharmaceutical companies already have some sort of inhouse simulating processes but still have to partner with simulations plus for its simulations this just shows you how simulations plus has premium processes that even the largest pharmaceutical companies need and more importantly are currently unable to duplicate in house product breakdown simulations plus rock star portfolio consists of six different simulations with the most recent addition the other week  membraneplus membraneplus is the companys first new software product in about ten years this product helps pharmaceutical companies use a simulation to measure the rate of dissolution of certain drugs when they enter the blood stream this is critical in determining how and when the drug will impact the body ultimately these results will help scientist predict the impacts a new drug may have in humans this product has been in the works for years and was delayed often it was supposed to be released in march of this year but was finally released last week its other products include admet predictor short for absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity predictor medchem designer medchem studio dddplus and gastroplus each serves a specific function in the simulation industry but the companys flagship product is gastroplus this product is a software package that simulates drug interactions in humans it has been identified as the top ranked program for determining the outcome of drugs introduced into a persons blood stream its in widespread use at pharmaceutical companies the fda and the us national institutes of health among others it was recently awarded a  grant a year over the next three years as long as there is progress to improve modeling and simulation for medicine applied to eyes with the us food and drug administration a great example of the types of uses this simulated product comes in handy for is on infants specifically those that are born premature and are the most vulnerable to possible side effects a drug may have premature babies are also very sensitive to doses and gastroplus allows pharmaceutical companies to practically test out the effects of a drug without having to put someones baby at immediate risk admet predictor is ranked number one in its respected segment the premise for this product is to allow scientist to receive a large number of estimates ranging from admet absorption distribution metabolism excretion and toxicity without the need to physically test them medchem designer and medchem studio are addons and upgrades to the admet predictor to further enhance its service for the user the dddplus product simulates dissolution testing for drug formulas while looking at the rate based on if its a powder capsule or tablet form this helps scientist determine at what level a certain drug will be absorbed into the body and allows them to determine proper dose size without having to go through a trial and error process currently the main use of this simulation is by scientists working with the fda the company also generates a small portion of revenue with research and consulting contracts simulations plus prides their selves on having speakers at over  scientific meetings worldwide in the past four years simulations plus made an acquisition of cognigen an industry leading globally recognized data analysis company this acquisition alone will add about  million to revenues next year a  increase expectations are for the company to grow revenues by about  including the cognigen acquisition this is expected to boost earnings per share by about  and is included in the earnings estimates mentioned below benefiting from a  plus growth industry the company is a small cap stock with just over  million in market cap  million in revenue zero debt and  in earnings per share i would like to compare it to others in its industry but many of its peers are not yet profitable  while simulations plus is going on its th consecutive quarterly profit after a record breaking year for  trying to find public companies that are similar to simulations plus practically doesnt exist the few that i found dont come anywhere close to  consecutive profit quarters a dividend or even positive earnings the reality is that its largest competitors are the same companies that buy its products  large pharmaceutical companies but we already know they havent been able to duplicate simulations plus programs whether they are patented or simulations plus can offer them at reasonable prices it still creates a competitive edge for the company versus its peers who are still trying to get a grasp on the industry this speaks to how well simulations plus products operate and how effective they are for their users if the company had a product that was underperforming expectations it would drive competition in the market but simulations plus said in its last years annual report that it doesnt see any real competitor to its flag ship product gastroplus this could change any day but i am confident simulations plus will continue to grow its branded products while still able to innovate with new products as it did with membraneplus simulations plus should continue to gain market share with its acquisition of cognigen and launch of membraneplus and while you wait you will collect the dividend yield of  despite only having a few public competitors the industry is in a strong growth phase according to a research study released earlier this year the compound average growth rate until  for the computational biology market is  it also points out that north america accounted for  of revenue in the industry for  but expects to see a faster growth rate in the asian regions with regards to simulations plus the company receives about  of revenues currently in asia and another  in europe it has an insignificant  from south america with north america taking the lead at  of revenues as you can see simulations plus is a global company and thus will benefit from the fast growth the report suggests we will see throughout asia an investment worth the risks as you may have noticed there are some obvious risks to the stock first large pharmaceutical companies could eventually do these simulations inhouse and sidestep simulations plus altogether now this is not the scenario i see playing out its simulations are some of the best in the industry and the company is even winning contracts with the fda a more likely scenario would be a buyout likely at a significant premium to the current price considering the competitive edge it has demonstrated in the current market  where none of the big pharmaceutical companies can mimic its simulations simply put large pharmaceutical companies already are simulations plus main competition and they havent replicated their processes yet second its a technology company with that there are always technological risks associated with a new product coming along and leap frogging their technology  but simulations plus is striving for the same goal to develop new innovative simulations if you can stomach the volatility that will follow this smallcap stock i would grab shares for less than  and ease my way into the stock leave some of your investment on the side and look to add to the position if shares drift lower than  right now shares are trading right around  because of the expected volatility in shares make sure you set a stoploss at a price you are not willing to lose more than since simulations plus turned into a profitable company in  it has traded with an average pe multiple of  but has traded closer to  of late their current earnings multiple is  and it trades at  times  earnings if we imply a  multiple to expected  earnings which is based on a consensus estimate of two analyst in capitaliq we get a stock price around  or  higher than todays price the company also dishes out a  current dividend yield which would give you an additional  in returns over the next two years so the base case scenario for the stock is nearly a  return in two years but the consensus target price by those two analysts is   above the current price without including dividends and the stock was trading  higher before the recent market rout and i expect shares to regain that drop in quick fashion if you are looking for a stable growth stock this is it as simulations plus wins new contracts and continues to make strategic acquisitions i believe we will see shares top estimates and generate a  plus return in less than two years ultimately i think this is a segment of the pharmaceutical industry that is poised for significant growth and the stock set to benefit dramatically is simulations plus every market is a traders market double or nothing
