the first time ever in  by  statista forecasts digital ad revenue from mobile will account for  billion compared to desktoplaptop ad revenue of  billion source statistacom one company that stands to not only benefit from this industry growth but also from taking a niche entertainment approach is bbooth inc otcqb bbth overview bbooth inc otcqb bbth hollywood californiabased bbooth inc otcqb bbth is an entertainment technology company through the company’s bnotifi technology bbooth inc otcqb bbth is the first company able to deliver direct “pushtoscreen” interactive video messaging and advertising content to mobile and desktop screens worldwide this technology is great for consumer brands looking for more effective ways to engage their customers or for music artists seeking to interact with their fans and promote their latest tracks or upcoming concerts due to the interactive nature of the technology brands artists and sales pros can now push ecommerce opportunities directly to their consumers’ screens assertively – instead of waiting passively for consumers to visit a website or click on a social media ad aside from consumer brands and music artists celebrities corporations governments schools health care providers and even presidential candidates could find bnotifi to be the most effective messaging brand activation lead generation and consumer engagement tool available today bbooth inc otcqb bbth is effectively creating a niche “push” advertising company that can increase user engagement for consumer branding and activation initiatives the bnotifi platform also serves as an effective sales lead generation tool for clients that utilize the technology unlike most app companies that need to wait for users to download their app the company is deploying a brilliant marketing strategy the company offers bnotifi as a whitelabeled product which is compatible with all mobile devices and desktop computers the technology is easily integrated into the applications and platforms of clients that already have a large userconsumer or fan base in other words experiencing the bnotifi service is simple the next time you download an update for some of your favorite apps and programs bnotifi may be embedded in it and with its licensing and per user monthly subscriptionbased pricing models bbooth inc otcqb bbth is well positioned for impressive revenue growth “experiencing” bnotifi technology is really the operative word imagine browsing for sunglasses on amazon not yet a client and then seeing nick cannon come walkingout onto your screen in a dlike image and telling you about the hottest styles trying them on and modeling them for you all without interrupting your browsing nick then tells you to click on the glasses he’s wearing – and bam – you just purchased them in fact how about if nick cannon or any other artist or celebrity walkedout onto your screen without your browser being open then the celebrity opens your browser to take you to a website for the latest news or information you optedin to bnotified about that is what’s so exciting about this technology that’s assertive technology and by the way nick cannon is actually part of the management team chief strategy officer and global brand ambassador and a major shareholder of bbooth inc otcqb bbth “bbooth inc otcqbbbth’s groundbreaking bnotifi pushtoscreen technology literally brings a person celebrity music artist brand spokesperson etc or a product to life directly on the screens of fans’ computers tablets and mobile devices around the globe bbooth’s unprecedented interactive technology is the new platform for content creation and distribution artist promotion fan engagement and brand activation with an increasing list of clientele including major consumer brands corporations music artists and celebrities bbooth is positioned to become hollywood’s thriving elite entertainment technology company” source bboothcom aside from its bnotifi video advertising platform bbooth inc otcqb bbth also offers its bbooth kiosks the bbooth kiosk is a unique form of “experiential entertainment” for truly interactive inyourface brand activations the kiosks are shaped like a giant smartphone and have builtin cameras and mics this allows users to record themselves singing karaoke or interacting with a brand right in a store or at the mall then with a tap on its huge touchscreen display users can share their videos and stills or gifs across their favorite social media with an advertiser’s branding embedded the kiosks are so cool and engaging that american idol deployed bbooth’s kiosks in shopping malls to handle the auditions for the show’s farewell season you’ll see them on other tv shows this fall through its bnotifi technology and its bbooth kiosks bbooth inc otcqb bbth is positioned for strong growth over the coming years management is forecasting fullyear  gross revenues of  million fullyear  gross revenues of  million and fullyear  gross revenues of  million  bbth star power nick cannon and frank thomas bbooth inc otcqb bbth is not only wellpositioned within the highgrowth market of digital advertising but the company has added an important entertainment factor that will help the company breakout from the rest of the pack the platform is impressive and its ability to deliver higher levels of userengagement makes it a musthave for businesses that are interested in advertising services that break through the noise in addition to producer writer director actor entrepreneur and shareholder nick cannon the company’s chief strategy officer and global brand ambassador bbooth inc otcqb bbth has also attracted major league baseball hall of famer frank thomas who serves on the company’s advisory board source pbstwimgcom the star power that nick cannon and frank thomas bring to bbooth inc otcqb bbth is enormous bbooth inc otcqb bbth’s technology is already impressive innovative and stateoftheart but with two big celebrities onboard it only adds to the potential the connections to the entertainment music and sports industries that nick cannon and frank thomas bring not only opens the door to greater brand awareness and recognition for bbooth inc otcqb bbth but also to greater revenue opportunities for instance imagine peyton manning walkingout on your screen with a “chicken parm” and advertising nationwide insurance services – and then walkingyou through fillingout the application right there on your screen another example could be taylor swift coming out onto your screen thanking you for being a fan and promoting her upcoming concerts just after you listened to one of her songs on a streaming music service maybe even adam sandler walkingout onto your computer screen while browsing movies on netflix inc nasdaq nflx and having him promote his next netflix original the possibilities and examples for how bnotifi can be used effectively to engage – not just reach – fans followers and target audiences are endless “imagine being able to communicate your message directly to the screens of your customers distributors team members fans and followers – in a mediarich interactive video format where the message is delivered by someone who appears to walk right out onto the desktop and mobile screens of your recipients – all without your recipients having to open a web browser or other mobile or desktop program” – nick cannon bbooth inc otcqb bbth’s chief strategy officer this…  is bnotifi bbth industry and financial analysis now we will take a look at bbooth inc otcqb

different channels ranging from managing basic contact information to tracking social media posts which is designed to give the sales person an ice breaker to a conversation with a prospect or client some of the players in the space such as zendesk inc nyse zen and pegasystems inc nasdaq pega offer free trials with services running upwards of  per month per user starting at that rate you’ll find hubspot inc’s nyse hubs basic services while salesforcecom inc’s nyse crm “unlimited edition” will take you up to  per month in the end they are all great tracking tools the help management keep track

months ended september   and   the expense has decreased as the majority of the technological development and design of our booths was incurred during  general and administrative expenses for the three months ended september   increased by  as compared to the three months ended september    the increase in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to amortization expense of  relating to our acquisition of the assets of songstagram inc songstagram in january  and share based compensation expense of   we did not have any of these expenses during the three months ended september     these increases to general and administrative expenses during the three months ended september   were offset by decreases in salary and related payroll expenses as compared to the same period in  due to the decrease in headcount as well as a decrease in other operating expenses such as rent expense consulting expense and professional fees incurred associated with our reverse merger

significant going forward as the technological development and design of our booths was incurred during  general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended september   increased by  as compared to the nine months ended september    the increase in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to amortization expense of  relating to the acquisition of the songstagram assets in
