for free  learn more how do i find the best architect for my home design projectit is best to hire a home architect who will be involved in all phases of the design process from the initial concept to the completed construction the architect is often the first person you will hire for your project if necessary they might also help you select and hire subcontractors which can include the builders engineers and landscaper interior architects are also involved in negotiating contracts for all involved participants it is for these reasons that it is extremely important for you to have a good relationship with the residential architect you hire he or she can be the tiebreaking vote between you and the general contractor and can be your biggest advocate during the construction process different architecture firms provide different services so the scope of the work can span from predesign environmental impact studies to selecting furniture and finishes depending on what your specific needs arewhat sort of process can i expect from a residential architectas far as the process goes the architecture firm or individual that you choose will start with concept drawings and finish with construction drawings and documents some firms even design with d renderings and videos but that should not be assumed there should be plenty of meetings between you and your building designer until you have agreed upon a design that you are completely happy with always keep in mind that the designer will have building codes to follow and likely preexisting design limitations when dealing with a remodel so while they might not be able to execute your exact ideas they always have your safety and aesthetics in mind one of the most important duties of a residential architect is to serve as managers and supervise most aspects of construction as well as facilitate communication between all other contractors so you can expect them to be present throughout the entire building process to ensure everything is executed as plannedit is very important to hire the right professional for the job remember that the most wellknown or established designer might not provide the best architectural services for your needs it all comes down to the individual project research and ask people whose work you like for recommendations its important to have somewhat of an idea of the style of house architecture that you prefer as well as the amount you would like to spend residential architects are natural problem solvers they will assess the entire situation and help you to solve your problems too dont settle for a single company too early call and interview a few make sure that you feel like your personalities will mesh well and that you like their professional perspectivequestions to ask prospective interior architects what is your fee structure what does the cost include do you have professional liability insurance can you handle my special requests ada leed etc what types of renderings d video illustrative will you produce what is your experience with similar projects when do you expect to start and be finished with the project what do your services include its best that the services are until construction is completed what happens when the cost exceeds the budget can you provide me with references would you say your work has a defining style this is important in case the architects personal style will interfere with your vision will you help with hiring a general contractor and subcontractors what do you estimate the cost will be what will i need to provide are there any complications you foresee with this projectfind a home architect on houzz narrow your search in the professionals section of the website to architects you may also
