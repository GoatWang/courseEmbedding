impeached but like watergate this procedure will take my personal opinion up to a couple years if not more but let’s go back a little and ask ourselves if donald trump junior claims that he is crystal clear why is it that he never rushed to the fbi immediately letting them know that somebody had contacted him offering him what they did why did he not contact any federal officials in any way whatsoever and if it was donald trump junior himself that brought this on the white house why is it that we have the president of the united states of america studies claiming that this is a witch hunt on the on the media this is a tsunami that just hit the oval office   weeks ago • white house scandals donald trump to meet with vladimir putin today donald trump to meet with his best friend ever behind closed doors in just a few hours from now along with them will be only two translators and the american translator is under oath that anything that said in the meeting is to be revealed in any way whatsoever that makes perfect sense what will be on the agenda i can speculate if you want trump will offer to remove all sanctions on russia will reveal without knowing some of our countries most classified secrets and in exchange he will get absolutely nothing lol it is clear at this time that pres putin is completely in control of the meeting all his demands will be taken down and executed and most probably the united states even if they have any demands of their own will be as usual ignored by the exsoviet union kgb officer vladimir putin wants this meeting so that he can lay down his authority on donald trump i myself find it very hard to understand why it donald trump wants to protect this country but at the same time will sit down with vladimir putin and refuse to point his finger and accusing him of leaving the hacking during the  elections i know for a fact that nothing will be said or done if you consider that no sanctions have been given since that hacking attack no action has been taken no action will ever be taken best friends forever donnie and vlad   weeks ago • donnie trump’s approval rating plummets after senate releases health care bill president donald trump’s approval rating plummeted over the weekend as controversy continues to swirl around senate republican’s revised health care bill just  percent of americans now say they approve of the job the president is doing in office a drop of four points in just three days according to the latest gallup survey released on sunday trump’s disapproval also increased by three points up to  percent after sinking as low as  percent a few weeks ago trump’s numbers bounced back last week reaching as high as  percent approval — a near monthlong high for the president however the president’s approval rating began to dive again following the backlash that erupted after senate republicans released their revised obamacare replacement bill not only has the bill faced harsh criticism from democratic lawmakers but top republicans in the senate including rand paul ted cruz and mike lee all revealed in a joint statement they were “not ready to vote for this bill” “there’s no way we should be voting on this next week no way” republican sen ron johnson said on sunday “i have a hard time believing wisconsin constituents or even myself will have enough time to properly evaluate this for me to vote for a motion to proceed so i’ve been encouraging leadership the white house anybody i can talk to for quite some time let’s not rush this process let’s have the integrity to show the american people what it is show them the truth” the president however says he remains confident health care reform will get done and soon “i don’t think they’re that far off famous last words right but i think we’re going to get there” trump said in an interview sunday on fox news’ “fox  friends”   month ago • donnie trump and twitter what a circus act now don’t get me wrong i love twitter i have my own account under my thomas f cheng name as you can see i have a bunch of social media accounts on all the platforms it is a matter of fact i love social media more than my job or any other activity however i have never made a complete fool of my self by posting total stupidity however i can’t talk for everyone and most of all for the president of this great nation of ours every time that the man takes to twitter he makes a true fool of himself even more than he actually is now he’s tweeting that he’s the victim of an investigation that see’s him in the center of it all why worry if you’re clean the investigators will prove that you have nothing to do with foulplay so chill don’t get mad well the word is he is going to fire the special prosecutor robert mueller that his days are counted and that should actually take place this week how will that look for trump after that he fires the man investigating him well with the rest of the world and the large majority of the americans it would look terrible and would prove in all points his guilt but to him and the avid trash that supports him it was the right thing to do lol lets stay on top of this and see where it goes   month ago • donnie what is comey going to say today well it’s pretty sure what he is going to state in his live testimony and it seems that the president could get roasted and this time pretty badly but this is america so anything could happen really with the gop that has the lead in both house and senate you never know however because the whole world is watching and the us wants to keep some and i state some credibility then maybe whatever is said today they should act on it and if trump and his buddies have put there nose where they shouldn’t have then that is obstruction of justice and they all need to be removed and punished follow me also on thethomas f chang facebook page as i’ll be posting during todays show   months ago • donnie donald trumps international tour he bowed to the saudi’s will not physically but morally he definitely did of course when there is a  billion deal going down his friends say who wouldn’t right then he heads off to israel and talks about about the saudi then he heads off to palestine and told bad about the jews then he goes to europe at the g summit and basically doesn’t confirm any climate deal and leaves all the european leaders thinking with this guy i want anyone with us to the point where the german chancellor stated that from now on europe will have to make its own decisions without the united states and maybe we should look towards canada as a future ally we all saw what pope francis thoughts on our gracious president he couldn’t wait to get the man out of the building lol then he comes back like he has always done being viciously attacks the free press but this time like no other time even if the people that he chose to be in his cabinet are telling him to stop he continues on a daily basis to unconstitutionally the press tv networks and reporters let’s talk about statistics is solid ground all three months ago that sold the president with a  approval is now down to  something you telling me many of his fans are abandoning him and only the foolish are actually still there supporting this man in my personal opinion what about russiagate why is the white house so quiet about all this why are they not saying a word to the press about this what do they have to hide or better still how much do they have to hide that we have no idea about my only hope is that the special prosecutor will not only find the responsible of this treason but will find in first person the direct involvement of our presidents and he will be impeached immediately   months ago • uncategorized impeachment of trump and his circus when many say that it’s not a matter of “if” but rather “when” will donald trump be impeached federal investigations bring up every day new facts that the trump administration was deeply involved in relations with russia and the hacking that took place during the elections a lot of my friends say that thomas f cheng me could get himself in a lot of trouble for saying certain things then prove me worng tell me what i’m saying that is not the truth… the most wonderful thing about this country is that you can speak your mind as long as you don’t insult someone and thats what i’m doing so yes he will be impeached as this is the same way watergate went who was around back then knows that there is no way out of this trump knows and knew the whole time what was going on and that the elections like he stated many times “were rigged” but to his benefit   months ago • donnie what happened with the harsh words trump used against all muslims the reason why this man won the elections is because his whole campaign was based on hatred his whole campaign was based on getting rid of muslims in the united states and therefore every single ignorant rednecks in the country gave him their vote the rural parts of the country that was not a single trailer park where he didn’t win i am thomas f cheng i stand by my words this man wanted to block any muslim from entering the country and then yesterday he sat beside the king of saudi arabia okay there was  billion deal that went down as well so i guess he has to bite his tongue what happened about cleaning out the swamp what happened about the wall what about changing completely and repealing obama care one would say that obama care repealing is right around the corner but even then you would be wrong they are delaying it because they know that it will never pass the senate so besides the hardcore donald trump stands that are deaf and blind the remaining  of them that actually gave donald trump their vote on not really that happy with him and every day that goes by all the mountain of lies that he said during his campaign all the bs that he filled their minds with never came true at all expect a lot more expect him to bow down and not follow up in any way whatsoever with what he promised all the trailer trash of this country that fell for his liesand now i’ll pay a dear price just like we all are just like them but didn’t want this person at the oval office   months ago • donnie was the fbi director getting too close… you’re fired like i stated months ago on the thomas f cheng trump would have fired comey it wasn’t a matter of “if” but better still “when” the former fbi director was praised just a few months ago when he helped trump win the election when he came out only  days before the elections stating that he was looking into the hilary clinton email scandal once again but in the past month he was investigating the connections between the russian government and the trump crew that go the donnie a little nervous is there something that the prez didn’t want the fbi to discover just look at who he has fired since he made office… i don’t need to put the puzzle together anyone that actually has a little bit of brain can actually put that together and see whats going on here who’s next on the list   months ago • donnie bernie sanders states that the new hc bill will not pass the senate the new bill a bill that helps insurance companies get rid of you if you get sick a bill that will bring back preexisting cause so lets say that you’re diabetic and you were before signing up for your health insurance plan now the company can drop you as soon as the plan is law then we have the the new borns as soon as they’re born the insurance companies can deny all care in the first  months of that son or daughter of yours i could go on for days with this bs this is what the british have called “the bill of evil” basically what we have here is that the very rich are the only ones that will have full coverage and the insurance companies will make around  billion a year in savings so once again the fools that voted for trump will now find themselves in the middle of this… …well if you consider that  of veterans voted for him now their going to close all va’s and have you put on a health insurance bill where you’ll pay just like the rest of us then the  of senior citizens that also voted for the orange man they’ll see themselves rejected from hospitals for old age sickness that btw is also in the bill so at the end of the day we all lose out but most of all the idiots that voted him in will pay the biggest price our only hope is like bernie sanders said that to stop this horrible reality at the senate they need all democrats and  republicans to stop it it seems that they have the numbers but not a lot will change and all that they’ll do is take it back to the table make a few pathetic adjustments and then repropose it again for the next  and a half years   months ago • donnie      »
