is located in the southwest region of crystal the local passion for preserving and protecting the bassett creek waters and parkland give this neighborhood a unifying voice that distinguishes it from other parts of the city with minneapolis to the southeast the neighborhood lies close enough to the city to feel metropolitan but as the active bassett creek park group reminds residents the neighborhood is still small enough to bond together folks looking for a cheerful and comfortable home with urban access should look no further learn more about bassett creek  granite cliffs gallery
