growth for shares of a alger allcap and b salomon variable all cap held by subaccounts of the separate accounts each a “substitution” and together the “substitutions”  the investment objectives and principal investment policies of the replacement fund and the substituted portfolios are as follows ameritas income  growth primarily seeks to provide a high level of dividend income with a secondary goal to provide capital appreciation by investing in dividend paying equity securities such as common or preferred stocks preferably those which the subadviser believes also offer opportunities for capital appreciation alger allcap seeks longterm capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of companies of any size which demonstrate promising growth potential salomon variable all cap seeks capital appreciation by investing primarily in securities which the manager believes have aboveaverage capital appreciation potential a secondary consideration is given to a companys dividend

will have lower total expense ratios than they currently have in the substituted funds moreover there will be no increase in contract fees and expenses including mortality and expense risk fees and administration and distribution fees charged to the separate accounts as a result of the substitutions applicants believe that if the proposed substitutions are implemented the core investment goals of affected contract owners will not be frustrated and the investment expectations of affected contract owners can continue to be met applicants expect that the substitutions will provide significant benefits to contract owners including improved selection of portfolio managers and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination of overlapping offerings applicants state that ameritas considered the performance history of the substituted funds and the replacement funds and determined that no contract owners would be materially adversely affected as a result of the substitutions applicants believe that the substitutions each of which replaces outside funds with a fund for which ameritas investment acts as investment advisor will permit ameritas investment under a multimanager order granted by the commission and under shareholder approval previously obtained to hire monitor and replace subadvisers as necessary to seek optimal performance and to ensure a consistent investment style applicants further believe that the subadviser to the replacement fund is better positioned to provide consistent aboveaverage performance for its fund than the adviser or subadvisers of the substituted funds applicants state that contract owners will continue to be able to select among a large number of funds with a full range of investment objectives investment strategies and managers applicants believe there will also be a significant savings to contract owners because certain costs such as the costs of printing and mailing lengthy periodic reports and prospectuses for

fund its advisors or underwriters or from affiliates of the new funds their advisors or underwriters in connection with assets attributable to contracts affected by the substitutions at a higher rate

shareholder service or administrative or other service fees revenue sharing or other arrangements collectively “revenue arrangements” applicants represent that the substitutions and the selection of the new fund was not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to applicants or any affiliate of applicants by the new fund its advisors underwriters or affiliates  the proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts applicants expect that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of a substituted fund and reinvesting the proceeds of such redemption in shares of the replacement fund through a combination of cash and “in kind” transactions  contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or ameritas obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by ameritas in addition the proposed substitutions will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because the proposed substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a contract year  following the date on which ameritas is notified that the notice of the application is to be published in the federal register but before the date on which the order requested by the application becomes effective ameritas will send to affected contract owners notice “substitution notice” the substitution notice will inform affected contract owners of a the effective date of the

permit affected contract owners to make transfers of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the start printed page replacement fund subaccount to another subaccount without the transfer or

owners a second written notice “confirmation notice” the confirmation notice will a confirm that the substitutions were carried out b reiterate that each affected contract owner may transfer all of the contract value or cash value under a contract that is invested in a substituted fund to any other subaccount available under their contract without such transfer being subject to any administrative charge or being counted as one of the “free transfers” or one of the limited number of transfers to which affected contract owners may be entitled under the contracts and c state that other than with respect to “market timing” activity described above ameritas will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the effective date  for those who were contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions ameritas and ameritas investment will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the date of the proposed substitutions the subaccount investing in the replacement fund such that the sum of the replacement funds operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses assetbased fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the replacement funds operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses for the fiscal year preceding the date of the proposed substitutions in addition for twentyfour months following the proposed substitutions ameritas and ameritas investment will not increase separate account fees or charges for contracts outstanding on the date of the proposed substitutions applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act provides in pertinent part that “it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission shall have approved such substitution” section c of the  act also provides that the commission shall issue an order approving such substitutions if the evidence establishes that the substitutions are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the  act  the contracts expressly reserve to ameritas the right subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a subaccount of the separate accounts applicants assert that the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right  in each case applicants believe that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for the substituted fund in this regard applicants contend that the proposed replacement fund for each substituted fund has an investment objective that is at least substantially similar to that of the substituted fund applicants also assert that the principal investment policies of the replacement funds are similar to those of the corresponding substituted funds in addition with respect to each proposed substitution applicants note that affected contract owners with balances invested in the replacement fund will have a lower or the same expense ratio in all cases  applicants anticipate that contract owners will be better off with the array of subaccounts offered after the proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of subaccounts offered prior to the substitutions the proposed substitutions retain for contract owners the investment flexibility which is a central feature of the contracts if the proposed substitutions are carried out all contract owners will be permitted to allocate purchase payment and transfer contract values and cash values between and among approximately the same number of subaccounts as they could before the proposed substitutions moreover the elimination of the costs of printing and mailing prospectuses and periodic reports of the substituted funds will benefit contract owners  applicants note that contract owners who do not wish to participate in a replacement fund will have an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value among other available subaccounts without the imposition of any charge or limitation other than with respect to “market timing” activity  applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of section c of the  act and that the requested order should be granted  sections a and  of the  act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated persons of any such affiliated person or any principal underwriter for such company collectively “transaction affiliates” from selling a security to or purchasing a security from the registered investment company applicants may be deemed to be transaction affiliates of one another based upon the definition of “affiliated person” under section a of the  act because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between transaction affiliates  section b provides that the commission may grant an application exempting proposed transactions from the prohibitions of section a if the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the transaction is consistent with the investment policies of each registered investment company concerned and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act applicants state that the consideration to be paid by the replacement fund and each of the substituted funds will be fair and reasonable and will not involve overreaching because the substitutions will not result in the dilution of the interests of any affected contract owners and will not effect any change in economic interest contract value or the dollar value of any variable contract held by an affected contract owner  in addition applicants state that to the extent the substitutions are effected by redeeming shares of the substituted funds and using the redemption proceeds to purchase shares of the replacement funds the substitutions will satisfy each of the procedural safeguards adopted by the board of directors responsible for each of the ameritas portfolios and the substituted funds respectively under rule a under the  act applicants conclusion applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above the proposed substitutions and

models however you have the ability to construct your own asset allocation plan from among the investment options available in your policy asset allocation programs using models are intended to match model risk tolerance and investment objectives with the investment options available in your policy to assist you in your selection of an asset allocation model we offer an asset allocation program the program the program consists of models that were developed by an unaffiliated third party investment adviser the unaffiliated third party investment adviser provided research and business support services relating to the models and selected the specific funds to populate each model from those available in the policy ameritas life paid for these consultant services at no additional cost to the policy owners ameritas investment corp aic an affiliate of ours has served as discretionary investment adviser for program participants solely in connection with the development and periodic updates to the model portfolios in this regard aic has entered into an investment advisory agreement with each policy owner participating in the program in its role as investment adviser aic relied upon the recommendations of third parties to provide research and business support services and select the specific funds to populate the models aics role as investment adviser for development of and periodic updates to the models will terminate on august   and the models in the program will no longer undergo periodic updates important information concerning the asset allocation program after august   on and after august   the models in the program will no longer undergo periodic updates the models will become static the investment advisory agreement you have previously entered into with aic will terminate and aic will no longer make updates to the models policy owners will receive notice of the termination of their investment advisory agreement and additional notice that the models are becoming static the models will remain invested in accordance with the most recent model allocations you may continue rebalancing your allocation among the funds in your particular static model on a quarterly basis you will not be required to take any action if you wish to continue participating in a static model you may allocate to a different static model or discontinue participating in static models after august  to participate in the program you are responsible for determining which model is best for you your financial adviser can help you make this determination and may provide you with an investor questionnaire to help you define your investing style there is no guarantee that the model you select is appropriate to your ability to withstand investment risk we are not responsible for your selection of a specific investment option or model or your decision to change to a different investment option you must allocate all of your policy value to one asset allocation model we must receive notice of your asset allocation model election by written notice before we can begin a program for you only you can select which model is best for you the asset allocation questionnaire can be an aid but is just a tool you will make your own selection you may wish to consult with your own financial professional to determine whether participation in the program is best for you and if so which model is most suitable in if you are currently participating in a program model and you make changes to your allocations outside the model you will be considered as having withdrawn from the program you will be required to communicate with the service center if you wish to make a transfer or trade the service center will communicate that your election to execute a trade will result in the discontinuance of the program for your policy prior to you being able to execute any telephone transaction you may participate in quarterly rebalancing where each quarter we will automatically rebalance the subaccount values to be consistent with the allocation percentages for the program model that you selected such rebalancing will be disclosed in quarterly statements to you performance of each model is updated monthly on our website and is available upon request the program consists of five models ranging from aggressive to conservative on and after august   the static models will retain these descriptions aggressive model the aggressive model is for longterm investors who want high growth potential and do not need current income the model may entail substantial yeartoyear volatility in exchange for potentially higher longterm returns losses are still possible capital growth model the capital growth model is for longterm investors who want good growth potential and do not need current income the model entails a fair amount of volatility but not as much as the aggressive model losses are still possible balanced model the balanced model is for longterm investors who do not need current income and want some growth potential the model is likely to entail some fluctuations but presents less volatility than the overall equity market losses are still possible moderate model the moderate model is for investors who seek current income and stability with modest potential for increase in the value of their investments losses are still possible conservative model the conservative model is for investors who seek current income and stability and are less concerned about growth losses are still possible the adding deleting or substituting variable investment options section describes how changes to the subaccounts underlying portfolios will be addressed once the program becomes static potential conflicts of interest relating to program models we and our affiliates managed the competing interests that had the potential to influence the decision making with regard to the models by engaging a third party investment adviser to design the models and select the investment options for such models such competing interests include the following aic is compensated by us as principal underwriter for the policies and as a distributor for a majority of our policies calvert variable products inc and calvert variable series inc the calvert funds have portfolios offered through the policy the calvert funds are advised by calvert investment management inc cim an affiliate of ours and certain of the calvert funds are subadvised by ameritas investment partners inc aip also an affiliate of ours cim and aip are compensated for administrative advisory and subadvisory services they provide to calvert funds calvert fund portfolios may or may not be included in the models we may receive administrative services fees from other portfolios that are available as investment options or distribution fees as a result of these competing interests the affiliated parties faced in this program there was an increased potential risk of a conflict of interest in these arrangements there is no additional charge for selecting the program although asset allocation programs are intended to mitigate investment risk there is a risk that investing pursuant to a model will still result in losses the models will remain unchanged thus the percentages of your policy value allocated to each portfolio within the selected model will not be changed by us and subsequent purchase payments will be invested in the same model unless we receive new instructions over time the static model you select may no longer align with its original investment

would be no tax consequences resulting from this exchange after the substitution the subaccount funded by the existing fund will no longer be available for investment under the policy once the

paragraphs are added to your prospectus separate account and transfers sections resolving material conflicts underlying investment interests in addition to serving as underlying portfolios to the subaccounts the portfolios are available to registered separate accounts of other insurance companies offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts we do not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the fund companies selling portfolio shares to fund other products however there is a possibility that a material conflict of interest may arise between policy owners and the owners of variable contracts issued by other companies whose values are allocated to one of the portfolios shares of some of the portfolios may also be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans qualifying under section  of the internal revenue code as a result there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of owners or owners of other contracts including contracts issued by other companies and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans in the event of a material conflict we will take any necessary steps to resolve the matter including removing that portfolio as an underlying investment option of the separate account the board of directors of each fund company will monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts that may arise and determine what action if any should be taken in response to those events or conflicts see the accompanying prospectuses of the portfolios for more information omnibus orders purchase and redemption orders received by the portfolios generally are omnibus orders from intermediaries such as retirement plans and separate accounts funding variable insurance products the omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual retirement plan participants and individual owners of variable insurance products the omnibus nature of these orders may limit the ability of the portfolios to apply their respective disruptive trading policies and procedures we cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to the retirement plans or other insurance companies that may invest in the portfolios these other insurance companies are responsible for their own policies and procedures regarding frequent transfer activity if their policies and procedures fail to successfully discourage harmful transfer activity it will affect other owners of portfolio shares as well as the owners of all variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts including ours whose variable investment options correspond to the affected portfolios in addition if a portfolio believes that an omnibus order that we submit may reflect one or more transfer requests from owners engaged in disruptive trading the portfolio may reject the entire omnibus order and thereby delay or prevent us from implementing your request any references to mixed and shared funding are deleted from the prospectus  references to rule h are deleted and replaced with the following text ameritas relies on the exemption provided by rule h to file reports under the securities exchange act of the model asset allocation section of your prospectus is deleted and replaced with the following asset allocation program we may offer an asset allocation program using models however you always have the ability to construct your own asset allocation plan from among the investment options available in your policy asset allocation programs using models are intended to match model risk tolerance and investment objectives with the investment options available in your policy to assist you in your selection of an asset allocation model our asset allocation program the program uses fundspecific model recommendations developed by our affiliate summit investment advisors inc sia these recommendations are offered to you through an agreement between ameritas and sia the program consists of five models ranging from aggressive to conservative sia provides ameritas investment corp aic our majority owned subsidiary with ongoing recommendations and monitoring of the portfolios that comprise the models to participate in the program aic will serve as your investment adviser fiduciary for the program solely for purposes of development of the models and periodic updates to the models you must give aic your written consent and discretionary authority for aic to give us instructions to allocate your premiums or for an existing policy policy value pursuant to the allocations of the model you select aic will also periodically instruct us to change your allocations consistent with any changes to the model made by aic as recommended by sia aic has no discretionary authority to execute any other transfers for your policy in  you must complete the asset allocation questionnaire you must allocate all of your policy value to one asset allocation model we must receive notice of your asset allocation model election by written notice before we can begin a program for you only you can select which model is best for you the asset allocation questionnaire can be an aid but neither it nor aic will make this decision for you you may wish to consult with your own financial professional to determine whether participation in the program is best for you and if so which model is most suitable each quarter we will automatically rebalance the subaccount values to be consistent with the allocation percentages for the program model that you selected such rebalancing will be disclosed in quarterly statements to you performance of each model is updated daily on our website and is available upon request at least annually aic will reevaluate and may make changes to each investment level model based upon sia s recommendations when aic updates the models we will send you written notice of the updated models at least  days in advance of the date the updated models are to be effective if you wish to accept the changes in your selected model you will not need to take any action as your policy value and any subsequent premium will be automatically reallocated pursuant to the updated model if you do not wish to accept the changes to your selected model you can change to a different model or withdraw from the program if you are currently participating in a program model and you make changes to your allocations outside the model you will not receive future notifications of model changes you will then be considered as having withdrawn from the program and as having cancelled your relationship with aic for purposes of implementing the program with your policy for this reason you will not be able to execute trades online if you participate in the program you will be required to talk to a service center representative if you are in the program but wish to make a transfer or trade the service center representative will explain to you prior to executing any telephone transaction that your election to execute a trade will result in the discontinuance of the program for your policy if participation in the program terminates including by death of the owner policy value will not be reallocated automatically if the model is changed and thus will not reflect the most current allocation recommendations any additional premiums received after the death of the owner will be returned potential conflicts of interest aic and sia may be subject to competing interests that have the potential to influence their decision making with regard to the models aic is compensated by us as principal underwriter for the policies sia is compensated by us for its fundspecific model recommendations and its ongoing oversight of the available investment options we and aic may receive fees for administrative services from other portfolios in the models this additional compensation and related responsibilities may create conflicts of interest as aic determines what portfolios should be in the models also calvert variable products inc and calvert variable series inc the calvert funds which are part of the unifi mutual holding company and therefore are affiliated with us have portfolios offered through the policy the calvert funds are advised by calvert asset management company inc camco an affiliate of ours and certain of the calvert funds are subadvised by summit investment partners inc summit also an affiliate of ours camco and summit are compensated for advisory oversight subadvisory and administrative services calvert fund portfolios may or may not be included in the models sia may have an incentive to recommend certain portfolios that have administrative advisory or subadvisory services provided by camco and summit as a result of the competing interests the affiliated parties face in this program there is an increased potential risk of a conflict of interest in these arrangements there is no additional charge for selecting the program although asset allocation programs are intended to mitigate investment risk there is a risk that investing pursuant to a model will still lose value for information about risks of participating in the program and more detail about the program including more information about conflicts of interest ask for a copy of the separate accounts statement of additional information more information about aic s role as investment adviser for the program is available on aic s form adv part ii which is delivered to you at the time you subscribe to the program we may modify or discontinue the asset allocation program at any time  the model asset allocation section of your statement of additional information is deleted and replaced with the following asset allocation program the service ameritas investment corp aic a majority owned subsidiary of ameritas has developed several asset allocation models each based on different profiles of an investor s willingness to accept investment risk and provided exclusively through our policies as the asset allocation program the program aic periodically typically annually evaluates and updates the models in developing and periodically updating the models aic in  currently relies on the fundspecific model recommendations made by summit investment advisors inc sia a registered investment advisor which like ameritas is wholly owned by ahc and ultimately by unifi aic may change the firm it uses or as is currently the case may use no independent firm when developing the models for the program if you choose to subscribe to the program aic will serve as your investment adviser solely for purposes of development of the program models and periodic updates of the models if you choose to subscribe to the program aic instructs us to allocate your initial premium in the case of a new application or accumulated value as applicable to the investment options according to the model you select to similarly allocate subsequent premium and to periodically automatically reallocate your accumulated value or premium payments your policy value will be rebalanced quarterly consistent with your selected model the asset allocation program models development of the program models is a twostep process first sia performs an optimization analysis to determine the breakdown of asset classes next after the asset class exposures are known a determination is made of how available investment options can be used to implement the asset class level allocations investment options are selected in a way intended to optimize potential returns for each model given a particular level of risk tolerance sia may also choose passively managed index investment options to optimize returns for a given risk profile sias philosophy on selecting active investment managers centers on choosing experienced managers that add value over time using a consistent process and staying on mandate across market cycles when selecting investment options sia looks for competitive fees tenured fund management and total returns that are competitive to their peers sia avoids managers holding offmandate exposures or other significant portfolio concentrations that could lead to sharp performance deviations this process could in some cases result in the inclusion of an investment option in a model based on its specific asset class exposure or other specific optimization factors even where another investment option may have better historical performance periodic updates of the models and notices of updates each model is evaluated periodically generally annually to assess whether the combination of investment options within each model should be changed to better seek to optimize the potential return for the level of risk tolerance intended for the model as a result each model may change and the investment options used within a model may change when your selected model is updated aic instructs us to automatically reallocate your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments in accordance with any changes to the model you have selected this means the allocation of your accumulated value and potentially the investment options in which you are invested will automatically change and your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments will be automatically reallocated among the investment options in your updated model independently of the automatic quarterly rebalancing aic requires that you give it discretionary investment authority to periodically instruct us to reallocate your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments in accordance with the updated version of the model you have selected if you wish to participate in the program when aic updates the models we will send you written notice of the updated models at least  days in advance of the date the updated models are to be effective if you wish to accept the changes in your selected model you will not need to take any action as your policy value and any subsequent premium will be automatically reallocated pursuant to the updated model if you do not wish to accept the changes to your selected model you can change to a different model or withdraw from the program risks although asset allocation models are designed to optimize returns given the various levels of risk there is no assurance that a model portfolio will not lose money or that investment results will not experience volatility investment performance of your accumulated value could be better or worse by participating in a program model than if you had not participated a model may perform better or worse than any single investment option or asset class or other combinations of investment options or asset classes model performance is dependent upon the performance of the component investment options and their underlying portfolios the timing of your investment and the automatic quarterly rebalancing may affect performance your accumulated value will fluctuate and when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost periodic updating of the models can cause the underlying portfolios to incur transaction expenses to raise cash for money flowing out of the portfolios or to buy securities with money flowing into the portfolios these expenses can adversely affect performance of the pertinent portfolios and the models in  view more similar documents ameritas life insurance corp ameritas life ameritas variable separate account vl

extraordinary expenses only the board of directors of cvsi may terminate a portfolios expense cap before the contractual period expires the advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of  or  for net operating expenses of  to maintain a positive yield during the year ended december    the applicants state that the proposed substitution is in response to a decision by the board of directors for cvsi at a meeting held on june   to approve the dissolution of the current portfolio on or about november   the “liquidation date” the boards decision to liquidate the current portfolio requires the life insurance companies to transfer accumulated contract value invested in the current portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the contracts on or before the liquidation date currently the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the contracts is the current portfolio accordingly the proposed substitution is necessary in order to provide the contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option consequently the life insurance companies have determined to replace the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio via the substitution  the life insurance companies submit that the replacement portfolio is an appropriate alternative for contract owners for several reasons first its investment objectives strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the current portfolio second it is substantially larger than the current portfolio has had lower overall expense levels than the portfolio in recent years and has had higher yields in recent years than the current portfolio third the contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the life insurance companies currently offer one or more vipfv portfolios other than the replacement portfolio  the applicants believe that contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the replacement portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the replacement portfolio as contrasted start printed page with the size and recent yields of the current portfolio the yield for the current portfolio for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the current portfolio was  as of december   the yield for the replacement portfolio initial class shares for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the replacement portfolio supporting initial class shares was  as of december    the applicants believe that contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the replacement portfolio as compared to the current portfolio specifically the management fee other expenses and total operating expenses are less than those of the current portfolio both portfolios have no charge for rule b distribution and services fees the total annual operating expense of the replacement portfolio is less than that of the current portfolio given this decrease the applicants believe that the substitution would benefit contract owners by reducing the overall level of portfolio expenses legal analysis and conditions  the applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitution section c of the  act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust  applicants submit that the proposed substitution is not the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent section c was intended to provide for commission scrutiny of a proposed substitution which could in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption consequently the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holders only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security or to elect a costly and in effect forced redemption  applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include section c  applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times all redemptions of shares of the current portfolio and purchases of shares of the replacement portfolio will be effected in accordance with section c of the act and rule c thereunder the substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the substitution “effective date” with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her

substitution will be notified in writing that the substitution was carried out this notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the presubstitution notice and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio were transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge start printed page including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge  the applicants represent that the life insurance companies will not receive for three  years after the effective date any direct or indirect benefits from the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates in connection with assets attributable to the contracts affected by the substitution at a higher rate than the life insurance companies had received from the current portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates including without limitation b fees revenue sharing or other arrangements the applicants further represent that the substitution and the selection of the replacement portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a life insurance company or its affiliates by the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates  applicants submit that the replacement of the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio is consistent with the protection of contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and thus meets the standards necessary to support an order

policy monthly anniversary o cost of insurance charge the cost of insurance rate per  of net amount at risk cannot exceed the guaranteed cost of insurance rate that is set forth in the policy the maximum cost of insurance each month can be determined by using the guaranteed cost of insurance rate in the formula below for cost of insurance the cost of insurance charge is for providing insurance protection under the policy because the cost of insurance charge depends upon several variables the cost for each policy month can vary from month to month the cost of insurance rate for the initial face amount of insurance coverage varies by the insureds sex issue age risk class and the length of time the policy has been in force the cost of insurance rate for an increase in face amount varies by the insureds sex age and risk class at the time of the increase and the length of time the policy has been in force since the increase we may use current cost of insurance rates less than those shown in the policy and reserve the right to change them so long as they do not exceed the rates shown in the policy changes will equally apply to similarly situated policy owners and be based on changes in future expectations of factors such as investment earnings mortality persistency and expenses we expect a profit from this charge ask for a policy illustration or see your policy for these charges applicable to you the cost of insurance each month equals  the net amount at risk for the month multiplied by  the cost of insurance rate per  of net amount at risk divided by   the net amount at risk in any month equals  the death benefit on the policy monthly anniversary discounted at the guaranteed rate of interest for the fixed account for one month minus  the policy value on the policy

charge is for the mortality risks we assume  that insureds may live for shorter periods of time than we estimate and also compensates us for the policy expense risks we assume if this charge exceeds

beneficiary generally and except as provided for in some states a minor may not own the policy solely in the minors name and cannot receive payments directly as a policy beneficiary contrary to common belief in most states parental status does not automatically give parents the power to provide an adequate release to us to make beneficiary payments to the parent for the minors benefit a minor can own a policy through the trustee of a trust established for the minors benefit or through the minors named and court appointed guardian who owns the policy in his or her capacity as trustee or guardian where a minor is a named beneficiary we are able to pay the minors beneficiary payments to the minors trustee or guardian some states allow us to make such payments up to a limited amount directly to parents parents seeking to have a minors interest made payable to them for the minors benefit are encouraged to check with their local court to determine the process to be appointed as the minors guardian it is often a very simple process that can be accomplished without the assistance of an attorney if there is no adult representative able to give us an adequate release for payment of the minors beneficiary interest we will retain the minors interest on deposit until the minor attains the age of majority policy changes any change to your policy is only effective if on a form

affecting the policy are complex may change and are affected by your facts and circumstances we cannot guarantee the tax treatment of the policy or any transaction involving the policy you should consult your own tax adviser as to how these general rules and any applicable taxes will apply to you if you purchase a policy life insurance qualification tax treatment of death benefit the internal revenue code as amended the code defines a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes this definition can be met if an insurance contract satisfies either one of two tests the code and related regulations do not directly address the manner in which these tests should be applied to certain features of the policy thus there is some uncertainty about how those tests apply to the policy nevertheless we believe the policy qualifies as a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes so that o the death benefit should be fully excludable from the beneficiarys gross income and o you should not be considered in constructive receipt of the cash surrender value including any increases in cash surrender value unless and until it is distributed from the policy we reserve the right to make such changes in the policy as we deem necessary to assure it qualifies as a life insurance contract under the code and continues to provide the tax benefits of such qualification modified endowment contracts the code establishes a class of life insurance contracts designated as modified endowment contracts the code rules governing whether a policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract are extremely complex in general a policy is a modified endowment contract if the accumulated premium payments made at any time during the first seven policy years exceed the sum of the net level premium payments which would have been paid on or before such time if the policy provided for paidup future benefits after the payment of seven level annual premiums a policy may also become a modified endowment contract because of a material change the determination of whether a policy is a modified endowment contract after a material change generally depends upon the relationship of the policys death benefit and policy value at the time of such change and the additional premium payments made in the seven years following the material change a policy may also become a modified endowment contract if the death benefit is reduced this policys flexibility and how you tailor it to meet your needs could cause it to be a modified endowment contract we recommend you consult with a tax adviser to determine if desired policy transactions may cause such treatment when a premium payment is credited which we believe causes the policy to become a modified endowment contract we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to request a refund of that premium in order to avoid such treatment you have  days after receiving such a notice to request the refund a policy issued in exchange for a modified endowment contract is subject to tax treatment as a modified endowment contract however we believe that a policy issued in exchange for a life insurance policy that is not a modified endowment contract will generally not be treated as a modified endowment contract if the death benefit of the policy is greater than or equal to the death benefit of the policy being exchanged the payment of any premiums at the time of or after the exchange may however cause the policy to become a modified endowment contract you may of course choose to not make additional payments in order to prevent a policy from being treated as a modified endowment contract special considerations for corporations premium paid by a business for a life insurance policy is not deductible as a business expense or otherwise if the business is directly or indirectly a beneficiary of the policy for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt that may be imposed on corporations the death benefit from the policy even though excluded from gross income for normal tax purposes is included in adjusted current earnings for amt purposes in addition although increases to the policys cash surrender value are generally excluded from gross income for normal income tax purposes such increases are included in adjusted current earnings for income tax purposes in recent years congress has adopted new rules relating to corporate owned life insurance any business contemplating the purchase of a new life insurance contract or a change in an existing contract should consult a tax advisor  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th tax treatment of loans  other distributions upon a surrender or lapse of the policy if the amount received plus any outstanding policy debt exceeds the total cost basis in the policy the excess will generally be treated as ordinary income subject to tax regardless of whether a policy is or is not a modified endowment contract however the tax consequences of distributions from and loans taken from or secured by a policy depend on whether the policy is classified as a modified endowment contract cost basis in the policy means  the total of any premium payments or other consideration paid for the policy minus  any withdrawals previously recovered that were not taxable distributions from policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the following tax rules  all distributions including surrenders and partial withdrawals are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the policy value immediately before the distribution over the cost basis in the policy at such time  loans from or secured by the policy are treated as distributions and taxed accordingly if you do not repay loan interest the loan interest itself is treated as a distribution  a  additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution from or loan taken from or secured by the policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan is made on or after the owner attains age   is attributable to the owners becoming disabled or is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the owner and the owners beneficiary distributions from policies not classified as modified endowment contracts are generally treated as first recovering the cost basis in the policy and then only after the return of all such cost basis in the policy as distributing taxable income an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the owner in order for the policy to continue complying with the codes definition of life insurance such a cash distribution will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income to the extent of any gain in the policy loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment contract are not treated as distributions however it is possible that reduced rate loans could be treated as distributions rather than loans distributions including upon surrender and loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment contract are not subject to the  additional income tax rule if a policy which is not now but later becomes a modified endowment contract because of a reduction in benefits then any distributions made from the policy within two years prior to the change will become taxable pursuant to modified endowment contract rules other policy owner tax matters depending on the circumstances the exchange of a policy a policy loan a partial or full surrender a lapse a change in ownership or an assignment of the policy may have federal income tax consequences in addition federal state and local transfer and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of distributions from a policy depends on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary interest paid on policy loans generally is not tax deductible aggregation of modified endowment contracts predeath distributions including a loan partial surrender collateral assignment or full surrender from a policy that is treated as a modified endowment contract may require a special aggregation to determine the amount of income recognized on the policy if we or any of our affiliates issue more than one modified endowment contract to the same policy owner within any month period then for purposes of measuring the income on the policy with respect to a distribution from any of those policies the income for all those policies will be aggregated and attributed to that distribution federal and state estate inheritance and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of proceeds under the policy depend upon your or the beneficiarys individual circumstance diversification requirements investments of the separate account must be adequately diversified for the policy to qualify as a life insurance contract under the code any failure to comply with diversification requirements could subject you to immediate taxation on the incremental increases in policy value plus the cost of insurance protection for the year however we believe the policy complies fully with such requirements owner control the treasury department stated that it anticipates the issuance of regulations or rulings prescribing the circumstances in which your  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th control of the investments of the separate account may cause you rather than us to be treated as the owner of the assets in the separate account to date no such regulations or guidance has been issued if you are considered the owner of the assets of the separate account income and gains from the separate account would be included in your gross income the ownership rights under the policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described by the irs in rulings in which it determined that owners were not owners of separate account assets for example you have additional flexibility in allocating policy premium and policy values these differences could result in you being treated as the owner of a pro rata share of the assets of the separate account in addition we do not know what standards will be set forth in the regulations or rulings which the treasury may issue we therefore reserve the right to modify the policy as necessary to attempt to prevent you from being considered the owner of the assets of the separate account taxadvantaged arrangements the policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuance plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans tax exempt and nonexempt welfare benefit plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement if you are contemplating the use of the policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on its tax consequences you should be sure to consult a qualified tax advisor regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement and the suitability of this policy for the arrangement splitdollar arrangements the irs and the treasury department have issued guidance that substantially affects splitdollar arrangements consult a qualified tax advisor before entering into or paying additional premiums with respect to such arrangements also on july   the sarbanesoxley act of  became law and required significant accounting and corporate governance reform this act prohibits with limited exceptions publiclytraded companies from extending many types of personal loans to their directors or executive officers this prohibition may be interpreted as applying to some arrangements for splitdollar life insurance policies for directors and executive officers of such companies since such insurance may be viewed as involving a loan from the employer for at least some purposes any affected business contemplating the payment of a premium on an existing policy or the purchase of a new policy in connection with a splitdollar life insurance arrangement should consult legal counsel tax shelter regulations prospective owners should consult a tax advisor about the treatment of the policy under the treasury regulations applicable to tax shelters
