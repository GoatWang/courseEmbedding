like most people you dont give another thought to the water that goes down the drain after washing dishes taking a shower or flushing the toilet but if you are one of the many homeowners who rely on a septic tank to dispose of your wastewater it would be smart to give your septic system some attention every so oftenthere are four main parts to your septic systema pipe from your home to the septic tankthe septic tank which is where wastewater sludge and scum accumulatethe drain​ field also known as the leech​ field where wastewater is directed after going through the tanksoil which filters the wastewater and aids in removing bacteria and viruses from itits the homeowners responsibility to make sure all four parts of your septic system are in working order a failed septic system is costly to repair or replace can lead to health hazards in your home and community and may even lower property values in your neighborhooda homeowners responsibilitiesevery homeowner who uses a septic system needs to ensure it stays functional there are three elements to maintaining the systeminspectionspumpingseptic system failure preventioninspecting a septic systeminspections should be at least an annual task some systems may require more frequent inspections a homeowner can perform these inspections on his or her own but hiring a professional is recommended contractors who regularly work with these systems generally have a better idea of what to look for and can better identify problemsto begin locate your septic tank if the entry point is buried and there is no map start by looking at the direction of the outbound pipes in your basement follow the pipes direction into your backyard to locate the tank when you think youre close insert a probe into the soil until you find the piping your inspector should come ready with an insulated probe to useyou should only have to go through this process one time once you find the piping and the tank sketch a map for future use doing so will not only benefit you and future contractors you hire but also the next owner of the homewhen the tank is located you or the contractor will have to dig to uncover the manhole cover to access the tanks interior next test your household water systems to make sure the septic system is working properly flush the toilets turn on the faucets and run any appliances that use water like the dishwasher or washing machine if water drains noticeably slowly there could be an issue in your septic system that needs immediate attentiononce youve determined that the system is in good order its time to measure the sludge and scum levels sludge collects at the bottom of the tank and is comprised of solid wastes scum floats to the top of the tank and is comprised of fats and oils both enter the tank through the inlet tee baffle or the pipe that directs outbound water from the home to the tank on the opposite side of the tank is the outlet tee baffle which directs treated water to a second compartment in the tank for further treatment or to the drain​ field this baffle is the marker to measure scum and sludge againstscum levels should be at least  inches above the bottom of the outlet tee baffle sludge levels should be no more than  foot below the bottom of the baffle if either of these are closer to the bottom of the baffle than they should be its time to have the tank pumpednext take a look at the drain​ field tank walls and pipes any cracks in the walls or pipes need to be addressed right away to prevent septic system failure the drain​ field should not have any odd or foul smells and the grass shouldnt be soggy or full of puddles uncommonly green grass is also a sign that the drain​ field isnt functioning properlypumpingpumping is usually necessary every three to five years but it ultimately depends on the size of the tank the number of people in the household and the types of appliances that are used for example a family of six with a gallon tank might pump every  years but a family of three with the same size tank might pump closer to every four years additionally garbage disposals fill up the septic tank more quickly and result in the need to pump more oftena professional should always pump the tank they will have the right equipment and expertise to know how to safely and effectively remove the sludge and scum from the tank additionally the fumes that are emitted from the tank are noxious and can be dangerous if inhaledalways be present for the pumping process though the contractor will have the right education and experience to do this task properly its important that you oversee the project the maintenance of your septic system is ultimately your responsibility not the contractors when observing the contractors work make surethe contractor uses the correct point of entry  the manhole opening should be used not the inspection portsall scum and sludge is removed  there is no reason to leave any behindseptic system failure preventionwhile inspections are usually an annual task and pumping occurs two or three times per decade prevention is something that must always be kept in mindnever flush or pour chemicals down the drain this includes but is not limited todrain openerspaintshousehold cleaning chemicalsmotor oils and fuelspharmaceuticalscooking oils and greasepesticides and herbicidesintroducing these substances to your septic system can cause damage to the tank or piping and contaminate the groundwater in your areadont flush garbage down the toilet includingdiapersragscleaning clothsdental flosssanitary napkins or tamponscat littercigarettespractice water conservation to prevent flooding your system though your tank can handle many gallons of water too much water at one time can overwork the system and cause solid waste to enter the drain​ field some tips for water conservation includeupgrade to lowflow faucets toilets and showerheadsuse energy​ star appliances that are designed to use less waterdont let the water run excessivelypreventing septic system failure also involves keeping the drain​ field clear never drive or park over the drain​ field and dont allow livestock to walk over it heavy equipment should also be kept away from this areacommon septic system problemsin general a septic system is safe and easy to maintain especially if you regularly inspect and pump it however there may come a time when you run into a problem that needs to be addressed quickly and correctlyclogsclogs or backups are usually caused by improper or tooinfrequent pumping your tank is completely full and solid waste is being forced through the outlet tee baffle and clogging it some signs that you have a clog includewastewater backing up in your drains in your homefoul odors in your homewater draining slowlyto address this problem call a professional to clean out your tank right awaybroken lines or pipesbroken elements of your septic system need to be addressed as soon as they are spotted a number of factors can cause baffles lines and pipes to break or crack includingdigging in the wrong placesulfuric acid or rust deteriorationtreeroot infiltrationusing a special camera a contractor should be able to locate the crack or leak and replace the partto prevent pipe damage call  before you begin any project that would require you to dig a professional can detect which areas you need to stay away from remember there could be more than just your septic system beneath your land  wires and cables may also run through your propertyprevent damage due to tree roots by periodically having a professional take a look at the trees nearby and assess their risk dont attempt to remedy the issue yourself using chemicals like copper sulfate or by cutting down the tree a professional will know how to solve the problem for the long term and should be knowledgeable of any local environmental regulations regarding chemicalshealth hazards associated with septic systemswhen a septic system is working properly and is adequately maintained harmful bacteria will be removed and wont affect the groundwater people living in the home or neighbors however a septic system failure comes with health risks that are best to avoid as much as possibleillnesses caused by failed septic systemsnitrates normally get filtered out before wastewater reaches the drain​ field however if they are still mixed in with the water exiting the septic tank and make their way into drinking water they can lead to an illness that affects infants methemoglobinemia more commonly referred to as blue baby syndrome reduces infants ability to move oxygen through their bloodother diseases that are associated with failed septic systems includetyphoid feverdysenteryhepatitiswater pollution caused by failed septic systemsif your septic system is near a body of water there is a chance that harmful bacteria and viruses from a failed septic system could spread farther than your property using the local waterways nutrients in the wastewater can cause algae to grow much faster than normal blocking necessary sunlight from shining into the water to support other plant and animal life additionally these plants will reduce oxygen levels in the water leaving the environment less habitable for some animal lifetoo much algae and other plant life can also reduce the ability for people to use a body of water for recreational purposes whats more the bacteria and viruses included in the wastewater can also cause disease in the people swimming boating or fishing in the water fish and shellfish can also become contaminated making them harmful to eathow to choose a septic companyyour septic system is highly important to your home and as such its vital to find a good company to help you with maintenance before hiring anyone do some research into the company look online for reviews and testimonials also ask your friends family or colleagues who have septic systems who they work with and whyprogram benefits and costsevery contractor will offer different products and programs even though theyll generally be able to accomplish the same tasks be sure to read the fine print and determine what services the company includes in their different programsthese programs will also vary in cost between different contractors in  septic tank pumping and cleaning cost anywhere from  to  with most
