thank you for joining us on today’s call i will start with a brief review of q results as well as an overall business update our cfo rob gagnon who will provide details on our financial results and our  outlook and after that we look forward to taking your questions during the first quarter we continued to produce solid operation results against a challenging funding environment as a result we are reiterating our  revenue expectations to be flat to slightly down compared to  and adjusted  eps expectations in the range of  to  first quarter revenues were  million down  compared to first quarter  excluding currency translation revenues decreased  or  million additionally included in the organic revenue decline for the quarter there is a decrease in revenue of approximately  which is a result of the ahn disposition in october  excluding the impact of those two items our revenues declined approximately  as a reminder our q results from last year were unseasonably high due to certain factors including the timing of a few large distributor orders in asia in comparison to q of  our business was flat on an organic basis in addition as we discussed and we’ve provided guidance on our last earnings call we were experiencing a slow start to the year but on a positive note we experienced an acceleration in the month of march which has continued into april we are pleased to see more predictability in our business on the topline as well as continued solid leverage to the bottomline net income on a nongaap basis was  million or  per diluted share the benefits of cost containment coupled with gross profit expansion from our site consolidation efforts continue to produce positive results our q gross profit margins were  or  basis points sequential improvement over q of last year the gross profit margin we reported today is the second highest quarter reported in the last two years only outpaced by  we reported in q of  we are making meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives in operational efficiency against this challenging funding environment in the mean time and as i stated on previous calls we will continue to be prudent stewards of capital with a disciplined approach in managing our bottomline until clarity in certainty occur when the certainty to our endcustomers return our commercial teams are positioned to reap the benefits looking at our revenues from a geographic standpoint our us market business is down  in the first quarter while we have not yet realized the full benefit of incremental funding we are continuing to see signs of changing tides with increased funding outlays from the nih to academic labs for the quarter ended march   nih outlays are up almost  compared to the same period in  as has mentioned in the past we believe there is a natural lag between funding of labs and the purchase of consumables and bench top instrumentation while we haven’t reflected it in our guidance we continue to be optimistic that the second half of  will experience a sustained acceleration of academic funding from the nih based on last year’s improved budgets and as of this point bipartisan congressional support for funding increases from the government going forward we remain cautiously optimistic that our customers’ confidence will be restored when funding certainty resumes europe continues to be a soft endmarket due to currency translation and weakness in the funding environment excluding the impact of foreign currency and the impact of ahn disposition our european revenues were down approximately  quarteroverquarter looking ahead in  we expect currency translation to continue to pressure our business results while the macro environment faces these challenges we have taken initiatives to improve our operational performance the biggest impact in the unseasonably high quarteroverquarter comparison was seen in china and the rest of the world where we declined approximately  and  respectively our results in china were impacted by its timing and equipment orders this quarter as compared to last year we are confident this trend will reverse based on visibility into order trends and backlog our team is working extremely hard to drive meaningful growth in this important region and we believe we have a line of sight to achieve yearoveryear growth in china we do believe there have been any significant changes in the business environment in china and we are keenly focused on our execution in the region in terms of the rest of the world we remain well positioned to capitalize on expansion into complementary territories including japan korea and southeast asia in closing we believe we are well positioned to continue to strengthen our operational performance and financial profile while executing our strategy to strengthen our market position and ultimately accelerating topline growth namely our commercial resource allocation is aimed at expanding in complementary territories including japan korea and southeast asia as well as a huge focus on growing product candidates and brands we are unwavering in the strategic vision of our organization and believe it will drive topline growth improved profitability through operational performance and ultimately create shareholder value with that i will turn the discussion over to rob gagnon who will provide more insights into our financials rob robert gagnon okay thanks jeff beginning with the topline revenues in the first quarter were  million a decrease of  million or  compared with revenues of  million for the first quarter of last year excluding the negative impact of the strengthening us dollar revenues in the first quarter would have decreased  or by  million compared with the first quarter of last year and as jeff mentioned included in that decline is the revenue impact from the divestiture of ahn which took place in october  which accounted for approximately  excluding the negative impact of currency translation in ahn the revenue decline is  in the quarter as jeff mentioned our q results from last year were unseasonably high due to certain factors including the timing of a few large distributor orders in asia now turning to cost and expenses cost of revenues in on a nongaap basis were  million for q compared to  million for q of last year as a result our nongaap gross profit was  million this quarter compared with  million for last year’s first quarter gross profit margin was  in q down from  in q of last year this  basis point decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to lower volumes as jeff mentioned however despite revenues being down this quarter our gross profit margin was the second highest quarterly margin we reported in the last two years our nongaap operating expenses for q were  million a decrease of  compared to  million in q of last year and operating income on a nongaap basis in q decreased to  million as compared to  million in q of last year our nongaap operating margin in q was approximately  on a nongaap basis which compares to an operating margin in q of last year of about  on a nongaap basis our nongaap effective tax rate was  in q compared to  in q of last year and the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings in the quarter our nongaap net income in q was  or  per diluted share compared with  per diluted share in q of last year weighted average shares outstanding was  million compared to  million in q of last year i’ll turn to the balance sheet we finished q with approximately  million of cash a decrease of approximately  million compared to  million from q of last year the decrease is timingrelated our accounts receivable were  million compared to  million of those q last year decrease was  and inventories were  million compared to  million at the end of q last year for capital expenditures they were  for both q this year and last year in terms of guidance we expect to spend approximately  million in capex over the course of the year debt at the end of q was  million compared to  million at the end of q last year our available borrowing capacity subject to covenants and working capital restrictions at the end of the quarter was approximately  million and we expect that borrowing capacity to grow throughout the year with earnings expectations i’ll turn to financial guidance today we are reaffirming our full year  guidance which we issued on march  of this year we continue to expect  revenues to be flat to slightly down compared to  revenues on a constant currency basis and excluding the decline in revenues from the sale of ahn and just to clarify flat revenues would be approximately  million excluding foreign currency in ahn as a result of our increased operating leverage and expected modest acceleration of our topline we continue to expect  nongaap earnings per share of  to  or up to a  increase compared to  nongaap diluted earnings per share we will now open the call to questions from participants operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from paul knight from janney montgomery your line is open please go ahead paul knight hi jeff can you talk to the academic market i mean it’s in top – top on the outlook for that and what you see going on with academia right now jeffrey duchemin hey paul yes i think what we saw was a carryover of q into q i think trends are consistent early in the quarter but as i mentioned in my script we actually started to see the trend turn in march and we like what we are seeing right now i think what’s happening is the outlay of funds that has increased since october from the nih we’ve always known that there has been a lag or a delay and i think what we are seeing is is spend actually start to happen for small instrumentation and that’s a good sign so our bookings were up we like the trend that we see going into q we are into q and so i think that’s what happened we start carryover from q things started to pick up in the quarter and we like the position we are in right now for q and i think if you look at q overall we finished right where we thought we finish i think we did a little bit better on the bottomline but in terms of revenues we knew there were going to be some timing delays coming from some distributors in asia and that happened but overall we are pretty confident with where we are and what the outlook for the year is paul knight on the international side are you trying to sign more distributors what can you do to build up the china business and the rest of asia in particular jeffrey duchemin yes i think we are positioned well in china i think in terms of distribution expansion that will come from japan this year and southeast asia i would say our distribution partnerships is solid in china and korea and we are building in japan and southeast asia paul knight so you did a lot of facility consolidations over the prior yearandahalf two years is there any more work do you want to do there on the operating margin side for harvard bioscience jeffrey duchemin i think erp has led to efficiencies operational efficiencies for us and we just completed phase two of our erp initiative with our german facility our multichannel facility that implementation went really well and what i believe it will do is it will provide our ability to become more efficient from an operation standpoint moving forward in terms of site consolidation the heavy lifting is over there is always room for improvement moving forward but i believe we are well positioned in terms of continuing to add to the bottomline through these efficiencies led by erp paul knight and then my last question is this that the nih we can achieve a  growth rate on that budget line what do you harvard bioscience’s organic growth could be jeffrey duchemin well i don’t think we’ve built anything from the nih into our budget so our budget is set right now to flat to a slight decline without anything coming from the nih and once again the outlay of funds has been positive so we feel confident that if this continues it could lead to organic growth for this business but as of today i think we are going to stick with our feeling on a flat guidance for the year paul knight okay thank you jeffrey duchemin thanks paul operator and our next question comes from raymond myers from benchmark your line is open sir raymond myers great thank you jeff maybe you could start by discussing what drove the strong sequential gross margin in the first quarter and discuss were there was any seasonality to this or it just happened to be strong in the first quarter lately jeffrey duchemin well i mean i think if you look at q’s results we – the trend was starting to turn i think the site consolidation in operational improvements that we’ve been working on for a couple of years now are starting to pay off and so that transitioned into q product mix always plays into that but really what’s leading this ray is just the efficiencies of the organization and the heavy lifting that has been completed and we knew the turnaround would happen from a bottomline standpoint really what the organization’s focus right now on is organic growth and we need to get the topline growing that where we are focused we’ve got some great sales and marketing initiatives in place and that will also lead to improved gross margins moving forward robert gagnon and ray hi it’s rob i just wanted to add there is a little bit of timing and there could be mix there we still expect margins to be in the  to  range throughout the course of the year raymond myers but that’s still higher than it was for the balance of last year so is that due to these efficiencies that you was discussing jeff jeffrey duchemin i believe so yes absolutely absolutely raymond myers but okay good as you look across the range of businesses worldwide which product lines are performing relatively better and then what can you do shore up the laggers jeffrey duchemin well i mean you know this business ray there is some product lines that performed really well and are market leaders there is other legacy product lines that are not performing well and what we are focused on right now is accelerating the growth of our top performance our top performing brands our top performing product lines we have some exciting technology and i think i talked a little bit about it last quarter i’ll talk about it again now but how can we accelerate our growth in china how can we accelerate our growth around our btx product lines things like that and what we are doing is we are adding resources we are implementing sales and marketing activities around these growing brands and products for harvard bioscience and they are going to be the leader to turn this business around the lagging products unfortunately sometimes you have to put all your resources into focusing on what’s going to drive the growth of the business and the lagging product lines there is different things we can do with different programs we can run but we are really – at this point in time more focused on the growth drivers for the business and there is several major product categories our electrophysiology product lines our btx product lines that’s where the focus is right now from a sales and marketing standpoint raymond myers okay that’s great i would afford that focus you touched on electrophysiology that’s where i was going next you’ve done a three large – or you made three ep acquisitions they weren’t large but in total they were large about few years ago how are those businesses performing now and what have you learned about your acquisitive strategy visàvis their performance jeffrey duchemin they performed well and we integrated the three companies into harvard bioscience they were three very good acquisitions one of the business units was slightly down last year but what we did was we added some sales capabilities to that business and what we are seeing is the book of business increase already through the end of q this year so the outlook for that business that was down last year is going to be positive this year so now you have three acquisitions that are leading the way for harvard bioscience and back to your last question where we are focused as an organization we are focused on these three acquisitions because they are going to help turn this business around so the electrophysiology business is really the leading product lines and brands that will transform this business moving forward raymond myers okay that sounds good one question i had is has there been any change in the proportion of sales made under direct distribution versus distributorship in this mix of the business jeffrey duchemin that’s a good question i think the resources that we’ve added recently have been more on the direct side last year we did add a channel manager in asia to manage our japanese business but right now the resources that we are discussing internally are more direct than they are for distribution management raymond myers and i presume that’s at higher margin and maybe is that supporting why you are having higher gross margins jeffrey duchemin yes our direct business is a higher margin business for us and obviously that would lead if they are successful in their roles that would lead to increased margin raymond myers okay good good i guess lastly we’ve talked on other calls about the opportunities for further tuckin acquisitions where does that stand and do you still see that as a fund burner item jeffrey duchemin it’s still part of our strategy we still continue to review a pipeline of very interesting companies but we are disciplined in our approach and unfortunately sometimes some of these companies their valuations are a little bit out of line from what we’d be willing to pay but we are active as part of our strategy and we will continue to focus on that moving forward raymond myers okay sounds good i look forward to your next update thank you jeffrey duchemin thanks ray robert gagnon thanks ray operator and our last question comes from lisa springer from singular research your line is open lisa springer thank you hi rob and jeff jeffrey duchemin hi lisa lisa springer my question concerns to markets in japan and korea we’ve talked about the opportunities there could you give us a sense of the scope of those markets and what are the characteristics of those markets jeffrey duchemin well i have more information in korea than i do in japan only because i’ve been to korea i was in korea back in february the korean market is a strong life science market overall it’s been a very good market for us we have excellent distribution partners there our physiology business is strong our molecular business is also very good in korea the japan market though is a market that we just entered last year we have a spectrophotometer market that we are trying to increase in japan and we have a sales – actually a channel manager did a real nice job last year growing that small base of business we expect to see that base of business continue to grow this year but our strategy in japan is to really start to pull some of the other high value products into that market our molecular – overall molecular products our physiology products and electrophysiology products into that market so that’s the goal in japan this year but the korean market is a strong market we have great distribution partners and we believe we will continue to see growth in  lisa springer okay out of those markets compare in size to  say for example of the us market jeffrey duchemin well they are much smaller the asian market as a whole is about  of our total revenue i don’t think we’ve ever broken down each individual country in asia but the us is  of our revenue and the entire asian market is  so much smaller market lisa springer okay and the next thing i wanted to ask you about is just if you could update us on the erp implementation how that’s going globally jeffrey duchemin it’s gone very well as i mentioned couple of minutes ago phase two is complete it actually exceeded our expectations in terms of the team that was put in place to manage and integrate ax into our german facility now we move on to i guess you would call phase three and there is some other german facilities along with some us facilities that we are looking at right now for phase three so there is no timeline on that lisa springer okay okay thank you guys jeffrey duchemin thank you operator we have no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to jeff duchemin for final remarks jeffrey

everyone and thank you for joining us for our q earnings call on today’s call i will start with a brief review of q results as well as an overall business update our cfo rob gagnon will provide details on our financial results and our  outlook and after that we look forward to taking your question s during the second quarter we produced solid business results and continued to execute our strategic objectives second quarter revenues were  million reflecting  organic growth excluding the impact of currency translation and the disposition of ahn we are encouraged by these results and believe we will continue this progress with  to  organic growth expected in the back half of the year as a result we expect  revenue to be flat compared to  which equates to the high end of our previously issued guidance range taking a look at our revenues from a geographic standpoint our us business grew approximately  in the second quarter as i stated on our q call we are beginning to see positive signs of change with increased funding outlays from the nih to academic labs nih outlays are approximately  yeartodate we continue to be optimistic that the second half of  will experience a sustained acceleration of academic funding from the nih while funding outlays don’t immediately translate to increased academic spending we are encouraged by the directional shift and are optimistic that spending will increase with the sustained acceleration of academic funding from the nih although a quarter or two of positive numbers does not yet demonstrate a trend we believe that the us result this quarter is an encouraging indicator that certainty and optimism maybe returning to our endcustomers we are confident that our commercial organization will continue to execute the plan and is well positioned to benefit from these tailwinds we believe our us business is poised for continued topline growth revenues in china increased approximately  in the second quarter as you may remember our q results in china declined due to the impact of timing of instrumentation orders and on our call we indicated that we anticipated a rebound this quarter shows that rebound as well as a continued strong execution by our commercial team overall we continue to be pleased with our performance in china which is one of the fastest growing lab products and service markets globally we are also working with our team to further expand our reach and to capitalize on expansion into complementary territories including japan korea and southeast asia europe continues to be a soft endmarket due to foreign currency headwinds and weakness in the funding environment excluding the impact of foreign currency and the impact of ahn our q european revenues were down approximately  yearoveryear we are focused on improving results in the second half of the year based on a number of initiatives including the launch of two new products in our electrophysiology product portfolio overall we are encouraged to see some acceleration in our business following a slower start to the year and i would like to highlight one of our product lines our btx product line continues to be a growth driver for the company btx which is our legacy electroporation product line is experiencing growth due to its application in the rapidly growing gene editing market as a result of crispr although btx sales makes up approximately  of our consolidated revenues the strong growth we are experiencing is an example of our positioning in a new and exciting innovative life science market in sum we are pleased by our results in the second quarter and encouraged about our prospects for the back half of the year more specifically us revenues grew  during the quarter revenues in china grew almost  and our btx product line continues to make solid gains in addition to these topline highlights gross margins expanded and operating expenses declined in the quarter we remain focused on the strategic vision of our organization and believe that we will continue to drive topline growth improved profitability through operational performance and ultimately create shareholder value with that i will turn the discussion over to rob gagnon who will provide more insight into our financials rob robert gagnon okay thanks jeff beginning with the topline revenues for the second quarter were  million a decrease of  yearoveryear as reported revenues were down  yearoveryear in constant currency second quarter revenues were also impacted by the divestiture of ahn in october  which included approximately  of nonrecurring revenue during the second quarter of  excluding the negative impact of currency translation and ahn revenues on an organic basis grew  in the quarter revenues yeartodate were  million a decrease of  million or  compared with revenues of  million for the six months ended june   revenues on a constant currency basis were  million a decreased of  million or  included in that decline is the revenue impact from the prior year divestiture of ahn which accounted for approximately  million excluding the negative impact of currency translation and ahn revenues are down  yeartodate now turning to costs and expenses cost of revenue on a nongaap basis were  million for q compared to  million for q last year as a result our nongaap gross profit was  million this quarter compared with  million for the second quarter of  gross profit margin was  in q up from  in q of last year this  basis point increase in gross profit margin was partially muted by a few noncash charges at some of our sites related to inventory writedowns during our site consolidations in  we increased levels of safety stock inventory to ensure a smooth transition most of that safety stock inventory has sold through to endcustomers however some surplus inventory has remained on our books namely at our coulbourn subsidiary through that amount we have on hand certain levels of reserve for as part of our own ongoing analysis of inventory excluding this item which amounted to approximately  for the quarter our gross profit margin would have increased over  basis points compared to q of last year and yeartodate our gross profit margin was  essentially flat compared to the same period last year nongaap operating expenses for q were  million a decrease of  compared to  million in q of last year the decrease is due to the realization of continued cost containment measures as well as foreign currency favorability and the disposition of ahn yeartodate nongaap operating expenses were  million a decrease of  million compared to the same period last year operating income on a nongaap basis in q increased to  million as compared to  million in q of last year yeartodate our operating income on a nongaap basis was  million as compared to  million for the same period last year our nongaap operating margin in q was  this compares to an operating margin in q of last year of  and yeartodate our operating margin was  compared to  for the same period of last year our nongaap effective tax rate was approximately  in q compared to  in q of last year the increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of jurisdictional mix of income and to a lesser extent changes in rd tax credits our nongaap net income for q was  or  per diluted share compared with  per diluted share in q of last year and yeartodate our nongaap diluted earnings per share were  compared with  per diluted share in the same period of  before moving on i’d like to highlight one below the line fluctuation that had an impact on our quarterly profitability due to changes in currency exchange rates and the functional currency in which certain working capital balances are recognized we reported a  currency loss in the quarter this compares to a  currency gain in q of last year that swing based on current shares and tax rate impacted our earnings by approximately a penny although we don’t have control over fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are actively reviewing our working capital and the functional currencies in which they are held to identify steps to minimize the impact of future fluctuations weighted average shares outstanding was  million in q as compared to  million in q of last year i will now turn to the balance sheet we finished the quarter with approximately  million of cash accounts receivables were  million as compared to  million as of q last year an increase of  inventory at the end of q was  million compared to  million at the end of q of last year and our capital expenditures were  for q compared to  for q of last year debt at the end of q was  million compared to  million at the end of q last year turning now to our financial outlook we expect to report  to  organic revenue growth for q and q which equates to the high end of our previously issued full year revenue guidance in terms of dollars  to  represents third quarter revenue of  million to  million and fourth quarter revenue of  million to  million on the bottomline we are updating our full year  earnings per share guidance to reflect current expectations including foreign currency rates as well as the negative impact of the noncash inventory charge that we incurred in q as a result we now expect  nongaap earnings per share of  to  from a quarterly standpoint we expect to report  to  in the third quarter and  to  in the fourth quarter we will now open the call to questions from participants operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from william march from janney please go ahead your line is open william march hey guys how are you jeffrey duchemin hey bill robert gagnon hey bill good how are you william march doing well first question jeff you called out the btx product segment this is the first time you are talking about it maybe could you just give us a little more detail on the application and is it for clinical research kind of where who is behind it and then maybe a bigger picture just in terms of your different product segment if you could give us a sense of where you are seeing growth coming from whether it’s cell analysis lab equipment molecular analysis just kind of an underlying growth trend for each of the segments jeffrey duchemin btx is a product family that has been part of harvard bioscience for several years it’s a legacy product and it’s used in gene editing transfections it’s an electroporation device and because of the crispr transfection application that the industry is seeing the increase in gene editing this product has been also increasing with the demand of this type of application it’s one of the faster growing product families that we have in harvard bioscience today one of the things that we’ve done this year is added resources to accelerate that growth over the years – over the last several years we have increased our capabilities in asia and we’ve seen very good results as you saw this quarter with  increase in sales and one of things we’ve done is we’ve added a resource in china for our btx product line so we expect continued growth in this area we will continue to add resources where needed but btx has been a fantastic product for us and we got a great commercial and marketing team executing to our plan this year around this family in regard to some of the other product families we have acquired three companies over the last couple of years in electrophysiology our multi channel systems business triangle biosystems and heka electronik in electrophysiology one of the things that we’ve done is we’ve added resources in the us one of the opportunities for us when we bought multi channel systems was taking advantage of their market presence in europe but lack of market presence here in the us by adding resources and building an electrophysiology sales team we’re actually starting to see positive results come from that it’s taken about a year to get our resources in place and trained and on the ground running but here in the us we saw positive results in the quarter from electrophysiology in our denville business our lab products and supply business we’ve added some new people in that business and we are actually seeing nice turnaround there bookings are increasing we have a new director of operations in our charlotte facility who has done a great job and our sales and marketing teams are putting in new initiatives to help drive the growth of denville so i think that really covers our three basic product families william march got it and then in terms of capital deployment you made a slew of acquisitions a few years ago and in the past couple of years you’ve been taking the cash flow and paying down debt maybe just where are you in terms of strategy on ma and what areas are you looking for to maybe add products to your portfolio jeffrey duchemin yes bill let me take a step back on this question add a little color to it where we were where we are today and where we expect to go so as you remember three or four years ago this was a very fragmented business we had ten plus manufacturing facilities we’ve reduced that in half we had ten plus legacy systems – computer systems with our new erp implementation we’ve cut that in half we had an outdated product portfolio we’ve implemented new product development processes there was a need for geographic expansion in our business we’ve added a sales team in china in seeing the results that we’ve had in china over the last couple of years along with that we faced some challenging headwinds foreign currency devaluations has had an impact on this business ge exited the spectrophotometer business in the funding landscape specifically the nih has been very difficult over the last years but we are seeing a rebound this year with all of that with all of the work that’s been done internally i think we are at a point right now we are actually starting to see the benefits of building this foundation but we knew we had to do this all along we knew it would be difficult we knew we would not be rewarded for it but by building this foundation it’s allowed us now to grow organically and we believe we will continue to see organic growth moving forward and then also it puts us in a great position to start making acquisitions and so that’s where we are today and we feel very positive about the position we are in today and where we are going in the future william march got it and then just one last one rob maybe more so just if you could help walk us through the update for the back half of the year in terms of it seems like the oneoff inventory thing was impact to gross margins kind of how do you see margins playing out in the back half of the year both in terms of gross margin and then operating expenses thanks guys robert gagnon yes thanks bill let me – i want to go back and just repeat some of the guidance that we covered a few minutes ago just to make sure it’s clear to folks on the topline we are expecting  to  organic revenue growth that means for the third quarter  million to  million that’s  to  organic growth for the fourth quarter it would be  million to    million excuse me  million to  million so i want to make sure that that’s clear what the organic numbers are and what that growth would look like on the eps side  to  you are correct revised because of the inventory charges that we took in the second quarter relating to those site consolidations that we initiated back at the end of  into  we wanted to make sure that we had ample safety stock and over shot the market i think on a few of the markets in terms of what that breaks down to on a quarterly basis the fourth quarter always being the – typically being the strongest quarter of the business so it’s going to have higher eps so for the third quarter it’s  to  in the fourth quarter it’s  to  in terms of gross margins so q last year was our lowest quarter in the year we are certainly down sequentially in gross margins but we are still expecting over the long run that gross margins will be in the range of  to  sorry  to  and on operating expenses we were favorable almost  in the quarter  real good result this quarter any time we are below  million i think is good for our business wouldn’t expect that to repeat in the back half of the year but we are certainly seeing good favorability around operating expenses so hope that helps william march yes thanks guys jeffrey duchemin thanks bill operator and our next question comes from raymond myers from benchmark please go ahead raymond myers yes thank you rob let me just clarify what you said you don’t expect the really nice decline in q operating expense to continue in the second half you don’t expect the  sequential decline to repeat again or the rate of  million of operating expense will that return back to a higher rate in the second half robert gagnon no no i wouldn’t expect that to happen again i would expect that this level of  million for the quarter would be a good level in terms of projecting forward for the next couple of quarters probably actually slightly higher than that but in that range of sort of probably  million to  million as an estimate raymond myers okay great that’s excellent cost control congratulations on achieving the positive organic revenue growth that’s a real accomplishment what are the factors that most contributed to that improvement now robert gagnon ray as you know we put a lot of time and effort into many initiatives into our commercial teams globally in all three of our major product categories everything from continuing our geographic expansion and building up our capabilities in asia building electrophysiology sales team here in the us and now more than ever really adding some exciting initiatives and new product launches in europe to help drive and offset the decline we are seeing in europe that’s really where the focus has been over the last couple of years raymond myers okay great let me touch on that you mentioned adding two electrophysiology products in europe can you elaborate on those and what opportunity they create jeffrey duchemin yes the two products there is what we call an me and an mea one is an in vivo the other one is an in vitro system and what this allows us to do is obviously bringing incremental sales revenue for the back half of the year in europe but it also allows us to continue the growth that we’ve seen in the us in the first half of the year and really differentiate ourselves among some of our competitors we are excited about this and one of the great aspects of acquiring a company like multi channel systems was their ability to innovate and develop new products and launch new products and we are starting to see that now not only with our electrophysiology business but throughout the entire company raymond myers that’s great i’ve got an accounting question for rob these inventory charges in the second quarter that affect your full year guidance have you’ve given any thought to excluding them on a nongaap basis or are you just being conservative robert gagnon yes hey ray thanks i am not sure that it’s  yes i would it’s probably some level of conservatism but inventory reserves and writeoffs come up from timetotime certainly not at this magnitude so i think it’s more of a consistency thing we have treated writeoffs in the past this way and so we thought the best thing to do was to be consistent but highlighted for folks that they were aware of what was driving that lower margin and the eps charge raymond myers okay great like the conservatism let me touch again on the pipeline for acquisitions do you have a robust pipeline to identify potential acquisitions and would you still expect to be able to finance these with other cash or low cost debt robert gagnon ray we have a robust portfolio of companies that strategically make a lot of sense for harvard bioscience but at this point in time the focus of this company has been gaining organic growth we will get to a point sometime hopefully in the near future where we will start to acquire companies again but right now i would say the focus of the organization is on organic growth and that’s where we are dedicating our time and resources jeffrey duchemin and ray just in terms of capital available to us to the extent we do execute on tuckin acquisition s we are going to look to cash on the balance sheet as well as that credit facility we have through bank of america which you know is a commercial rate facility   very attractive yields that’s what we would look to in terms of financing those acquisitions raymond myers okay great and thank you and congratulations for restoring the organic growth jeffrey duchemin thanks ray robert gagnon thanks ray operator and your next question comes from lisa springer from singular research please go ahead lisa springer hello rob and jeff i wanted to ask a couple more questions about europe you mentioned new products is something that’s going to help shore up that business could you give us – or first of all are those products available right now or are they going to start selling in europe in the third quarter and secondly could you give us a little bit of a big picture overview of europe what would it take for that market to become attracting how low was the dollar has to go before you would start to see some meaningful sales growth there jeffrey duchemin the new products will be launched this quarter and we are actually taking orders for those new products now so we will generate revenue in q for these new products in regards to get europe to be a growth driver for harvard bioscience i think we need a couple things to happen number one we need currency to stabilize we need the academic investment community to basically see compete with what we are seeing here in the us with the nih and what we are seeing in china i believe that will happen i believe we will see a turnaround in europe the question is timing when that will happen but in the mean time what we are doing is we are installing many different initiatives that weren’t in place in the past to help drive and grow business and offset anything we are seeing in the lack of funding on the academic environment in europe so right now there are many sales marketing initiatives in place for our cell and animal physiology business for our electrophysiology business that we believe will help reduce the decline we’ve seen in europe over the last couple quarters lisa springer okay thank you operator and our next question comes from indiscernible please go ahead unidentified analyst yes it’s indiscernible capital good afternoon gentlemen and it’s a nice quarter congratulations there jeffrey duchemin thank you unidentified analyst could you guys just go over your capex for the back half of the year and just a little more granularity on your – taking your computer systems from ten down to five where are you going to take that what’s the goal there robert gagnon hi matt it’s rob yes so in terms of capex we expect between  million and  million for the year the business requires about  million of maintenance capital and so it’s really that strategic capital that makes up the difference in terms of erp the infrastructure is in place the licenses are acquired they were acquired a few years ago so lot of that spend is behind us there is certainly some cap out on our consulting dollars and service spend as we continue to wrap up the erp program but we are not expecting them to be significant relative to capital and where it’s headed to next couple of years unidentified analyst great thank you very much and good work robert gagnon thanks matt jeffrey duchemin thanks matt operator and our next question comes from jon mccullough from glacier peak please go ahead jon mccullough thanks for taking my call or my question i know you might have dived into this in the past and i have missed it but i know currency has been a headwind but we’ve kind of to the end of june had a pretty good move in the dollareuro or the dollar has weakened should so could we see the headwind either subside or reverse going forward just any clarity there would be helpful robert gagnon yes thanks for the question so in terms of the back half of the year we – currency is no longer a headwind and so as of the end of the quarter june  and for the first couple of weeks of june i would have said if rates stay where they are it’s actually somewhat neutralized in this and there is essentially no impact to the business or very little impact to the business but just over the last week or so the euro has really strengthened from about the  level up to   somewhere around there so it is – still it’s very volatile challenging to predict  is still an awful far cry from  where it was two years ago but certainly if it continues to strengthen would help with our european businesses but difficult to quantify those are long ways to go jon mccullough all right and then it sounds like you guys are again doing great in china i know you mentioned in the last quarter about starting to roll out or get going in japan possibly korea kind of any color there of how it’s going or just jeffrey duchemin yes more japan and i think korea has been a great market for us for many years and we have great distribution partners there but in japan we added a resource last year we are building up our distribution network there things are progressing forward we like what we see and i think there is a bright future for us there so we are still in the beginning stages of building up our business in japan but we are moving forward with it jon mccullough got it and then i know it’s always it’s a wildcard with political environment changing every minute but i guess with the budget nih the whole nine yards which is how you guys are looking at thinking about it going into next year or sort of do you still feel that bipartisan will still kind of protect nih jeffrey duchemin yes i mean we like what we see with the nih yeartodate funding outlays is up  right now there is a proposal for about  billion increase for the  budget so yes i mean things are moving forward with the nih i think this bipartisan’s support there and we like the position we are in moving forward because of that jon mccullough perfect thank you so much guys jeffrey duchemin thanks a lot operator that concludes the question answer session and i will turn the call back over to jeff for final remarks jeffrey duchemin thank you everyone and thanks for your continued support around harvard bioscience we look forward
