heights pa project repair a natural slate roof on two occasions ive needed to call roberts to repair my older slate roof which sits atop a three story home with a steeply pitched angle frank at the main office has consistently been professional kind and responsive the men whove completed the work have been professional efficient and tidy roberts is certainly not a discount roofer so the cost of repairs can initially cause a person to consider second or third opinions however i will never look for those opinions because the cost of the repair and work is fair and deserved and so the question of value for money ends up being moot when one considers how important the roof of ones home is was this review helpful   yes no       review by john a in north versailles pa project repair a tile

acquisition and just prior to an initial  mm capital investment dr began with a guest history study consisting of rfm analysis and geodemographic cluster segmentation while ownership and management believed the guest profile was middle income the psyte cluster segmentation revealed that the guest socioeconomics were substantially higher than perceived the highest income segment in the us indexed  times more likely to pursue this destination while middle income clusters indexed far below average a multivariate analysis was performed utilizing data appended from our behavioral and attitudinal databases to further enhance the target guest profile for group marketing we identified key attributes and performed a discreet choice analysis directed at decision makers at the same time a qualitative study assisted us gaining a thorough knowledge of certain obstacles and pain points within each meeting planner present creative executions were directed to enhance their selfworth and perceived importance with their existing corporate structure the anecdotal perceptions from ownership were local florida and ne corridors were the feeder markets this was consistent with omnibus studies and florida market data however our analysis revealed a more educated younger geographically diverse guest than originally thought it was clear that this destination and client base could already support a rate increase as long as experience supported it and the message increased the perception the brand possessed high consumer loyalty indicated by returning guests and bounce back

sorry you dont have any testimonials posted yet about data driven data speaks volumes if you know what to listen fordata is coming at us from every direction everyone seems to be collecting it analyzing it profiting from it and talking about it whether we’re talking about web analytics or consumer purchase history demographic psychographic or behavioral data it’s all out there for the taking but determining what to do with it is what counts that’s where we step in unlocking the core truths of relevant data we will develop a clear actionable plan to achieve your objectives creatively fueled turning data into desire utilizing data is one thing converting it into prospects customers brand advocates brand value and revenue is quite another we combine the power of data with creativity to deliver rich engaging brand experiences by harnessing and embracing this combination we can develop storytelling that is meaningful to your audience in essence turning data into desire capabilities research analytics strategy brand planning creative digital media planningbuying social influence photography research it’s the foundation of everything we do whether it’s to determine the prioritized attributes of a specific market segment in a decision making process the emotional effects of a brand on a consumers’ psyche statistically driven multivariate analysis to yield certainty levels in excess of  or simply the analysis of all existing literature and information globally available and competitive analysis — it’s the initial stage in truly predictive decision making analytics marketing decisions should be founded in analytics and have a measurable outcome yet decision making as a science is far from the norm marketing strategies are still widely developed instinctively as though they are something intuitively divined even marketing research driven decisions are often based on questionable methodologies and made with less than acceptable levels of confidence with daniel  roberts every decision or recommendation is based on verifiable statistical research we don’t divine or intuit anything we remove the words “assume” and “believe” from your vocabulary we actually make predictive analytics happen strategy whether the objective is generating sales building brands or changing social behavior we start with a substructure of understanding who the customers is not just a segmentation study but our proprietary segmentation study your marketing strategy utilizes those segments along with our available  databases consisting of behavioral attitudinal and dedicated media consumption statistics we then develop an approach that is statistically valid easy to communicate and makes sense brand planning successful brands know what they stand for and have an understanding of where they fit into the culture at large it’s no longer just about making a good product and the sales will follow this is especially true in a social media landscape that is dynamic and fluid consumers expect companies to make good products but they expect more social responsibility corporate citizenship and relevance we can help you be a part of the conversation of consumers by creating brand platforms that create bonds between you and your customers and those are the bonds that build business creative writers artists technologists editors and thinkers all come together here sometimes their ideas are big and bold sometimes they are subtle and nimble but they must always be inspired making something relevant fun joyful and emotional is the job of the creative these folks are a little different they think differently and look at the world in unique ways but then again what epic idea ever came from looking at things the same old way digital computers smartphones tablets smart tvs and of course wearable technologies the digital world has opened up unprecedented new ways to reach out and connect with your clients and customers with our
