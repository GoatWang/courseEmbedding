administration gemifloxacin a compound related to the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics is available as the mesylate salt in the sesquihydrate form chemically gemifloxacin is rszaminomethylmethoxyiminopyrrolidinylcyclopropylfluorodihydrooxonaphthyridinecarboxylic acid the mesylate salt is a white to light brown solid with a molecular weight of  gemifloxacin is considered freely soluble at neutral ph  μgml at ºc ph  its empirical formula is c h fn o •ch o s and its chemical structure is click image for fullsize original each white to offwhite oval filmcoated factive tablet has breaklines and ge  debossed on both faces and contains gemifloxacin mesylate equivalent to  mg gemifloxacin the inactive ingredients are crospovidone hydroxypropyl methylcellulose magnesium stearate microcrystalline cellulose polyethylene glycol povidone and titanium dioxide clinical pharmacology pharmacokinetics the pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin are approximately linear over the dose range from  mg to  mg there was minimal accumulation of gemifloxacin following multiple oral doses up to  mg a day for  days mean accumulation  following repeat oral administration of  mg gemifloxacin once daily steadystate is achieved by the third day of dosing absorption and bioavailability gemifloxacin given as an oral tablet is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract peak plasma concentrations of gemifloxacin were observed between  and  hours following oral tablet administration and the absolute bioavailability of the  mg tablet averaged approximately   ci  following repeat oral doses of  mg to healthy subjects the mean ± sd maximal gemifloxacin plasma concentrations cmax and systemic drug exposure auc  were  ±  μgml range  μgml and  ±  μg•hrml range  μg•hrml respectively in patients with respiratory and urinary tract infections n similar estimates of systemic drug exposure were determined using a population pharmacokinetics analysis geometric mean auc   μg•hrml range  –  μg•hrml the pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin were not significantly altered when a  mg dose was administered with a highfat meal therefore factive tablets may be administered without regard to meals distribution in vitro binding of gemifloxacin to plasma proteins in healthy subjects is approximately  to  and is concentration independent after repeated doses the in vivo plasma protein binding in healthy elderly and young subjects ranged from  to  and was unaffected by age renal impairment does not significantly affect the protein binding of gemifloxacin the bloodtoplasma concentration ratio of gemifloxacin was  the geometric mean for vdssf is  lkg range  –  lkg gemifloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body after oral administration concentrations of gemifloxacin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid exceed those in the plasma gemifloxacin penetrates well into lung tissue and fluids after five daily doses of  mg gemifloxacin concentrations in plasma bronchoalveolar macrophages epithelial lining fluid and bronchial mucosa at approximately  hours were as in table  table  gemifloxacin concentrations in plasma and tissues  mg oral dosing tissue concentration mean ± sd ratio compared with plasmamean ± sd plasma   μgml — bronchoalveolar macrophages   μgg   epithelial lining fluid   μgml   bronchial mucosa   μgg   metabolism gemifloxacin is metabolized to a limited extent by the liver the unchanged compound is the predominant drugrelated component detected in plasma approximately  up to  hours after dosing all metabolites formed are minor  of the administered oral dose the principal ones are nacetyl gemifloxacin the eisomer of gemifloxacin and the carbamyl glucuronide of gemifloxacin cytochrome p enzymes do not play an important role in gemifloxacin metabolism and the metabolic activity of these enzymes is not significantly inhibited by gemifloxacin excretion gemifloxacin and its metabolites are excreted via dual routes of excretion following oral administration of gemifloxacin to healthy subjects a mean ± sd of  ±  of the dose was excreted in the feces and  ±  in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites the mean ± sd renal clearance following repeat doses of  mg was approximately  ±  lhr range  lhr which indicates active secretion is involved in the renal excretion of gemifloxacin the mean ± sd plasma elimination halflife at steady state following  mg to healthy subjects was approximately  ±  hours range  hours special populations pediatric the pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin in pediatric subjects have not been studied geriatric in adult subjects the pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin are not affected by age gender there are no significant differences between gemifloxacin pharmacokinetics in males and females when differences in body weight are taken into account population pharmacokinetic studies indicated that following administration of  mg gemifloxacin auc values were approximately  higher in healthy female patients compared to males males and females had mean auc values of  μg•hrml range  –  μg•hrml and  μg•hrml range  –  μg•hrml respectively no gemifloxacin dosage adjustment based on gender is necessary hepatic insufficiency the pharmacokinetics following a single  mg dose of gemifloxacin were studied in patients with mild childpugh class a to moderate childpugh class b liver disease there was a mean increase in auc inf of  and a mean increase in cmax of  in these patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers the pharmacokinetics of a single  mg dose of gemifloxacin were also studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment childpugh class c there was a mean increase in auc inf of  and a mean increase in cmax of  in these subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers these average pharmacokinetic increases are not considered to be clinically significant there was no significant change in plasma elimination halflife in the mild moderate or severe hepatic impairment patients no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild childpugh class a moderate childpugh class b or severe childpugh class c hepatic impairment see dosage and administration  renal insufficiency results from population pharmacokinetic and clinical pharmacology studies with repeated  mg doses indicate the clearance of gemifloxacin is reduced and the plasma elimination is prolonged leading to an average increase in auc values of approximately  in patients with renal insufficiency in the pharmacokinetic studies gemifloxacin cmax was not significantly altered in subjects with renal insufficiency dose adjustment in patients with creatinine clearance  mlmin is not required modification of the dosage is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ mlmin see dosage and administration  hemodialysis removes approximately  to  of an oral dose of gemifloxacin from plasma photosensitivity potential in a study of the skin response to ultraviolet and visible radiation conducted in  healthy volunteers the minimum erythematous dose med was assessed following administration of either gemifloxacin  mg once daily gemifloxacin  mg once daily ciprofloxacin  mg bid or placebo for  days at  of the  wavelengths tested  nm the photosensitivity potential of gemifloxacin was not statistically different from placebo at  nm uva region gemifloxacin showed a photosensitivity potential similar to that of ciprofloxacin  mg bid and the photosensitivity potential for both drugs were statistically greater than that of placebo photosensitivity reactions were reported rarely in clinical trials with gemifloxacin  see adverse reactions it is difficult to ascribe relative photosensitivityphototoxicity among various fluoroquinolones during actual patient use because other factors play a role in determining a subject’s susceptibility to this adverse event such as a patient’s skin pigmentation frequency and duration of sun and artificial ultraviolet light uv exposure wearing of sun screen and protective clothing the use of other concomitant drugs and the dosage and duration of fluoroquinolone therapy see adverse reactions and adverse reactions postmarketing adverse reactions  drugdrug interactions antacidsdi and trivalent cations the systemic availability of gemifloxacin is significantly reduced when an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid is concomitantly administered auc decreased  cmax decreased  administration of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid or ferrous sulfate  mg at

multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations or videx® didanosine chewablebuffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within  hours before or  hours after taking factive tablets calcium carbonate  mg given either  hr before or  hr after gemifloxacin administration showed no notable reduction in gemifloxacin systemic availability calcium carbonate administered simultaneously with gemifloxacin resulted in a small not clinically significant decrease in gemifloxacin exposure auc inf decreased  and cmax decreased sucralfate when sucralfate  g was administered  hours prior to gemifloxacin the oral bioavailability of gemifloxacin was significantly reduced  decrease in auc  decrease in cmax when sucralfate  g was administered  hours after gemifloxacin the oral bioavailability of gemifloxacin was not significantly affected therefore factive should be taken at least  hours before sucralfate see precautions in vitro metabolism results of in vitro inhibition studies indicate that hepatic cytochrome p cyp enzymes do not play an important role in gemifloxacin metabolism therefore gemifloxacin should not cause significant in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are metabolized by cyp enzymes theophylline gemifloxacin  mg at steadystate did not affect the repeat dose pharmacokinetics of theophylline  to
