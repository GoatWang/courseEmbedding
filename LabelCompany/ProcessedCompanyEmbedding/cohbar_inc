drug candidates cb and cb have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in preclinical models for the treatment of obesity with additional confirmatory studies planned to determine therapeutic potential for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash and as a potential addon to other drugs for the treatment of type  diabetes “we see this milestone as an important step in demonstrating the enormous potential of mitochondria based therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic disorders underlying agerelated diseases our extensive preclinical studies with our internally developed motsc analogs continue to validate their novel mechanisms of action for metabolic regulation and protection” said simon allen cohbar’s ceo “our mbt studies demonstrated significantly greater weight loss together with more selective reduction of fat mass versus lean mass in headtohead comparison to a marketleading obesity drug we also observed improvements in triglyceride levels with mbt treatment as well as favorable effects on liver enzyme markers associated with fatty liver disease and nash” motsc belongs to a novel class of peptides derived from the mitochondrial genome until recently scientists believed the mitochondrial genome contained only  genes and as a result it had been relatively unexplored as a focus of drug discovery efforts research by cohbar founders and their academic collaborators revealed that the mitochondrial genome has dozens of potential new genes that encode peptides  in preclinical models of agerelated diseases a number of these peptides have shown potential diseasemodifying effects including metabolic neuroprotective cytoprotective and antiinflammatory effects cohbar’s efforts are focused on developing motsc and its expanding portfolio of mitochondrialderived peptides into mitochondria based therapeutics mbts cohbar is initiating indenabling activities and confirmatory studies for both of these firstinclass motsc analog drug candidates
