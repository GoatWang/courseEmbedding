investment outlook the long cycle continues we expect the long postcrisis economic recovery to continue in  as a base case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the growth cycle to continue in

declines are an inevitable part of investing these  investment strategies can help you ride out the bumps and keep your eyes on the big picture stay calm and get professional advice avoid making quick moves on your own as tempting as it may be instead meet with your financial professional and share your concerns resist making decisions on the basis of single events reexamine your investment goals time horizon and risk tolerance with your financial professional to make sure they remain appropriate maintain a diversified investment portfolio work with your financial professional to spread your risks consider selecting a mix of mutual funds that invests in stocks and bonds additionally keeping an appropriate amount of your portfolio in money market or cash equivalent mutual funds and other liquid investments can help you meet shortterm needs include funds that invest outside the united states nonus markets often move in their own market cycles diversification doesn’t guarantee a profit but over time it can help to reduce the effects of volatility maintain a diversified investment portfolio invest regularly — in good and bad times avoid moving everything into stocks at the hint of good news — or everything into cash following bad news instead of fearing a down market view it as an opportunity to buy shares at potentially lower prices consider investing a fixed amount every month or quarter a strategy known as dollar cost averaging you won’t have to guess which way the market is going you also wont risk the possibility of investing all of your money at the top of the market please note that this strategy of regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss invest regularly — in good and bad times invest regularly — in good and bad times invest for income consider mutual funds that stress the role of dividends — or bond funds that produce a steady stream of interest payments incomeproducing investments can provide a cushion during a down stock market after all a dividend is yours whether the stock price is rising or falling invest for income avoid jumping in and out of the market successful market timing during a bear market is extremely difficult because it requires two nearperfect actions getting out at the right time and getting back in at the right time as a result investors typically end up buying high and selling low one reason it’s difficult a bear market is not usually characterized by a straightline decline in stock prices instead it tends to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases and then declines that bring with them corresponding feelings of euphoria and concern other resources investment insights market commentary staying the course investments are not fdicinsured nor are they deposits of or guaranteed
