naples florida in the united states the firm was founded by robert g moses who is also the portfolio manager and general partner the company manages two us equity funds  the rgm value opportunity fund lp us million and the rgm value opportunity fund ii lp us million  with total assets under management of us million both of these funds are absolutereturn oriented and aim to exploit valuation extremes in the marketplace the rgm value opportunity fund lp has returned  since inception june  with an annualised return of  and annualised volatility of  the rgm value opportunity fund ii lp has returned  since inception september  with an annualised return of  and annualised volatility of  with so many funds available in the market what makes your fund different from the others whats your definable edge in terms of strategy and market ability we think our fund is different in a number of ways first and foremost we invest in businesses we do not speculate on stocks while we invest entirely in publicly traded companies our investment philosophy is more private equitylike than many traditional hedge funds or mutual funds with this privateequity mentality we manage a very concentrated portfolio  positions of companies that we have researched intensively  this too is different from many funds that have significantly more diversified portfolios we invest in highconviction ideas and build large positions in companies both as a  of our portfolio and as a  of their shares outstanding admittedly a concentrated portfolio can lead to more volatile returns but we believe that volatility often creates opportunity our investment discipline is focused on finding businesses that we feel are trading at  of their intrinsic value based on our analysis of their financial and qualitative attributes we spend a lot of time on corporate governance and adhere to what we term as valueadded activism by partnering with portfolio company management teams to enact change if we believe certain actions are necessary to realise intrinsic value in a business for example we will typically not invest in a great business with a bad management with the goal of enacting a management change through proxy battles or challenging letters rather we focus on businesses where we feel we can work with management by sharing ideas such as our view on capital structurecapital allocation decisions value creation through share repurchase programmes etc ultimately we hold management teams accountable to creating shareholder value and will not let them off the hook to do so  but over much longer and more strategic increments than quarterly earnings tax efficiency is also an important focus for us given the longterm investment horizon  years with which we expect to hold our positions we expect to be more tax efficient than many funds as we would expect most of our gains to either be longterm or unrealised in any given year ultimately aftertax returns are really what matter we believe that our edge lies in our concentrated approach and our independence we believe managing a concentrated portfolio is the best way to preserve capital and achieve superior returns over the long term concentration allows us to be highly selective about our investments perform the type of indepth research we think is necessary in order to truly understand a business and its management teams motivations as well as the ability and time to partner closely with those management teams and hold them accountable to creating shareholder value lastly we pride ourselves on our independence from the broader investment community which emboldens us to be true contrarians we consider ourselves both geographically and behaviourally removed from wall street and understand the vital importance of conviction and patience to being a successful value investor   what about the personal and business histories of the team members is there any positive performance track record

recently ben was employed as a trader and analyst at john henry  company   is there any reason to have two funds especially when your investment mandate strategy and base currency are exactly the same for both of them we currently have  funds the rgm value opportunity fund which is a c fund and the rgm value opportunity fund ii which is a c fund as we manage both high net worth and institutional money we have two funds because of the legal and structural issues associated with c and c classification therefore limited partners in the c fund are generally high net worth individuals while the majority of limited partners in the c fund are institutions   you tend to focus on healthcare technology business services industrials and consumer products etc with only one research analyst on your team how strong is your inhouse research do you rely on other independent sources too we acknowledge that we are fishing in a pretty large pond when we say our focus is on industrials healthcare technology and consumerrelated businesses but we tend to focus predominantly on market caps of us million to us billion so the universe of companies we look at is more targeted than one may initially believe in addition because we run a concentrated portfolio of  positions we do not need a stock of the day or for that matter a stock of the week we can be extremely selective about what goes into our portfolio and ultimately we would rather know an enormous amount about a few companies and industries than know a little about a lot of companies and industries with this type of approach we think that our research effort is appropriately staffed admittedly though our idea generation still involves a lot of heavy lifting so it is worth talking about it in some detail… most importantly we have very few contacts in the buyside community and therefore do not consider ourselves in the flow of the ideasharing networks that many hedge funds use ie instant messaging idea dinners etc in addition we do not use wall street research we think that level of independence is an edge  it allows us to be true contrarians by filtering out the noise or buzz in certain ideas while avoiding group think at any given time we may be looking at  companies for potential investment and usually end up selecting one or maybe two for the portfolio after several months of research the challenge we face is finding those original  ideas there are quantitative and qualitative elements that going into finding our ideas we like to find businesses that would not show up on traditional value investor screens because the companys valuation based on recent results may not tell the whole story for example a company may have a money losing segment that is masking their income statement where if they sold the segment or shut it down the true earnings power of the company would be revealed or perhaps it is something as simple as seeing insiders buying stock in their own company we tend to focus on companies in the marketcap range of us million to us billion for a number of reasons first because of their size many of these companies are orphaned by the sellside and therefore have very little if any analyst coverage this means there is probably less understanding about the value creation potential of the companies we research second we like the microsmallcap segment because of the potential for privatisation or acquisition sarbanesoxley and the overall costs of being a public company in the us are much more of a burden for small businesses than for large businesses going private to eliminate those costs or selling out to financial or strategic buyers are trends that we think will continue for small public companies and are very viable alternatives for value creation while on the topic of consolidation it is worth noting that the industries we follow have historically been areas where there is a lot of ma therefore researching and understanding the reasons certain companies are acquired and the reasons the buyers pay what they do is relevant it is a good starting point for identifying which companies in an industry are still independent what they might be worth to an acquirer and if they are a suitable investment opportunity for us ultimately there are qualitative and quantitative elements that go into our sourcing ideas and the vast majority of the time our research process results in us not making an investment   do you do company visits company visits are generally a prerequisite for our building a position in a company we can glean a lot from talking to management on the phone as well as to their competitors suppliers clients etc but until you spend time with a management facetoface and see how they react to difficult questions as well as see their corporate headquarters to get a feel for the culture you dont really know a company and what is motivating management the time that we spend on a companys turf is invaluable   rgm funds have witnessed a lot of volatility since inception most of which is bad downside deviation this has put the sharpe ratio in the range of  for both the funds with such high volatility how do you think rgm capital could be made sustainable and scalable at the same time going forward unlike most funds today we do not manage ours to mitigate volatility to some that is nonsensical in todays environment where low volatility returns are one of the keys to winning large institutional mandates but as a value investor with a longterm approach to our investments downward volatility creates opportunity to add to positions at cheaper valuations  and that is exactly what we have done during every drawdown that we have been through in addition we will not stoploss ourselves out of a position from a value investor standpoint that is counterintuitive  why sell a stock that is getting cheaper when you have an enormous amount of conviction in the research you have done on it ultimately we firmly believe in and practice the adage that we would rather have a lumpy  return than a smooth  return that philosophy was coined by one of the greatest investors of the modern era  warren buffet  but it does not appeal to everyone with respect to our overall performance since inception there are a few things worth noting first our typical holding period for an investment is  years as we have been in operation for a little over  years we feel we are still in the earlymiddle stages of our overall portfolio reaching fair value we buy businesses that are significantly undervalued because other investors have given up on them and sold their stock down to very compelling levels from a riskreward standpoint  or we buy businesses that are in some sort of transition that at some point in the future will reveal their true value under both scenarios it takes time for the market to recognise and reward these companies with higher valuations we are very willing to play that waiting game with the companies in our portfolio  most of which we have held since starting our funds in addition because of our research process we were very methodical about investing up our initial capital therefore we did not become what we consider to be fully invested ie  of capital until june  accordingly our returns in the second half of  and the first half of  were diluted by our high cash balance our unaudited compound gross return on invested capital since inception works out to  for rgm i and  for rgm ii which hopefully give additional credence to our stock picking capabilities we believe our philosophy and business are highly scalable with a concentrated portfolio we do not need an army of research analysts and there are more than enough stocks in the industries and market cap ranges that we tend to focus on moreover it is easier to manage a business from a budgetingoverhead perspective in naples fl than it is in a major city our breakeven point is much lower than it is for most funds that reside in higher cost centres lastly i suspect your reference to scale infers asset growth with the strategy we employ we know we need to be very smart about the types of limited partners we admit to the fund and their appetite for volatility as well as their own track record of dealing with it understanding things such as their track recordbehaviour of dealing with managers during a drawdown how long have they been invested in strategies like ours and asking for a list of managers they are invested with as potential references are all critically important to building out the correct limited partnership base given we focus predominantly on smallcap names which we think is very fertile territory given our style of investing and valueadded activist approach we fully recognise that there is a limit to the amount of assets we can manage before we would need to start investing in larger companies that threshold amount is much larger than where we are today in aum but growing correctly to get to that level is what is most important   what is your focus on risk management our risk management tends to be more qualitative than quantitative and we believe it is ultimately derived from the types of companies we invest in they tend to be very high quality businesses with defendable market niches so the risk of a competitor blindsiding them with a new technology or an ability to under price them is somewhat limited in addition we tend to invest only in companies that have limited debt or more often net cash on their balance sheet and are generating consistent free cash flow with all our investments we seek to quantify downside protection which we would define as a level where a companys valuation is unsustainably low cash on the balance sheet or a large installed base that generates a recurring royalty stream that we can apply a net present value to can give us the downside protection we look for in our investments certainly some companies with those attributes have traded below net cash  this occurred in q  for example  but those types of valuations tend to be unsustainable and often represent the best opportunities for significant returns on investment in addition we enter every idea with a belief that there are multiple ways to make money on the investment ether management will fix their business and realise value or they will make some sort of transformation to unlock value ie shutting down or selling a lossmaking business or a competitor will unlock the value themselves by acquiring the company ultimately we believe the best risk management is our research truly understanding a business both on a standalone basis as well as in the context of its industry can be a very effective risk management tool but also knowing what drives a companys management team and its board is vitally important is management simply working for what we might consider an overlyindulgent salary are they flush with options and therefore more apt to take risks that might not be in the interests of shareholders in an effort to grow their company are they empire builders when was the last time they bought stock in the open market these are questions that we attempt to answer before buying share one of a company   how much capital do you intend to raise this year is their any predefined plan we currently manage just under us million and we certainly want to increase our assets under management before doing a soft close but that goal is driven largely by our desire to increase our positions in certain of our portfolio companies and becoming more influential shareholders to them thus far we have filed one d as a  shareholder in one of our companys with additional capital and larger position sizes as a  of a companys shares outstanding we would absolutely expect to make additional public filings and feel that is a very effective mechanism for raising our profile with management making our views known and holding them accountable to making decisions that are in the interest of shareholders that is not to say that ds are the only mechanism for creating value in fact most of the situations we have been involved in since inception of the funds where value has been created have been without public filings but it is another tool that plays into our belief of having multiple scenarios from which we can make money on an investment it is worth noting that we do not have any misperceptions about the capital raising market  given our concentrated approach and the inherent volatility that goes along with it the number of investors that have an appetite for what we do is a small subset of the community that invests in alternative assets we therefore try to be as smart and as targeted as possible about talking to potential investors by understanding their track record of investing in concentrated managers and their stomach for it it is very refreshing when we find them because we find we talk the same language  cash flow yields aftertax returns corporate governance etc   finally what are your views on the north american markets for the rest of the year we try to steer clear of making market calls largely because  our portfolio companies tend to beat to their own drums regardless of market conditions and  our prognostication will invariably prove wrong  no one really knows that said the valuation of the overall market looks reasonable to us the sp  currently trades at about x forward earnings or a  earnings yield that is not bad considering the us year treasury bond yield is below  given our focus on free cash flow earnings yields are less relevant historically we would have argued that for the majority of companies gaap earnings were overstating the true free cash flow of the entities due to under depreciated assets unrecognised options expense and pension accounting we would argue however that the spread between gaap earnings yields and fcf yields have narrowed a bit as phantom pension income courtesy of the bull market of the late s and overzealous pension return assumptions made by management has switched to pension expense on the income statements of many companies also corporate capital spending has been subdued over the last several years that has resulted in many companies with lower capital expenditures than book depreciation and amortisation and while no one has figured out a perfect approach to account for options expense there has been a concerted effort to at least realise it is a big cost that needs to be addressed we are not saying that companies are now understating earnings but at a minimum earnings are perhaps a better proxy for free cash flow than they have been in the recent past importantly we believe there is always value to be found regardless of the broader market levels traditional value stocks industrials conglomerates etc were very cheap during the tech bubble at the end of the decade few investors wanted to talk about slow growth cash generative businesses at that point in late  there were a lot of busted technology companies that were interesting as many traded below net working capital and often below net cash the investors that couldnt own enough of these companies in  couldnt get out fast enough three years later currently we are finding very interesting companies that have often been viewed as growth businesses for example we are currently invested in several software companies software is interesting to us for several reasons first many software companies have large installed bases and significant customer mind share which makes it very difficult for customers to rip them out of there workflow and therefore allows software companies to extract profitable maintenance dollars second there is a lot of ma activity in the software industry financial buyers are sniffing around attempting to latch on to consistent maintenance revenue streams while strategic buyers are looking for growth lastly and most important we have found several software companies that are trading at  free cash flow yields it is very intriguing when you can get a doubledigit cash yield on a
