resident that lives there at the complex about resident apartment  we have married husband and wife and family that leaves there that respects there private and the resident that lives in  is disrespecting the married husband and guy and saying if she had a chances she would take you really quick and flirting a certain way and saying hi that what my husband says or the rest of resident and saying hi and be flirting with them and bieng a certain way to say hi to the guys that are married and maintenance guys and saying that the maintenance guys that are friends yes we have a maintenance guys are there to there job not to friends or flirting with them the residents are also noticing when she say hi in a flirting way to the maintenance guys or to other guys too when she walks her dog or washing her clothes we are all married and the ladies dont have time to be firting with any guys we all respects are guys or husbands if resident  if she is married or has a boyfriend respect that noticed she has rings on her finger and telling all guys her family problems or telling the ladies that live there about her health issues or family problems its none of there business and sometimes also my husband and the rest of residence married guys are noticing what she is wearing she wearing white jogging shorts and the guys can see her something underneath very disrecting on the complex we all dont need drama or any problems here also i have all ready notified law enforcement sapd about this matter thanks sincerely mrs tovarsaddlewood apartmentsblueoak ratedthe  review sums it up but with these additions the new owners are actively fixing up their property they seem to care about it it was neglected dangerous before lynd came along the managers we havent needed their help so cant comment on whether theyre responsive or helpful i would hope that they spell out what are the policies here and enforce them cause some of these folks are despicable unsupervised kids are one of the biggest problems kids between  and  years old wild and will challenge you if you dare say something about them throwing rocks or running in the parking lots theyre constantly messing around other peoples cars we have cracked windows from them throwing rocks at windows and cars and each other wish theyd get rid of the landscape rocks i think wed be in a much better place if the parents were compelled to get out of bed and watch their children unless one of them comes up dead or hurt nothing will change besides the dope heads kids left to their own devises will bring a place down quicker than anything all of this can be placed at the lap of absentee parents who need to stop pawning their kids off on the community and take responsibility i recommend renting here to others with the current owners they have much to do to bring this long neglected place around but theyre trying and doing a great job hill country villasalwaysexpectquality ratedthis complex is average if ythis complex is average if you are looking for security upgraded fixtures and quality amenities than you have the wrong place there have been  break ins reported they have to report all crime in the complex to the residents but they do nothing to make the complex more secure there seems to be a large amount of dog owners so there is always feces on the sidewalks dont let the gated community fool you they have one gate code and once you give it out that person can enter anytime they choose to before you sign a lease physically go check your apartment i was issued the wrong floor plan and told i had to wait a month and a half before the one i originally requested became available the leasing agent tried arguing with me and told me that i never asked for a specific floor plan when we had a  minute conversation about it over the phone due to time and  constraints i had to take what was available the parking is also horrible especially after pm most of the parking slots have been converted to carports which you have to pay  a month for for the amount they charge in rent they need to upgrade their amenities and provide better security westgate apartmentsjj j ratedsomewhat noisyapartment walls are very thin so you can hear the neighbors fight in the early morning next property over and listen to their barking dog at am any given night the property ownermanager is nice but the work they do in the apartments is left halfdone and the workmanship is shoddy in addition there have been few hot showers since moving in and the heat wasnt turned on in time for the cold snap that everyone in san antonio talked about for a week prior to it turning cold that left us without heat in  degree weather not pleasant especially since you couldnt take a hot shower to warm upthis place has good qualitiesits cute the grounds are in nice condition and in an up and coming neighborhood only a half mile from the pearl but it needs professional management help theres no one manning the office and keeping track of issuesabsolutely no followup or tenant contact from management even when its promised i dont think this is intentional the managerowner in charge cant do it all and they absolutely need to hire help for the price were not terribly impressedand wont be signing another lease when ours is uppolo club apartmentskimberly t ratedi dont know what apartment myownhero is referring to but that does not describe the polo club i am a mother with two young children i live in the  and i have not had roaches nor cracks in the wall my apartment was immaculate when i moved in and it stays that way because i clean my home if you had roaches you were filthy because these apartments have pest control come twice a month and as far as work orders my microwave went out on a friday they told me that they might not make it in til saturday but were able to replace my microwave that same friday anyways yes the gate is sometimes opened but dont single out polo club just because you saw someone jump a fence that sounds like a lie anyways if you see the gates you cant jump them the apartment is not falling a part they are pretty new sounds like your on a mission to slander a complex for your own benefitwhere do you work westpond i moved from there and that is bad management you might be confused with another polo club apartment complex but not san antonios brandon oaks apartmentsjay c ratedthe worst mistake i have ever made was signing a second year contract with these apartment complexes in the  months that i have lived here there have been three different managers and countless different realtors that alone should be a warning sign their staff never seems to know what theyre doing because theyre mainly always changing the people they can be nice when they want to but they have also been extremely rude as well and i don’t know about you but i prefer to not have bipolar staff members to deal with communication is one of their worst suits i would never recommend these apartments to anybody pay the extra rent for the apartments across the street its worth it because in this case you definitely get what you pay for the only reason i didnt put  star is because i know there are worse apartments out there the park at presa apartmentselida g ratedhalfhalf i live pressa apartment from  my only problem for me to move out it was because to far from my work never had a problem with the management or staff when i needed something fix it was done immediately the pool was always clean and the entire complex and afordable rent the worst of my stay   no notice when turn off water because of construction i understand fixing up the complex few times went late to work laundry room few times put money did not work to long or to slow the remodeling to many cars over night especialy on weekends difficult to park at night the office need to provide stickers and enforce a  penalty i did like all of the events for the residentsthanks cindy and staff city base vista apartmentsjulie s ratedi have one child and picking a safe place is crucial ive lived here for four years and love it they have beautiful grounds they make sure to keep up with by planting beautiful flowers and palm trees they have two separate playgrounds for my child they have an overnight security guard who is well known and visible the apartment staff is professional and sweet they always greet you with a smile and are never negative the apartment manager is very professional and fair she really listening and gives you options in any situation im only moving because i found a house great place to live with a family saddlewood apartmentsjared v ratedthis place could be better and this place could be worse parking is a big crock i have seen more dog feces here than anywhere in my life and you are paying for it just look at the dog park they over charge on the water bill and cant give any explanation why its so high yet i see them waste water on stupid plants and grass up front not to mention the broken water pipes where it looks like a spring in the complex the tlc energy company doesnt exist that you are suppose to pay your water bill to i could go on and on it gets  stars because i havent heard any gun shots yet and there are worse placesbroadway heights apartmentsquate g ratedgreat apartments the place is super quiet and the units are

reviews turner propertiesramonagibbs ratedcustomer service onlyoffice very unprofessional office when signing rental agreement they were under constructionmoving at the time it seems so i let it slide but the ipad that we had to sign and read our rental contract on was cracked horriblywith some glass pierces raised very unprofessional still i let it go because the property was nice and the contract itself was reasonable service we have been trying to get certain maintenance requests addressed since we moved in maintenance personnel came several times and couldnt fix one of the issues and then never came back months ago turner properties said they didnt contract him they just submitted a work order the owner of the house did contract him so in other words its not their fault the issue was not handle in a timely manner when we signed paperwork i had no idea i would go through all this just to get a problem fixed i even ask about this type of stuff read the contract no where in it did it say that maintenance problems could go unfixed due to the home owners preference to contract his own ppl or do it himself now they want to fix the issue using their ppl which is good immediately but now my schedule is not open like it was when we first moved to the place then i was a stay at home mom now i have a new jobno leave of absence yet they only fix stuff during business hours mf and theyre curt with me because i have a schedule they are getting mad because i wont let the maintenance guy into the property the same day we discuss this over the phone like i cannot schedule him to come a certain day not the same day wtf then i ask the representative if i can have a copy of the maintenance log which is typically done after the problem is fixed the first personnel to come to my house had me sign one instead of her simply telling me that they dont do that with their personal maintenance professionals she gave me the run around it was like pulling teeth to get information out of her good customer service is knowing how to handle bad situations with efficiency and empathy i felt neither from these pplwarning ask about the owners preference concerning maintenance issues dont expect to be talked to with respect when things arent all roses with them columbia property managementbrandi s ratedoverall a very unprofessional company i am giving it two stars because everyone i talked to at the company was nice but if you ever need anything from them you will have to stay on top of them to get it done if you have a simple request there is usually only one person in the entire office who can help you and they will usually not be there when you call the first time very disorganized and there does not seem to be much communication between staffthey are pretty slow on maintenance there were things we noted as broken when we moved in and they never sent anyone to fix them they did call several months into our lease to ask if anything was still broken and still never sent anyone my air conditioner went out a couple weeks after i moved in and they sent someone out twice just to tell me that it was broken and needed to be replaced and then it took several days to actually replace it i understand that it might take a day or so to get the unit but i was unable to stay in my house for a week and my rent was not prorated i did contact the owner to ask about this instead of answering me she told me that i had a balance due on my account and referred me to someone else i did not in fact have a balance due so obviously i got the run around there the other problem is the security deposit you will have to put down a security deposit equal to a months rent and if you leave your house in good condition you will be lucky to get half of it back they charge ridiculous amounts for small things for example we were charged  to replace the air filter i chose to rent from this company despite reading bad reviews because i loved the house and was running out of time however i will definitely not be renting from them in the future turner propertiescardette f ratedi relocated from form north carolina to south carolina and was my experience with turner properties is that i found homes that i wanted to rent due to relocating for a job i went i initially called i was told that the house would not be ready until two week later so i decide to drive down and see the location of the house all the blinds were up and i was able to look in the house and like what i saw so i submitted the application and was accepted about  days laterwhat i didn’t understand is that i was charge an addition  on the security deposit with a  credit score then after signing the lease without seeing the house i called and asked if i could just view the house and was told “no” because the code to the lock box had been changed then i asked if someone could just take a  hour out to show me the house that i already put a  deposit on and was told that they lack the staff for that which i thought was very unprofessional the finial issue i had was that a  fee was added to my account for the return of the lock box that i didn’t put on the house also i was told that any damages to the house that i fine i could upload the pictures to my document and that turn out not to be true as far as the house i’m very happy with it so far but i only been in it from  and only had minor issue stains on carpet scratches on flooring we had to replace the float in the toilet so it would stop running broken faucet sprayer and a really bad patch job with spackle throughout the house now i see why they say the house are rented “as is” after they get your deposit almost forgot i was offer a  starbucks gift card for a good reviewsalters property management groupkelli c ratedmonth after month i have to inquire where my rent money is it gets worse each month i call and call and always get an excuse or we will call you back with no call back last month i emailed them twice and never got a response we eventually got the money but no aknowledgement of my emails i give them  stars only because i do feel that the tenants may get better response than we do as the homeowner we have been contacted about repair requests over the years and are updated on mid year inpections this company might be okay to rent from but i would not recommend to home owners lately i always get the rent money around the rd week of the month after my mortgage late fees hit rent money is supposed to be paid out by the th per salters today is the st and they have not paid us on

they are very decent people they probably have more heart than the people in the neighborhood where i own my home the person that wrote that review probably lived there and was kicked out for any
