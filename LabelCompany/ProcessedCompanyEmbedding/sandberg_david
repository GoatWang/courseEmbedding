barriers such as discrimination blatant and subtle sexism and sexual harassment sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles the ultimate

that she is tonedeaf to the struggles faced by the average woman in the workplace sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book stating that she is acutely aware that the
