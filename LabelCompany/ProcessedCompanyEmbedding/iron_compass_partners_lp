materials about needed change at simpson manufacturing co inc news provided by iron compass llc mar    et share this article greenwich conn march   prnewswire  iron compass llc iron compass today sent a letter to the board of directors the board of simpson manufacturing co inc simpson or the company in response to the companys special meeting of stockholders held on march   the special meeting and to announce the release of a presentation regarding the company and its board of directors the board titled change required at simpson manufacturing  the presentation can be found at wwwfixsimpsoncom the full text of the letter follows march   simpson manufacturing co incattn board of directors w las positas blvdpleasanton ca  dear board members we believe sweeping change is necessary at the company and we encourage you to visit our presentation titled change required at simpson manufacturing at wwwfixsimpsoncom the presentation discusses simpsons current problems including the lack of shareholder value creation bloated overhead cost structure misguided strategy with limited disclosure poor capital allocation poor judgement on compensation and a culture of resisting governance change  the need for operational change is of paramount importance but we also remain skeptical about the boards commitment to significant governance change  the board only acted to implement the meaningful change of declassification after losing a fight in which the company attempted to exclude the declassification proposal that we had submitted for inclusion in the companys  annual meeting proxy materials  furthermore we believe that the companys all or none offer to implement the proposals only if stockholders adopted both proposals was disenfranchising because stockholders wishing to retain cumulative voting were disincentivized from voting to declassify the board  we believe the democratic path would have been to allow stockholders to vote on each proposal separately with the boards commitment to implement whichever ones passed  if the company cannot implement material operational change then the board should consider engaging an investment bank to conduct a full review of strategic alternatives  you are likely already well aware of simpsons longstanding appeal to potential acquirers as evidenced by your decision to implement a poison pill  thankfully that poison pill has now been removed and if bidders come calling you should not ignore or dismiss their inquiries  bidders also have the ability and may be welladvised to express their interest directly to us or other shareholders in order to ensure proper engagement from the board regardless now that the board is moving toward full declassification in  stockholders will finally be able to hold the board accountable and enact wholesale changes because a majority of the board will be up for election  in the coming months you have a brief window of opportunity to address the aforementioned problems at the company while we and others closely monitor your performance  in light of the elimination of cumulative voting and considering the opportunity for more substantial board change next year our affiliated investment fund iron compass partners lp is withdrawing its director nomination for the  annual meeting of stockholders  in light of the declassification proposal adopted at the special meeting we are likewise withdrawing our shareholder proposal for declassification that was slated to be included on the companys  proxy statement we continue to closely monitor our investment in the company and expect that our fellow stockholders may also wish to hold the board and management accountable to help build a better simpson sincerely iron compass llc about iron compass iron compass

stockholder of simpson manufacturing co inc simpson or the company nyse ssd iron compass partners lp a fund affiliated with iron compass llc collectively iron compass remains highly concerned about the actions taken by the board of directors of the company the board over the last six months and its reactive tactics in response to our efforts to improve corporate governance on january   the company announced that it intends to hold a special meeting of stockholders on or around march    less than a month before the previouslyscheduled  annual meeting  to vote on amendments to the companys bylaws and certificate of incorporation that would i gradually destagger the board and ii eliminate stockholders right to cumulate votes  while the company makes the suggestion in its press release that the boards action on these matters was the result of shareholder feedback a commitment to welcoming shareholder viewpoints and an effort to enhance governance practices stockholders should know that it comes on the heels of a hardfought effort by iron compass to help the company improve its corporate governance profile  an effort the board vehemently resisted we initially submitted a destaggering proposal to be included on the companys  proxy statement nearly three months ago  for months the board spent company and stockholder resources opposing the validity of our proposal and attempting to exclude the proposal from its proxy in an effort to ultimately deprive stockholders of the opportunity to vote on the matter  only after the securities and exchange commission rendered a response on the matter effectively stating the company does not have a proper basis to exclude the proposal is the board now calling a special meeting to preempt our declassification proposal and to limit shareholders right to cumulate votes in what appears to be a blatant defense tactic  these documents are a matter of public record and can be viewed on the secs website httpwwwsecgovdivisionscorpfincfnoactionaironcompassapdf it is curious to us that the company has decided to incur the additional cost of a special meeting to vote on destaggering and removing cumulative voting after we sent a letter to the secretary of the company on january   indicating our intent to elect for cumulative voting  after all the company could have simply allowed stockholders to vote on destaggering the board and eliminating cumulative voting less than one month later at the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders scheduled to be held on april    we believe that the board is attempting to eliminate the right to cumulate votes at the  annual meeting in an effort to insulate itself from change  we do not believe that eliminating cumulative voting represents good corporate governance in fact isss  sr us proxy voting guidelines recommend a vote against management proposals to eliminate cumulative voting httpswwwissgovernancecomfilepolicysriusvotingguidelinespdf in our minds the boards recent actions are another example of how the companys governance initiatives have only created an appearance of reform for example on october   the board voted to lower outside director term limits from  years to  years and the company explained this change by stating that it was meant to facilitate refreshment and ensure a balance of perspectives  however despite the fact that the average tenure of the current board members is approximately  years the board specifically exempted all existing directors from the term limit  in other words there is now no term limit for the existing directors and the first time a term limit could be enforced for any new director is the year   taking steps to improve the companys governance is critical to reversing the
