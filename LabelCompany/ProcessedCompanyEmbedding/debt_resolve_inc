comtex  management discussion  analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the quarter ending june   is the second quarter of results that demonstrate the financial impact of the first phase of our new strategy the operating income derived in the latest quarter was the first quarterly operating income reported by debt resolve inc this operating income was generated entirely by our new joint venture progress advocates llc to maintain the pace of growth demonstrated in this quarter management is focused on the continued execution of our new business strategy the key elements of our business growth strategy are to  develop progress advocates llc a debt resolve inc joint venture into a profitable growth business that is sustainable in an industry of changing regulations and operating conditions included in this development are industry leading practices from technology integration to customer education and care the external financing option introduced in march  was a key contributor in the quarter ending june   this and revised cash financing options are aligned to match the timing of the client payment with us department of education loan modification approvals an important concern of state and federal regulators to support these goals new technologies are being implemented to integrate the sales and customer service platforms with external data sources this has sped up client approvals and reduced required sales cycle time another key focus is to expand the marketing plan of external lead purchases with prospect selfidentification through branded web properties and social media participation education programs are now available to explain the government programs and terminology and will be expanded to assist clients with all debt management and where to go for other resources the goal is to develop a customer relationship that benefits the consumer with increased financial knowledge develops brand awareness and encourages our inclusion in the consumers social media world  leverage our technology and knowledge of consumer financial dispute negotiations to launch a new internet based product in the consumer to consumer financial dispute resolution and collection space this product named settlit was soft launched in midjune  to provide additional market feedback on the user interface and its value to targeted cohorts settlit utilizes our patented blind bidding system that we license and is the first consumer product available with online negotiations technology designed to be simple to understand easy to use but an effective settlement tool our goal is to make settlit an online leader in this industry in addition the product was designed to be enhanced at a future date to meet the needs of the small business marketplace  enhance the debt resolve solution by integrating it with other services to become a total solution for the arm market the initial focus will be the health industry including hospitals and medical practices our solution will offer a single vendor revenue management system from day one billing through late stage collections our partners in this solution are experienced professionals with health industry experiences including billing call center management and all stages of bill collections another focus will be a complete solution for hospital financing companies our potential partner in providing this solution has been a successful provider of financial services to this industry in each industry the marketing strategy will center on building a customer success story and leveraging that reference account with marketing materials industry speaking engagements and our partners sales team to expand to similar industry accounts  leverage our public equity financial structure by purchasing equity interests in private companies that will benefit from the experience and skills of our management and consultants as well as from holding our publicly traded equity for debt resolve each purchase will aim to be accretive to earnings and leverage our assets with little additional expense for our partners our involvement is aimed to accelerate their growth and profitability in combination with our equity structure this will allow them to monetize their years of hard work building a private company the progress advocates llc joint venture was our first such investment our intent is to attract others that will be synergistic to our current portfolio and offer the benefits described above our strategy plan progress progress advocates llc pa has been in operation for seven months and has met its revenue and expense budget each month in the quarter ending june   it has increased its revenue  sequentially quarter over quarter turned profitable and is now selfsustaining on a cash flow basis the external financing option introduced in march  to allow consumers to pay for its services with a low monthly payment was a key contributor in the quarter ending june   as with other progress advocates payment options the consumer typically doesnt pay until they receive confirmation of their reduced us direct student loan payment amount an important concern of state and federal regulators both of these are industry leading practices other enhancements are being developed to assist the consumer in understanding and managing other nonstudent loans as well as providing consumer financial education these relationship building products should reduce potential churn and increase low cost referral sales settlit our new consumer to consumer debt negotiation and settlement product has been in live beta testing for the last four weeks testers have been enthusiastic over its simplicity and elegance of design it should be ready for a national launch in september followed by a more aggressive marketing effort starting in october negotiations with potential partners for a complete solution for the arm industry are nearing completion and targeted clients have been receptive to our proposal of these new services additional work has been completed with current debt resolve inc clients towards understanding their needs for product enhancements while this is an ongoing process work has been completed on some of these requirements with plans to complete the rest as a key component to this work is a redesign of the user interface to simplify it and convey a softer friendlier tone in what can be a stressful debt collection environment we have been approached by several privately held businesses to discuss the benefits of being part of the debt resolve inc equity family some of these discussions have continued while others werent a good fit for one or the other parties we are excited by the opportunity that our equity structure and the skills of our management team can offer smaller privately held companies results of operations for the three months ended june   compared to the three

liabilities exceeded total current assets in the amount of  and cash and cash equivalents totaling  our working capital as of the date of this report is negative and is not sufficient to fund our plan of operations for the next year the aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we have successfully raised capital for our daytoday operations since our inception however no assurance can be provided that we will continue to be able to do so there is no assurance that any funds secured will be sufficient to enable us to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern to the extent that we are unsuccessful we may need to curtail our operations and implement a plan to extend payables and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations at any time until substantial capital is raised or we reach cash flow breakeven there is also a significant risk of bankruptcy there can be no assurance that any plan to raise additional funding will be successful it is quite challenging in the current environment to raise money depending on the pace of our revenue growth it may not be possible to demonstrate the progress investors require to secure additional funding these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes these estimates and assumptions are based on our managements judgment and available information and consequently actual results could be different from these estimates the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are as follows revenue recognition we earn revenue from collection agencies collection law firms and lenders that implemented our online system our current contracts provide for revenue based on a percentage of the amount of debt collected a fee per settlement or through a flat monthly fee although other revenue models have been proposed most revenue earned to date has been determined using these methods and such revenue is recognized when the settlement amount of debt is collected by the client or at the beginning of the month for a flat fee while the percent of debt collected will continue to be a revenue recognition method going forward other payment models are also being offered to clients and may possibly become our preferred revenue model dependent upon the structure of future contracts revenue may be derived from a combination of set up fees or flat monthly or annual fees with transaction fees upon debt settlement fees per account loaded or fees per settlement revenues for the preparation of student loan documentation services are earned when the company has substantially accomplished the agreedupon deliverables to be entitled to payment by the client for most current active clients these deliverables consist of the completion and delivery of the student loan modification and consolidation documentation package on behalf of the client to the us department of education the company may sell its products separately or in various bundles that include multiple elements such as upfront fees annual renewals and other services we defer any revenue for which the product or service has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required stockbased compensation we follow accounting standards codification subtopic  stockbased compensation asc  the standards require the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date based upon the estimated fair value of the award and requires amortization of the related expense over the employees requisite service period fair values accounting standards codification subtopic  financial instruments asc  requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents accounts payable and accrued liabilities and shortterm borrowings as reflected in the balance sheets approximate fair value because of the shortterm maturity of these instruments all other significant financial assets financial liabilities and equity instruments of the company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows interest rate risk and credit risk where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed we follow accounting standards codification subtopic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  and accounting standards codification subtopic  financial instruments asc  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value none of these statements had an impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows derivative liability we account for derivatives in accordance with asc  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of hedging relationship designation accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives
