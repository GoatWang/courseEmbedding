positive global expansion is gaining momentum as the us developed and many emerging economies are seeing steady modest growth the dow has continued to push higher into new territory and volatility has remained low the administration’s ambitious agenda of deregulation tax reform and fiscal spending has all but stalled as the legislative battles surrounding healthcare and the steady stream of scandals and negative press threaten to push most agenda items into next year the primary risk facing the markets are geopolitical in nature with north korea being the main concern read more q  market commentarythe new year is off to a good start as the overall economic outlook for  is positive an ambitious agenda of deregulation tax reform and fiscal spending from the new administration combined with strengthening fundamentals has pushed the postelection market rally into record setting territory the dow passed  for the first time in january and volatility has been muted for now global expansion is gaining momentum as the us developed and many emerging economies are likely to see steady modest growth most of the risks facing the markets are geo political this year as legislative battles in congress trump’s unpredictability pivotal elections in the uk and eurozone and the fast pace of unfolding world events such as in syria and north korea will drive headlines read more q  market commentary certainly was the year for interesting times beginning with the worst january performance since records have been kept the markets rebounded through the spring summer brought more drama and market volatility to global markets as the surprise outcome of the brexit vote sent markets tumbling a week later markets had recovered and the dow resumed its push into record high territory not to be outdone fall saw the most contentious and vitriolic election season in memory culminating in the unexpected win of donald trump the upset victory triggered a market rally in anticipation of a probusiness friendly policy agenda from the new administration with the dow closing the year out within striking distance of  read more q  market commentarysummer brought more drama and market volatility to global markets during the second quarter of  as the surprising outcome of the brexit vote sent markets tumbling the dow dropped  points the day following the vote and britain saw its largest oneday drop in the british pound to lows not seen in over three decades by the quarter’s end a week later markets had recovered and the dow has resumed its push into record high territory as of this writing the dow has just hit six consecutive alltime highs read more q  market commentarydrama and market volatility reached new extremes during the first quarter of  as the first ten days of january proved to be the worst ever on record for the dow dating back to  the panicked selloff was driven by a steep drop in oil prices and plummeting stock prices in china rather than any change in fundamentals at home this was then followed by a week  rebound during which the markets erased january’s losses and pushed into positive territory fears linger over china’s slowing economy and global uncertainty in general but the us economy showed its resiliency in weathering the storm read more q  market commentary has proven to be a lackluster year when it comes to annual returns but the volatility was anything but boring much of that volatility was fed by news overseas as china’s growth rate continued to slow due to a rebalancing of its economy driving global demand lower and bejing’s decision to devalue their currency however fundamentals at home have steadily strengthened throughout the year and while it was a very modest return at  the sp  index finished the year in positive territory for the th year in a row read more q  market commentarybe careful what you wish for after a flat and unremarkable second quarter u s markets saw a great deal of volatility dropping  over the course of seven days in august giving us our first market correction in over  ⁄ years this volatility was largely due to shortterm emotional reactions to news abroad  headlines have been dominated by china’s economic slowdown  however there was nothing on the home front to justify the pullback the us economy continues to show signs of strong growth and the markets have already bounced back reclaiming nearly  of the  drop in stock prices from august as of this writing the sp  index is only off  from where it began the year read more q  market commentaryoverall the second quarter proved unremarkable for u s markets domestically fundamentals remain strong both the dow and standard  poor’s  indexes set new highs again only to finish the quarter near where they started this was largely due to shortterm emotional reactions to news abroad  headlines have been dominated by greece china and puerto rico’s financial turmoil and difficulties and the volatility those headlines generated read more q  market commentaryafter losing ground in january the major indices had a strong february march saw early losses then solid gains with the dow industrials sp  and russell  all hitting closing highs and the nasdaq closing above  for the first time in  years just shy of its alltime high read more q  market commentaryu s markets continued their climb in the third quarter of  with the dow jones industrial average and the sp  again setting new records concerns over geopolitical instability slowing global growth and a likely fed rate increase in  will drive market volatility as investors nervous of the new highs react to headlines however a global recession remains unlikely and we expect the steady modest growth we have seen in the economy this year to continue through the fourth quarter of  read more q  market commentarymarkets continued to climb in the second quarter of  with the dow jones industrial and sp  setting new records spurred on by increased manufacturing after the slowdown at the beginning of the year due to an abnormally harsh winter we expect to see steady modest growth in the economy through the second half of  as inflation and interest rates remain low going forward the main concern for volatility in the markets is geopolitical instability read more q  market commentaryafter much of the us suffered through a particularly harsh winter spring has arrived bringing with it much milder temperatures in the first quarter of  domestic markets seemed to mirror the weather following a volatile january the markets settled down into a rather calm first quarter with the sp  hovering around  in the last five years negative headlines and volatile markets have become so commonplace that a benign quarter is a nice change of pace as we put the great recession in the rearview mirror and the us economy returns to a more normal business cycle read more q  market commentaryanother new year is upon us and  turned out to be a stellar year for stocks with the financial crisis now firmly in the rearview mirror and the us economy heading into what is shaping up to be a normalizing expansion cycle will  be as spectacular well yes and no read more q  market commentarythe fall season is off to a tumultuous beginning starting with the government shutdown the renewed fight over raising the debt ceiling and a woefully rocky rollout of the enrollment website for the affordable care act also known as obamacare hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed national parks and monuments shuttered and many public services were frozen with no productive resolution to the gridlock in an extremely polarized and unpopular congress read more q  market commentarythe dog days of summer are here but where are the down days it would seem that the perennial pessimistic financial journalism that we all are bombarded with continues to fly in the face of reality while the gloomanddoom worldiscomingtoanend stories and headlines sold a lot of papers and magazines during the dark days of the financial crisis that tag line has gotten pretty stale so here is a reality check read more q  market commentaryspring has arrived and already first quarter  is in the books the dow and the sp  continue to break records surpassing their october  peaks and finished the quarter up  and  respectively while the bull market began  years ago this month psychologically “getting back to where we started” has renewed investor optimism in the markets read more q  market commentarydespite the election the “fiscal cliff” the debt the deficit the fed and the deteriorating eurozone stocks had a great year in  and continued to rise strongly through january the sp  index of large us stocks added a monthly gain of  on top of a
