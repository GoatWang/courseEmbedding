worldwide early history ss tenaris formed through the consolidation of three geographically disparate but not unrelated steel pipe manufacturers dalmine spa of italy siderca saic of argentina and tubos de acero de mexico sa tamsa of mexico dalmine began manufacturing seamless steel tubes in  though it listed on the borsa italiana in  the company was nationalized under mussolinis dictatorship agostino rocca a prime mover in the italian steel industry during the s became managing director of dalmine in  along with his son roberto in  rocca founded compagnia tecnica internazionale later renamed techint providing engineering and construction for industrial development techints south american division formed after agostino emigrated from italy to argentina built the production plants for siderca in campana argentina and tamsa in veracruz mexico operations at both factories began in  techint held ownership interests in both companies and managed the siderca facility tamsa listed on the bolsa mexicana de valores in  and siderca on the bolsa de comercio de buenos aires in  tamsa became the first mexican company to be listed on an exchange in the united states in  through the new york stock exchanges american depository receipts adr program roberto rocca who became president of techint in  initiated the consolidation of the three steel pipe manufacturers as part of a longterm plan to integrate steel and steel product manufacturing with its construction activities especially pipeline construction which occurred on a global basis during the mids techint developed sidercas operations expanding the steel mill facilities at campana and acquiring siat an argentine welded pipe manufacturer in  under robertos direction siderca invested in product research and development and siderca became known worldwide as a lowcost producer of seamless steel pipe and tube through siderca techint acquired a controlling interest in tamsa in  and began to manage that operation known for its electricfurnace pipe and tube mill with paolo rocca as president when italy privatized industry siderca obtained a controlling interest in dalmine in  formation of dst alliance s through the consolidation of the three steel pipe companies techint formed a new company dst alliance the worlds largest producer of seamless steel pipe dst formed a  billion entity with dalmine valued at  million siderca at  billion and tamsa at more than  million dalmine siderca and tamsa continued to operate autonomously but in a coordinated manner with all three companies using the dst trademark production at each company tended towards different kinds of pipe with little overlap or competitive disadvantages siderca produced welded and seamless pipe casings tubings and line pipe for the oil and gas industry in addition to these products tamsa produced mechanical and structural seamless pipe primarily used by the automotive industry dalmine produced seamless steel pipe applied to automotive mechanical and machinery uses while each company maintained a significant hold on local markets they exported a significant amount of product as well with siderca and tamsa exporting about  percent of production and dalmine about  percent of production as president of dst rocca intended to exploit these varying strengths in the international marketplace to create an efficient steel pipe supply line to industrial projects worldwide particularly by integrating management services with product supply through alliances with several steel pipe manufacturers worldwide dst improved its base of product and technology in  tamsa and corporacion venezolana de guayana formed tavsa to acquire control of the sidor seamless steel tube mill a  supply and licensing agreement with nkk corporation of japan gave siderca access to carbon steel products as well as to advanced technology for premium pipe used in deepwater oil and gas recovery in turn siderca supplied nkk with steel pipe in  siderca

tube manufacturing facility in sault ste marie ontario which operated under the name algoma tubes siderca managed the plant and dst handled marketing and distribution dst changed its name to tenaris in april  and announced its new corporate identity at the houston offshore technology conference tenaris took its name from the latin word tenax the root of tenacious which means to hold a firm grip the name reflected the companys international standing in that the word could be understood in many languages an advertising campaign followed emphasizing tenariss position as a global network of integrated steel pipe manufacturing and supply management operations through global and local trade publications tenaris introduced the brand along with the companys eight steel mills offering a variety of services that utilized the combined capacities of the mills  establishing presence in international service and supply with production and technology in place dst began to offer project and supply chain management services from product design through distribution and inventory one of the companys first major successes involved collaboration with shell canada to meet the needs of extracting heavy oil at the peace river oilfield in alberta through intensive study and experimentation at the tamsa and dalmine mills tenaris pipeline services provided shell canada with line pipe capable of handling steam injection underground necessary to thin heavy oil for easier extraction the new grade of pipe ranging from  to  inches in diameter withstood temperatures up to  degrees fahrenheit and pressure up to  pounds per square inch tenaris delivered the pipe in january  the successful implementation of that technology earned the company orders from other companies requiring highgrade line pipe for steam injection methods of heavy oil extraction tenariss technological capabilities attracted business from companies involved in offshore oil and gas extraction tenaris designed and produced pipe for the shallow water portion of an oil and gas export pipeline at horn mountain in the gulf of mexico the pipe had to meet specifications of the american petroleum

early history ss tenaris formed through the consolidation of three geographically disparate but not unrelated steel pipe manufacturers dalmine spa of italy siderca saic of argentina and tubos de acero de mexico sa tamsa of mexico dalmine began manufacturing seamless steel tubes in  though it listed on the borsa italiana in  the company was nationalized under mussolinis dictatorship agostino rocca a prime mover in the italian steel industry during the s became managing director of dalmine in  along with his son roberto in  rocca founded compagnia tecnica internazionale later renamed techint providing engineering and construction for industrial development techints south american division formed after agostino emigrated from italy to argentina built the production plants for siderca in campana argentina and tamsa in veracruz mexico operations at both factories began in  techint held ownership interests in both companies and managed the siderca facility tamsa listed on the bolsa mexicana de valores in  and siderca on the bolsa de comercio de buenos aires in  tamsa became the first mexican company to be listed on an exchange in the united states in  through the new york stock exchanges american depository receipts adr program roberto rocca who became president of techint in  initiated the consolidation of the three steel pipe manufacturers as part of a longterm plan to integrate steel and steel product manufacturing with its construction activities especially pipeline construction which occurred on a global basis during the mids techint developed sidercas operations expanding the steel mill facilities at campana and acquiring siat an argentine welded pipe manufacturer in  under robertos direction siderca invested in product research and development and siderca became known worldwide as a lowcost producer of seamless steel pipe and tube through siderca techint acquired a controlling interest in tamsa in  and began to manage that operation known for its electricfurnace pipe and tube mill with paolo rocca as president when italy privatized industry siderca obtained a controlling interest in dalmine in  formation of dst alliance s through the consolidation of the three steel pipe companies techint formed a new company dst alliance the worlds largest producer of seamless steel pipe dst formed a  billion entity with dalmine valued at  million siderca at  billion and tamsa at more than  million dalmine siderca and tamsa continued to operate autonomously but in a coordinated manner with all three companies using the dst trademark production at each company tended towards different kinds of pipe with little overlap or competitive disadvantages siderca produced welded and seamless pipe casings tubings and line pipe for the oil and gas industry in addition to these products tamsa produced mechanical and structural seamless pipe primarily used by the automotive industry dalmine produced seamless steel pipe applied to automotive mechanical and machinery uses while each company maintained a significant hold on local markets they exported a significant amount of product as well with siderca and tamsa exporting about  percent of production and dalmine about  percent of production as president of dst rocca intended to exploit these varying strengths in the international marketplace to create an efficient steel pipe supply line to industrial projects worldwide particularly by integrating management services with product supply through alliances with several steel pipe manufacturers worldwide dst improved its base of product and technology in  tamsa and corporacion venezolana de guayana formed tavsa to acquire control of the sidor seamless steel tube mill a  supply and licensing agreement with nkk corporation of japan gave siderca access to carbon steel products as well as to advanced technology for premium pipe used in deepwater oil and gas recovery in turn siderca supplied nkk with steel pipe in  siderca

extracting heavy oil at the peace river oilfield in alberta through intensive study and experimentation at the tamsa and dalmine mills tenaris pipeline services provided shell canada with line pipe capable of handling steam injection underground necessary to thin heavy oil for easier extraction the new grade of pipe ranging from  to  inches in diameter withstood temperatures up to  degrees fahrenheit and pressure up to  pounds per square inch tenaris delivered the pipe in january  the successful implementation of that technology earned the company orders from other companies requiring highgrade line pipe for steam injection methods of heavy oil extraction tenariss technological capabilities attracted business from companies involved in offshore oil and gas extraction tenaris
