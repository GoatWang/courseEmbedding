fulfilling year career at jpmorgan chase and a stint as cfo and managing director for citi smith barney you might say that stacy brandom is now – like hebrew national but from the other side of the aisle – answering to a “higher authority” since october   she has been cfo and executive vp of trinity wall street one of the leading episcopal parishes in the nation and as she puts it a church with “tentacles” in new york’s history and its real estate market in what brandom calls a “soup to nuts position” she oversees trinitys treasury and finance departments its investment portfolio plus human resources for  employees some parttime technology the historic churches and other facilities landmarked and non the trinity cemetery and the trinity conference center as a member of trinity wall street’s senior executive team she works with clergy and lay staff and trinity’s vestry in the anglican faith akin to a board to guide the strategies and decisionmaking for the church in support of its mission trinity’s commitment to “a world of good” includes extensive educational programming a significant local and global grants program as well as a worldclass music program its centerpiece being the trinity choir the programs at trinity are supported by its commercial real estate holdings which include six million square feet centered in the hudson square area in lower manhattan “there is always the question of striking the right balance between protecting trinity’s patrimony for future generations and all the great things we want to do today” said brandom  “i have a profound sense of responsibility about helping to make these decisions which gives me the sense of contributing to the institution” she says her husband’s dubbed her “church lady” given her long and important connection to her church growing up and her own larchmont avenue church a presbyterian church in larchmont ny  she currently teaches sunday school there and heads its finance committee lucky church but she has long had her feet planted in business a native kansan she holds a bba in accounting and information systems from the university of north texas and an mba in finance and marketing from northwestern’s j l kellogg graduate school of management she and her husband david a jazz saxophonist and teacher left the midwest after stacy completed graduate school thinking it would “be great fun to experience the big city for a few years”  twentyfive years later they are still here “we made our lives and raised our children here  we’ve grown to call new york our home our schedule may seem a bit confounding but it works for us  while i’m in the city during the work week dave could be home managing the household then evenings and weekends dave goes to work and i take the parenting reins” their three children all boys are now  just graduated from high school  graduated college and  married last summer between undergrad and graduate school stacy worked for arthur andersen in its consulting division then after kellogg she started at chemical bank in  “many mergers later” she left jpmorgan chase in  having served as cfo and senior vp for the corporate sector cfo and senior vp for the commercial banking group and managing director in the investment bank she said it was a difficult decision to leave chase for citigroup smith barney “many of my best friends are alums or still work at jpmorgan chase” brandom noted “citi’s business platform gave me a great opportunity to learn new things especially the asset management and private client business” she said “but i got to the point where i was hungry to do something different i decided to take a break to rethink priorities and what i wanted to do with my life although i had a great deal of intellectual fulfillment during my career at chase and citi and had the opportunity to work with supersmart people every day with a sense of camaraderie which i loved i still felt that i was at a place in my life where i wanted to find more creativity and meaning in my daytoday work” she left citigroup to take a sabbatical and think through her options after taking a break she formed brandom advisors llc which provided financial advice to individuals families and small businesses she was also busy exploring opportunities including at notforprofits “i’d been very much focused on improving business results quarterly reporting the things that drive a business forward” she said “those things are great and it was a fun and thrilling career path given the changes in the financial services industry i was right in the middle of it” when she was recruited for the job at trinity though she knew it was what she was seeking “i knew that i wanted to make a contribution to this organization” she said a healthy tension trinity which boasts alexander hamilton as a former parishioner and george templeton strong as a former comptroller is now the most diverse episcopal parish in new york worshipers from all five boroughs attend services each sunday including a sunday evening compline service at st paul’s chapel home to the ministry to first responders and recovery workers after the september th terrorist attacks on the world trade center over  groups use trinity’s parish hall and spaces which includes the newly opened charlotte’s place on greenwich street its concert series are renowned with the growth of residential population in lower manhattan enrollment at trinity’s preschool is back up and over  kids participate in its youth choruses brandom is currently involved in planning and “budgeting” for trinity’s involvement in the upcoming commemorations of the th anniversary of  an event that profoundly affected the parish located in the shadow of the world trade center brandom gave a preview of the th anniversary week “trinity has planned a full calendar of events including many stirring musical events in st paul’s chapel and trinity church as well as daily prayers for peace and a symposium hosted by krista tippett offering perspectives on  and how it changed all of us james cooper trinity’s rector is asking those that participate to ‘remember to love we want to remember and honor those who perished by generating a postanniversary community committed to reconciliation and peace’”  trinity church itself is at the foot of wall street on broadway the most dramatic change since  has to do with the parish’s st paul’s chapel manhattan’s oldest public building in continuous use pre it was known as a revolutionary war building where george washington worshipped after his inauguration at federal hall and many times thereafter perhaps  tourists would visit per week then came  recovery workers received roundtheclock care in the chapel and it gathered a new historic significance along with ash and grime brandom said that it is now visited weekly by  to  people trinity has had to make a major investment in the facility guards updated electrical installation of an adacompliant bathroom and translation of the english language brochure into spanish german french and japanese an iphone app is being developed brandom’s challenge is expressed in the title of a book by john wimberly to which she contributed the foreword the business of the church the uncomfortable truth that faithful ministry requires effective management “it’s a good book for clergy to read or for those who participate on religious institution boards” brandom explained   “what is the ‘uncomfortable truth’  to actually make an impact on the world you need to manage your human resources physical resources and financial resources “we need to face it at any religious institution you still have to use your resources to support your physical plant and your staff and congregation but you also want to be able to do good works in the world – and help people who need it it’s a healthy tension” much of trinity’s budget helps people worldwide but said brandom “trinity also provides significant resources to make the church welcoming both as a place of worship and historically significant institution “we manage our assets as a business would – taking the right risks setting the right market rents – while at the same time being serious about building our community  in a business the framework for making a decision is pretty clear you do what will protect you from risks and help you make the most money” she explained “in a notforprofit sometimes you need to be clear what your objectives are what the impetus is” were there other adjustments to notforprofit life “i’m not going to say i’m never frustrated by the pace of decision making but i feel as though i’m very grounded in the situation trinity has been here for  years and wants to be here another  years we have the luxury of being very deliberate in our decision making” she added “and different is not so bad” stacy riggs brandom  north texan search this site unt home unt insider transcripts career center
