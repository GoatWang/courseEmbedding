wilmot  latham  watkins llp  margaret m zwisler  latham  watkins memorandum opinion and order joseph h mckinley district judge this matter is before the court on a motion by defendant insight

richard p rouco and mark k gray appeared on behalf of the plaintiffs and margaret zwisler jennifer l giordano and janice m theriot appeared on behalf of defendant fully briefed and argued this matter is ripe for decision i standard of review before the court may grant a motion for summary judgment it must find that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law fed r civ p a the moving party bears the initial burden of specifying the basis for its motion and identifying that portion of the record that demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact celotex corp v catrett  us    once the moving party satisfies this burden the nonmoving party thereafter must produce specific facts demonstrating a genuine issue of fact for trial anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    although the court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party the nonmoving party must do more than merely show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts matsushita elec indus co ltd v zenith radio corp  us    instead the federal rules of civil procedure require the nonmoving party to present specific facts showing that a genuine factual issue exists by citing to particular parts of materials in the record or by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence    of a genuine dispute fed r civ p c the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving partys position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the nonmoving party anderson  us at  it is against this standard the court reviews the following facts ii background plaintiffs allege that insights policy or practice requiring cable subscribers to rent the cable boxes from insight in order to receive insights interactive premium cable ipc services constitutes an illegal tying scheme that unreasonably restrains trade in violation of section  of the sherman act  usc §  ipc is unique in that it is capable of twoway communication between the subscriber and insight and includes such services as payperview an interactive programming guide and ondemand options plaintiffs argue that consumers are unable to purchase the technology necessary to receive ipc from either insight or on the open market therefore plaintiffs allege that insight has impermissibly tied its ipc services to its own proprietary cable box a complete recitation of the facts of the case can be found in judge simpsons memorandum opinion and order dn  entered june   and is incorporated herein by reference defendant now moves for summary judgment on the third amended complaint arguing that plaintiffs failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute about whether insight violated antitrust law by forcing plaintiffs to lease a settop box from insight in order to obtain twoway interactive premium cable services iii discussion a tying arrangement is an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different or tied product or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier ctunify inc v nortel networks inc  fed appx   th cir  quoting eastman kodak co v image technical servs inc  us    citation omitted tying arrangements are unlawful because they harm existing competitors or create barriers to entry of new competitors in the market for the tied product jefferson parish hosp dist no  v hyde  us    abrogated in part on other grounds by illinois tool works inc v independent ink inc  us      or will force buyers into giving up the purchase of substitutes for the tied product united states v loews  us    abrogated in part on other grounds by illinois tool works  us  brantley v nbc universal inc  fd   th cir  citations omitted the essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the sellers exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms when such forcing is present competition on the merits in the market for the tied item is restrained and the sherman act is violated jefferson parish  us at  in some situations a tying arrangement can be created without a direct requirement that the plaintiff purchase the tied product in order to purchase the tying product valassis communications inc v news america inc  wl   ed mich jan   courts have found tying arrangements where the buyers only economically viable option is to purchase both the tying and the tied product shamrock marketing inc v bridgestone bandag inc  fsuppd   wd ky  see also marts v xerox inc  fd   th cir  stating that products were not tied unless the package was the only viable economic option and separate purchases were prohibitively expensive the sixth circuit also recognizes a tying arrangement when a deal induces all rational buyers of the tying product to accept the tied product shamrock marketing  f suppd at  n  courts have also inferred the existence of a tying arrangement where the circumstances surrounding a transaction for all practical purposes force a buyer into purchasing the tied product where the buyer is free to take either product by itself there is no tying problem    northern pac ry co v united states  us   n   a contracts policies and practices there is no contractual provision requiring that insight customers rent an insight settop box in order to participate in the full panoply of digital services likewise the policies and practices of insight reflect that insight did not condition the rental of an insight cable settop box to access ipc services see eg valassis communications  wl   insights written policy permitted its subscribers to use their own lawfully acquired settop boxes that were compatible with insights systems insight provided this information to subscribers and potential subscribers on its public website specifically the website provided in part that it is our policy to support those digital receivers which may be provided directly by our customers we comply fully with all federal regulations governing the customers right to facilitate their authorized receipt of our cable services through lawful customerowned equipment by offering a cablecard for lease that will provide access to certain insight services that require descrambling sof ¶¶  additionally the annual rate cards distributed to providers had a bundled price for digital subscribers who leased from insight and a separate unbundled price for subscribers who provide their own digital receiver subject to certain specifications from a recognized retailer id at ¶  the rate card further provided that subscribers had the option to purchase their own compatible cable receiver from a variety of recognized area retail and electronics stores id at ¶  thus the customer information on insights website and rate cards indicates that customers were free to obtain an approved noninsight settop box the court is aware that under frequently asked questions on insights website in response to the question do i need a cable box if my television is cableready insight states yes with digital cable an insight digital settop box is required to receive all the programming and convenient features like the interactive guide and on demand tv insight will bring the box to your home and set it up for you rouco decl exhibit  faqdigital cable however this statement alone does not reflect a policy or practice on the part of insight of requiring an insight cable settop box to access ipc services in fact this statement is completely contrary to the other statements contained on the website and insights practice of permitting customers to use their own settop boxes further insights website contained a specific question about whether a subscriber could provide his own settop box and the answer was clearly yes sof ¶¶  brecher decl ¶  accordingly given the bulk of the policy information on insights website the court finds that no genuine dispute exists regarding whether insights policies or practices required customers to lease an insight settop box to subscribe to interactive digital cable television b economically viable option plaintiffs also failed to present any evidence demonstrating that insight made leasing a settop box from it the only economically viable option for its subscribers to obtain twoway services as discussed above courts have found tying arrangements where the buyers only economically viable option is to purchase both the tying and the tied product shamrock marketing  f suppd at  see also marts  fd at  stating that products were not tied unless the package was the only viable economic option and separate purchases were prohibitively expensive virtual maintenance inc v prime computer inc  fd   th cir the cost of the bundle was  but the cost of the tying product purchased alone was  to  court stated that a tying arrangement clearly exists here because the large price differential between software support alone and the software supporthardware maintenance package induces all rational buyers of primes software support to accept its hardware maintenance amerinet inc v xerox corp  fd    th cir the eighth circuit granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant even though the tying product was more expensive by itself because it was not prohibitively more expensive than the bundle in the present case the record reflects that insight charged less for the tying product alone than as part of the bundle during the relevant time period in fact while the parties disagree on the amount of the savings plaintiffs expert testified that subscribers paid at least  less to insight if they used their own settop box than if they leased a box from insight singer decl ¶  additionally insights  rate card lists the rate for the bundled package of insight digital  plus the lease of settop box and remote control at  the rate card price for just insight digital  compatible features only ie without the lease of a settop box and remote control was  the rate card noted that the  price was available only to customers who provide their own digital receiver subject to certain specifications from a recognized retailer dn  ex b rate card the plaintiffs have not identified any authority to support a finding of coercion based on lack of economic viability when a defendant charges the same price or less for the tying product standing alone coercion is not present in such a situation because a defendants pricing of the tying product did not force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms jefferson parish  us at  thus under the facts of this case insight did not use any alleged power over the price of the tying product to compel the plaintiffs to lease a box c percentage of subscribers that lease settop box furthermore contrary to plaintiffs argument the fact that  percent of subscribers chose to lease a settop box is not sufficient to create a material dispute of fact on the issue of coercion under the facts of the case plaintiffs argue that the court should infer coercion from that fact that in mid over  percent of all insight digital cable tv subscribers leased an insight digital settop box during this time insight had  customers of those customers  customers had cablecards used in cable ready devices and  customers used their own noninsight settop boxes however it is wellestablished that even  percent of bundled sales does not itself indicate that two products have been tied together areeda  hovenkamp antitrust law ¶ b at  d ed  see eg freeland v att corp  frd   sdny rejecting the argument that because  percent of subscribers who purchased wireless services from carriers also purchased handsets from the same carriers demonstrated coercion here it is undisputed that commercial realities have limited the number of insightcompatible twoway devices available to consumers for purchase at retail settop manufacturers exercised their own independent business decision in deciding not to sell twoway devices directly to consumers at retail representatives of motorola and pace averred that insight never sought to preclude or discourage them from offering settop boxes at retail or to dictate the prices at which they might have done so sof ¶¶  in fact at the oral argument plaintiffs even recognized that they understand that thats motorola and paces decision not to sell a retail box they didnt want to go to retail they have their own reasons for that may   oral argument at  where decisions of third parties produce the practical effect of limited consumer choices that is legally insufficient to establish coercion for a tying claim konik v champion valley physicians hosp medical center  fd   d cir  thus the fact that a high percentage of subscribers leased boxes from insight to obtain twoway services does not demonstrate that insight unlawfully forced them to do so furthermore the record reflects that during the time period in question insight permitted its subscribers to use settop boxes that were available to them from other approved sources for example one customer purchased the motorolas dcp devices which allowed subscribers to participate in the cable companys two way services and insight permitted him to use it to access all of its services including its twoway services sof ¶¶   d insights promotion and control of set top boxes as discussed above in the absence of an explicit tying agreement courts have also inferred the existence of a tying arrangement where the circumstances surrounding a transaction for all practical purposes force a buyer into purchasing the tied product shamrock marketing  fsuppd   n  wd ky  see ticxpress inc v omni promotions co of georgia  fd   th cir  the facts and circumstances related to insights promotion and control of its settop boxes do not independently support the inference of a tying arrangement  dissemination of settop box policy plaintiffs claim that a reasonable juror could infer that leasing an insight settop box was required to subscribe to ipc services because insight did not clearly disseminate its settop box policy to subscribers plaintiffs state that they were not aware of the option to use a noninsight settop box and receive all the same features and services available with insight digital cable jarrett dep  eilers dep   grace dep  contrary to plaintiffs argument insight is not obligated to publish a written policy at all much less to ensure that it was clearly disseminated to plaintiffs areeda ¶ a defendant has no obligation to offer or remind the buyer of an option to buy product a alone unijax inc v champion intern inc  fd   d cir a manufacturers use of strong persuasion encouragement or cajolery to the point of obnoxiousness to induce its retailer to buy its full line of products does not however amount to actual coercion id at   obligation to create a secondary market plaintiffs argue that insight controls the settop box market through a leaseonly option and precludes development of a secondary market where subscribers could sell their used boxes plaintiffs contend that because insight does not offer a purchase option it owns the vast majority of all cable settop boxes currently in use and is essentially the only purchaser of settop boxes programmed to work on insights system it is undisputed that insight does not manufacture settop boxes nor does it control the market decision of the companies that do furthermore section  of the sherman act does not give a purchaser the right to buy a product that the seller does not wish to offer for sale jefferson parish  us at  n  thus contrary to plaintiffs argument insight is not obligated to create a secondary market for settop boxes  insights requirements on use of thirdparty settop box plaintiffs argue that insights imposition of requirements on the use of third party settop boxes forces subscribers to lease settop boxes from insight where a contract or franchising agreement provides that buyers shall use only the seller or a source approved by the seller to purchase the tied product the courts have looked to see if the approval clause was reasonable and permitted the buyer meaningful freedom of choice or whether it is manipulated by the seller to force the buyer to purchase the tied product from the seller ticxpress inc  fd at  insights website provided that in order for us to authorize receipt of scrambled insight cable services through a settop receiver or digital cableready set that a customer provides the customer must establish to insights reasonable satisfaction that such device is unaltered from its original condition produced by a recognized and legitimate manufacturer of such devices and the device must be compatible with insights technical specifications to prevent physical or electronic harm to insights system rouco decl ex  faqdigital cable plaintiffs maintain that because insight did not publish specific technological criteria for customer provided settop boxes ticxpress supports the conclusion that the approval clause forced subscribers to lease the set boxes from insight the decision in ticxpress is distinguishable from the facts of the present case in ticxpress the plaintiff complained that the defendant omni promotions the exclusive omni arena promoter required outside concert promoters to use a specific ticketing service topcol as a condition of leasing the omni arena the defendant however pointed to language in its contract with outside concert promoters that allowed the concert promoters to select their own ticketing agency for the event subject to defendants approval id at  in denying summary judgment the court found there was no written information provided in advance that spelled out the specifications or procedures for seeking approval id another factor significant to the denial of summary judgment in ticxpress was that no promoter had ever requested permission to use another ticket agency notwithstanding the approval clause because they understood through years of dealing with the defendant that they were required to use defendants selected ticketing agent id at  additionally the defendant had never approved another ticket agency id in contrast to ticxpress the record here reflects that other insight customers requested to use their own twoway communication settop box and insight had approved the request also the customers who requested to use their own twoway communication settop boxes called insight to confirm that the device was compatible and to provide the serial number of the box so insight could confirm the device had not been stolen wright supp decl ¶¶  as a result unlike the facts present in ticxpress the record does not support a finding that insight cable subscribers were forced for all practical purposes to use the insights settop boxes id at  e dr hal singers opinions the opinions of plaintiffs liability expert dr hal singer are not sufficient to create a genuine dispute about whether insight forced subscribers to lease a settop box from insight to obtain twoway services first dr singers opinions are based on premium cable service as the tying product this court has specifically held that premium cable could not be the tying product instead the tying product is interactive premium cable services second dr singers opinion that insight digital cable tv subscribers who provide their own settop box suffer quality degradation is not supported by the record instead the record reflects that insights interactive premium cable service was available to any customer who leased a cablecard and inserted it into their own compatible twoway device no evidence exists regarding the quality of insights ipc services provided to those customers finally much of dr singers opinions rely on general information of cable companies in fcc reports dr singer does not utilize evidence related to actual insight equipment or practices during this period of time in considering the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs the court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute about whether insight violated §  of the sherman act by forcing plaintiffs to lease an insight settop box in order to receive the full benefit of insights interactive premium cable services iv conclusion for the reasons set forth above it is hereby ordered that the motion by defendant insight communications company lp for summary judgment dn  is granted the court will enter a judgment consistent with this opinion footnotes  on july   the district court in in re cox enterprises inc settop cable television box antitrust litigation  wl  wd okla july   issued an opinion denying summary judgment on the claim that cox enterprises illegally forced customers to rent a settop box in order to gain full access to its premium cable services in violation of the sherman act  usc §  in re cox enterprises is distinguishable from the present case unlike the defendant in in re cox enterprises insight did not expressly condition the rental of a settop box from it as a required step in obtaining ipc services
