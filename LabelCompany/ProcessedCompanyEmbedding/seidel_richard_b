diameter during expiration c decrease the intrathoracic space d increase elastic recoil during expiration ans b the diaphragm is the dominant muscle during respiration it contracts and pushes downward during inspiration to increase the intrathoracic space the external intercostal muscles increase the ap diameter during inspiration and the internal intercostals decrease the lateral diameter during expiration dif cognitive level understanding comprehension ref p  obj nursing process—assessment msc physiologic integrity physiologic adaptation  the fifth vital sign is a pain b orientation c

patients who complain of pain c repeated intensity documentation be made of the course of pain relief for all patients d pain be assessed on surgical patients ans c tjc requires pain assessment on all admissions repeated assessments for pain regardless of the initial complaint or surgical experience and repeated intensity documentation of the course of pain relief for all patients dif cognitive

in neonates c is predictable with the same circumstances d is affected by emotions and quality of sleep ans d the perception of pain is variable and is affected by emotions cultural background sleep deprivation previous pain experience and age perception of pain is different among different cultures neonates do feel pain but perception of pain cannot be assessed in neonates each circumstance will provide different pain perception dif cognitive level understanding comprehension ref p  obj nursing process—assessment msc physiologic integrity physiologic adaptation  the nurse assesses the blood pressure to be  mm hg and records  as the a pulse pressure b pulse deficit c afterload d preload ans a systolic pressure – diastolic pressure  pulse pressure pulse deficit occurs when the number of pulse beats counted at the radial pulse is less than those counted at the same time at the heart afterload and preload are not measured according to blood pressures dif cognitive level applying application ref p  obj nursing process—assessment msc physiologic integrity reduction of risk potential  hypertension in the adult is generally defined as pressure in excess of a  mm hg plus the patient’s age b  mm hg c  mm hg d  mm hg ans b optimal blood pressure is below  mm hg according to jnc hypertension continues to be defined as  mm hg and higher prehypertension is the range between optimal and hypertension the equation that systolic blood pressure should be less than  mm hg plus the patient’s age is no longer the acceptable definition dif cognitive level remembering knowledge

cognitive level remembering knowledge ref p  obj nursing process—assessment msc physiologic integrity physiologic adaptation  if a sufficiently large cuff is unavailable to fit an obese arm which technique may be used to assess blood pressure a wrap a standard cuff around the deltoid area and place the stethoscope over the radial artery b wrap a standard cuff around the forearm and place the stethoscope over the radial artery c wrap a standard cuff around the thigh and place the stethoscope on the dorsalis pedis d wrap a pediatric cuff around the ankle and place the stethoscope on the popliteal artery ans b a technique to use when assessing the blood pressure of an obese person and you only have a standard adult cuff is to wrap the cuff around the smaller forearm and place the stethoscope over the radial artery this substitution should comply with the cuff standard of one third to one half of the circumference of the limb the cuff should be wrapped around the forearm not the deltoid or thigh areas a pediatric cuff will not fit the ankle dif cognitive level applying application ref p  obj nursing process—assessment msc physiologic integrity physiologic adaptation  postural hypotension is defined as a  when the patient stands compared with sitting or supine readings a systolic pressure drop of more than  mm hg with a pulse rate increase b pulse rate decrease with a systolic pressure increase of at least  mm hg c diastolic pressure increase of more than  mm hg and no pulse rate changes d pulse rate decrease and diastolic pressure decrease of more than  mm hg ans a postural hypotension orthostatic hypotension represents a significant decrease in systolic pressure greater than  mm hg an accompanied drop in diastolic pressure and a rise in pulse rate whenever the position changes from sitting to standing dif cognitive level understanding comprehension ref p  obj nursing process—assessment msc physiologic integrity reduction of risk potential  the most frequent cause of serious hypertension in children is a heart disease b liver failure c renal disease d rheumatic fever ans c if the systolic blood pressure is elevated and the diastolic blood pressure is not anxiety may be responsible blood pressure in children varies by gender and height at any age hypertension in children is becoming more common because of the increased prevalence of overweight children usually hypertension is caused by kidney disease renal arterial disease coarctation of the aorta and pheochromocytoma not heart disease liver failure or rheumatic fever dif

width covers a less than half of the upper arm b less than  inches of the lower arm c more than two thirds of the upper arm d more than  inches of the lower arm ans c cuffs that are too wide will underestimate blood pressure which would occur with a cuff that covers more than two thirds of the upper arm dif cognitive level understanding comprehension ref p  obj nursing process—assessment msc physiologic integrity physiologic adaptation  your yearold patient is complaining of right knee pain she has a history of osteoarthritis for which she is given antiinflammatory medication to assess her right knee pain you should ask her if a the current pain is similar to previous pain b the left knee hurts as well c she took pain medication last night d the pain gets better when she sits ans c it is most appropriate to ask a present tense evaluation question such as whether the patient took her pain medication the question should be simply worded without the addition of multiple factors to consider you should refrain from asking older patients to compare past with present symptoms because recollection may be uncertain and recollection of past pain is sometimes not readily achieved systematic evaluation of the right knee should be completed before any additional symptoms are evaluated knowing that the pain gets better when she sits does not help assess the right knee pain dif
