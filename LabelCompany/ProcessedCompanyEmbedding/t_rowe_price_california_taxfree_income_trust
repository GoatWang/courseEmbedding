will be agreeing to become a shareholder of a series of a maryland corporation the names of the new maryland corporations and their series will differ slightly from the names of the existing trusts and funds due to their new structure for example the term inc will be added to the names of the maryland corporations and t rowe price will be officially added to the beginning of certain funds names in addition the subtrusts of the t rowe price california taxfree income trust and the t rowe price state taxfree income trust will be organized as series of one maryland corporation to be called t rowe price state taxfree funds inc the reorganizations will not result in any changes to the investment objectives principal investment strategies investment adviser portfolio managers b or f plans operations or service providers of any of the funds in addition the fees and expenses including the management fee will also remain the same shareholder account values immediately after a reorganization will be the same as immediately before the reorganization each reorganization is expected to occur on or around the close of business on september   the  closing date  although this date may be adjusted if deemed appropriate in accordance with the terms of the plan has the board approved the reorganizations at its meeting on october   the board approved the plan and determined that each reorganization should be submitted to shareholders of the relevant fund if shareholders of a fund approve the proposal the trust officers will implement the reorganization transactions in accordance with the plan on behalf of the fund what does the board recommend the board unanimously recommends that shareholders of each fund vote for the proposal with respect to their fund page  what is the reason for the proposal the trusts were organized as massachusetts business trusts in  and  a popular form of organization for mutual funds at the time over the last few decades the percentage of mutual funds organized as massachusetts business trusts has declined as an increasing number of funds have organized as maryland corporations the increasing use of the maryland corporation structure for mutual funds is generally thought to be the result of certain advantages offered by maryland law to mutual funds in unanimously approving each reorganization the board evaluated the information reasonably necessary to determine that the reorganization would be in the best interests of the relevant fund and its shareholders and that the interests of the funds shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the reorganization t rowe price and the board believe that the funds will benefit in several ways by reorganizing from massachusetts business trusts to maryland corporations o   more efficient proxy process  maryland and massachusetts have different proxy requirements which create significant redundancies and inefficiencies during a proxy campaign involving multiple funds domiciled in the two different jurisdictions for example each trusts trust agreement the current organizational document for the trust requires a record date of not more than  days prior to a shareholder meeting whereas maryland corporate law requires a record date of not more than  days nor less than  days prior to a shareholder meeting the longer solicitation period available in maryland would provide shareholders with more time to consider and vote on proposals and it could also result in fewer adjournments and lower proxy solicitation expenses in addition the current trust agreements of the trusts require more shareholder votes than would be required under maryland law to constitute a quorum the trust agreements require a majority of votes entitled to be cast at the meeting compared to marylands minimum requirement of onethird of the shares entitled to vote because of these differences it has been difficult for the t rowe price funds organized as maryland corporations to share the same proxy statement with the t rowe price funds organized as massachusetts business trusts and be part of the same proxy campaign even though all of the funds are holding a shareholder meeting at the same location on the same date generally all of the maryland corporations have been included in a single proxy statement and all of the massachusetts business trusts have been included in a separate proxy statement which mails approximately  days after the proxy statement for the maryland corporations this has fostered confusion for shareholders who own shares of t rowe price funds organized under both massachusetts page  and maryland law and led to questions regarding the inability to vote all of their shares at the same time each reorganization will benefit shareholders by making future complexwide proxy campaigns for proposals impacting all of the t rowe price funds such as the election of directors less confusing to shareholders and more efficient and less costly to administer o   operational streamlining  the reorganizations will serve to standardize and conform the corporate governance of the funds with the other funds in the t rowe price family of funds this standardization is expected to streamline the administration of the funds which may potentially result in cost savings to t rowe price and the funds and their shareholders and more effective administration by eliminating differences in governing documents and controlling law t rowe price is headquartered in maryland the majority of its staff is located in maryland and the overwhelming majority of the t rowe price funds are already domiciled in maryland because t rowe price staff is in maryland and not massachusetts all organizational documents may be hand delivered to the appropriate state regulatory agencies which allows t rowe price to determine immediately whether the state had any issues accepting the documents rather than mailing documents to massachusetts regulatory agencies or relying upon outside vendors to do so which takes far more time and expense over the longer term t rowe price believes that the reorganizations will also result in potential cost savings for t rowe price the t rowe price funds and their shareholders for example issues arising under state law could be vetted with one outside law firm specializing in maryland law rather than two separate outside experts currently needed to vet issues under both maryland and massachusetts law since there are a smaller number of t rowe price funds domiciled in massachusetts splitting those costs the funds could potentially bear a larger cost than if they were domiciled in maryland and splitting those costs with the rest of the t rowe price funds in addition if the reorganizations are approved it would no longer be necessary to pay fees to an outside vendor to file documents with state regulators on behalf of the funds o   more legal certainty  the comprehensive body of law in maryland may reduce legal uncertainty and risk and provide the funds directors and management with greater certainty and predictability in managing fund affairs for example maryland law provides comparatively greater certainty with regard to limiting the liability of shareholders for obligations of a fund or its directors o   opportunity to modernize governing instruments  the trusts organizational documents were all written more than  years ago and as a result their governing instruments do not reflect the current governing framework available to mutual funds registered under the investment company act of  as amended the  page  act the reorganizations will have the benefit of eliminating any outdated provisions and adding more modern provisions that could benefit fund shareholders by increasing flexibility of operations and governance for example  the form of maryland charters that would apply if the reorganizations are approved attached hereto in appendix c provide more flexibility in how a shareholder vote may be obtained because they permit multiple funds organized under one corporation to vote together in certain instances whereas the current trust agreements of the trusts only allow the funds to vote together if required by law  the trusts organizational documents have more stringent shareholder voting requirements for reorganizations and mergers than the current governing framework available to mutual funds  the form of maryland charters contain more modern provisions relating to the requirements for closing a fund that is a series of a corporation and  maryland law provides more flexibility to funds in litigation as a maryland corporation can be a named litigant in massachusetts on the other hand a lawsuit must be brought by the trustees as a business trust cannot bring a lawsuit directly in approving each reorganization the board also considered that the reorganization will not result in any changes to the investment objective principal investment strategies investment adviser portfolio managers b or f plans operations or service providers of the relevant fund each series of a maryland corporation each a  new fund  and collectively the new funds  and its classes if applicable will maintain the same investment portfolio and offer the same shareholder services rights and privileges as its corresponding massachusettsdomiciled fund and its classes the fees and expenses including the management fee will also remain the same thus on the effective date of the reorganization a fund shareholder would hold an interest in the applicable new fund that is equivalent to the previous interest in the existing fund lastly the board considered that there are no anticipated direct or indirect federal income tax consequences of a reorganization to any of a funds shareholders how would each reorganization be accomplished by approving the proposal you will be authorizing the reorganization of your trust and fund from a massachusetts business trust and subtrust to a maryland corporation and series thereunder on the closing date in accordance with the terms of the plan the following discussion about the plan is only a summary it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the plan a form of which is attached hereto as appendix a page  summary of the plan the plan is subject to the approval of a funds shareholders and certain other conditions a form of the plan which is summarized below is attached as appendix a to this proxy statement under the plan the reorganization of a fund will be accomplished by the transfer by the fund of all of its assets to its corresponding new fund in exchange solely for as applicable investor class advisor class i class and r class shares of beneficial interest of the new fund   new fund shares   the assumption by the new fund of all liabilities of the fund and the distribution of new fund shares to the shareholders of the corresponding fund in complete liquidation of the fund o   subject to the conditions described in the plan on the closing date a fund will distribute in complete liquidation new fund shares to each fund shareholder determined as of the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the closing date  valuation date  of the fund pro rata in proportion to such shareholders beneficial interest and in exchange for that shareholders fund shares o   the number of full and fractional shares of the relevant new fund that you will receive in the reorganization of your fund will be equal to the number of full and fractional shares of the fund you own on the closing date and will be of the same share class as the shares you own on the closing date o   subsequent to the reorganization the trusts and their subtrusts will be terminated under massachusetts law the plan may be terminated and a reorganization may be abandoned by the board at any time prior to the closing date before or after approval by the shareholders of the relevant fund if circumstances should develop that in the boards opinion make proceeding with the reorganization inadvisable the plan provides that either the trusts or the new maryland corporations may waive compliance with any of the representations or conditions made by the plan except that the trusts cannot waive the requirement to receive the opinion of counsel to the trusts on behalf of the funds substantially to the effect that each reorganization will constitute a taxfree reorganization for federal income tax purposes the plan also provides page  that either the trusts or the new maryland corporations may amend the plan for the benefit of either the trusts or the new maryland corporations provided however that following the approval of the plan by each funds shareholders no such amendment may have the effect of changing the provisions for determining the number of new fund shares to be distributed to the corresponding funds shareholders under the plan to the detriment of fund shareholders without their further approval matters on which the new funds will vote pursuant to the  act certain matters must be approved by shareholders of a new mutual fund each new fund is technically a newly organized fund under state and federal law to accomplish these approvals the plan provides that t rowe price as sole initial shareholder of each new fund will approve each of the following matters prior to the closing of the relevant reorganization thus by approving the proposal shareholders of each fund will be authorizing the approval of these matters o   elect the board of directors of each new maryland corporation which will consist of the same members of each trusts board on the closing date o   ratify the selection of the new maryland corporations independent auditor pricewaterhousecoopers llp on behalf of each series thereunder which is currently the trusts independent auditor on the closing date o   approve the investment advisory agreements for each new fund which will be in substantially the same form as the investment advisory agreements in effect with respect to the funds immediately prior to the closing date o   for t rowe price capital appreciation fund t rowe price equity income fund and t rowe price new america growth fund approve the b plan for each corresponding new fund which will be in substantially the same form as the b plan in effect with respect to each fund immediately prior to the closing date and o   approve any other matter for which shareholder approval is required page  the main operating agreements of the maryland corporations and new funds will be in substantially the same form as those of the trusts and funds immediately prior to the closing date what effect will a reorganization have on shareholders as a result of a reorganization shareholders of a fund will become shareholders of the corresponding new fund immediately after the reorganization shareholders of the fund will own shares of the corresponding new fund and class if applicable that are equal in number and in value to the shares of the fund that were held by those shareholders immediately prior to the closing date each reorganization will not result in any change in the principal investment strategies investment adviser portfolio managers or service providers of the relevant fund each new fund will have the same investment objective and fundamental investment policies as its corresponding fund and will operate pursuant to a substantially similar investment advisory agreement each new fund will offer the same shareholder services as its corresponding fund the f plan for each corresponding new fund that is offered in multiple share classes will be in substantially the same form as the f plan in effect with respect to each fund immediately prior to the closing date the fees and expenses of the new fund will also be the same as the successors to a trusts operations a maryland corporation will adopt and succeed to the registration statements of each corresponding trusts under the federal securities laws and amend the registration statements as necessary to reflect the effect of the reorganizations and any additional information necessary to comply with rule  under the securities act of  as amended the   act   tax consequences prior to the closing of the reorganizations the trusts and the maryland corporations must have received the opinion of counsel to the trusts on behalf of the funds substantially to the effect that the transactions contemplated by the plan with respect to each reorganization will constitute a taxfree reorganization for federal income tax purposes for purposes of rendering its opinion counsel may rely exclusively as to factual matters on the statements made in the plan this proxy statement and on other written representations from the trusts because it is page  anticipated that each reorganization will constitute a taxfree reorganization it is also anticipated that shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss in connection with the reorganization the foregoing is a general discussion and relates only to federal income tax consequences shareholders should consult their tax advisers regarding the effect of a reorganization that may result from their individual circumstances as well as to the foreign state local and other tax consequences of the reorganization because the reorganizations will not affect any funds name investment objective or strategies a fund currently investing at least  of assets in securities whose income is exempt from a particular states income taxes will continue to invest in such securities in accordance with the same investment policy who is bearing the expenses related to the reorganizations each fund and its respective classes will bear its proportionate share of the overall cost of the reorganizations based on each class relative net assets how do the governing documents and the laws governing the funds and the new funds compare after the applicable reorganization each fund will be a series of a maryland corporation governed by the maryland general corporation law  mgcl  and such maryland corporations charter and bylaws the mgcl is similar in some respects to the laws governing each funds current structure a massachusetts business trust but they differ in certain respects a massachusetts business trust and the rights and obligations of its officers trustees and shareholders are governed by the contractual provisions included in its declaration of trust chapter  of the massachusetts general laws applies to business trusts however this statute merely sets forth the procedural or filing obligations of such trusts not the substantive requirements to which business trusts must conform both the massachusetts business trust law and the mgcl permit a funds governing documents to contain provisions relating to shareholder rights and removal of trusteesdirectors and provide a fund with the ability to amend or restate the funds governing documents however massachusetts law is silent on many of the salient features of a massachusetts business trust whereas the mgcl provides guidance and offers a significant amount of operational flexibility to maryland corporations the mgcl provides that the stockholders of a maryland page  corporation generally are not personally liable for obligations of the corporation under massachusetts law shareholders are potentially liable for business trust obligations although the trusts declarations of trust contain an express disclaimer of liability of shareholders certain massachusetts judicial decisions have determined that shareholders of a massachusetts business trust may in certain circumstances be assessed or held personally liable as partners for the obligations of a massachusetts business trust therefore the funds believe that shareholders may benefit from the express statutory protections for stockholders of a maryland corporation the funds believe that the guidance and flexibility afforded by the mgcl will benefit the funds and their shareholders the governing documents of the funds after the reorganizations will be similar in most respects to their current governing documents but will contain certain differences a comparison between the massachusetts business trust law and the mgcl and the current and proposed governing documents of the funds is attached hereto as appendix b in general these changes to a funds governing documents are intended to benefit shareholders by streamlining the administration and operation of the fund please note that appendix b contains only a summary of the characteristics of the trusts and the maryland corporations their relevant governance documents and applicable state law and is not a complete description of the documents and laws cited shareholders should refer to the provisions of those documents and the applicable law for more details a form of the articles of incorporation and bylaws for the maryland corporations are included in appendices c and d respectively the articles of incorporation and bylaws have already been filed with the maryland department of assessments and taxation to establish each new corporation however for convenience the appendices include only the standard articles of incorporation and bylaws applicable to t rowe price funds organized as maryland corporations the actual articles of incorporation and bylaws specific to each new corporation differ from these appendices only with respect to the corporation and fund names further information about voting and the shareholder meeting what is the required vote and when is the change effective each reorganization must be approved by the shareholders of the applicable fund with each fund voting separately on its reorganization page  approval of the proposal for each fund requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities as defined in the  act of that fund which means the lesser of a  or more of the voting securities present at the meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the fund are present or represented by proxy or b more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the fund if the proposed reorganization for a particular fund is approved by shareholders it is expected that the fund will change its domicile from massachusetts to maryland on or about september   this change in domicile will apply to all share classes of a fund if any of the funds introduce a new share class after the record date and mailing of this proxy statement but prior to the shareholder meeting those share classes will automatically be included as part of the reorganization in the event that the shareholders of one or more funds ultimately do not approve the proposal with respect to their fund those funds will not be reorganized and will remain subtrusts of the existing massachusetts business trust only the funds whose shareholders approve the reorganization of their fund will be reorganized what is the required quorum and under what circumstances will the meeting be adjourned a quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid shareholder meeting of each of the funds under the governing documents of the trusts the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of each fund entitled to vote at the meeting present in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at the meeting if a quorum is not present at the meeting it may be adjourned with the vote of the majority of the votes present or represented by proxy to allow additional solicitations of proxies in order to attain a quorum the shareholders present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting will also have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time if a quorum is present but the vote required to approve or reject the proposal is not obtained proxies in favor of the proposal and abstentions and broker nonvotes as defined below will be voted for adjournment provided the persons named as proxies determine that such an adjournment and additional solicitation is reasonable and in the interest of shareholders page  how are the votes counted the individuals named as proxies or their substitutes on the enclosed proxy card will vote according to your directions if your proxy is received properly executed or in accordance with your instructions given when voting by telephone or internet you may direct the proxy holders to vote your shares on the proposal by choosing for or against or abstain alternatively you may simply sign date and return your proxy cards with no specific instructions as to the proposal if you properly execute your proxy card or submit your vote via the telephone or internet and give no voting instructions your shares will be voted for the proposal abstentions and broker nonvotes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for purposes of convening the meeting although we do not anticipate any broker nonvotes  broker nonvotes  are shares held by a broker or nominee for which an executed proxy is received by a fund but are not voted as to one or more proposals because instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power because the proposal must be approved by a majority of a funds outstanding shares as defined in the  act abstentions and broker nonvotes will be considered to be voting securities that are present and will have the effect of being counted as votes against the proposal for shares of a fund held in an individual retirement account or education savings account that is sponsored by t rowe price trust company and for which t rowe price trust company serves as custodian t rowe price trust company shall without written direction from the investor vote shares for which no voting instructions are timely received in the same proportion as shares for which voting instructions from other shareholders are timely received shares of the funds that are held by another t rowe price fund will be voted by the investing t rowe price fund in the same proportion as shares for which voting instructions from other shareholders are timely received can additional matters be acted upon at the meeting t rowe price and the board know of no other business that may come before the meeting however if any additional matters are properly presented at the meeting it is intended that the persons named in the enclosed proxy or their substitutes will vote on such matters in accordance with their judgment page  are the trusts required to hold annual meetings under massachusetts law and the trusts governing documents the trusts are not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders the board has determined that the trusts will take advantage of this provision to avoid the significant expenses associated with holding an annual meeting of shareholders including legal accounting printing and mailing fees incurred in preparing proxy materials accordingly no annual meeting of shareholders shall be held in any year in which a meeting is not otherwise required to be held under the  act or massachusetts law unless the board determines otherwise however special meetings of shareholders will be held in accordance with applicable law or when otherwise determined by the board if a shareholder wishes to present a proposal to be included in a proxy statement for a subsequent shareholder meeting the proposal must be submitted in writing and received by darrell braman secretary of the t rowe price funds  east pratt street baltimore maryland  within a reasonable time before a fund begins to print and mail its proxy materials the timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee its consideration at the meeting how are proxies delivered and votes recorded this proxy statement was mailed along with a proxy voting card and prepaid envelope you may

to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those shareholders this process which is commonly referred to as householding could result in extra convenience and cost savings for a fund and its shareholders unless a fund has received contrary instructions only one

with the printing preparing assembling mailing and transmitting of proxy materials on behalf of the funds tabulating those votes that are received and any solicitation of additional votes while the fees received by computershare will vary based on the level of additional solicitation necessary to achieve quorum and shareholder approval the costs paid to computershare on behalf of the funds are estimated to be approximately  million in addition to the fees paid to computershare securities brokers custodians fiduciaries and other persons holding shares as nominees will be reimbursed upon request for their reasonable expenses in sending solicitation materials to the principals of the accounts all costs of the shareholder meetings and the proxy campaign including the use of computershare and the reimbursement to brokers for solicitation and the preparation of proxy materials will be paid for by each fund in proportion to its relative asset size at the closing date
