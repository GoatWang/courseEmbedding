would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones another good question to ask yourself or one of the several qualified agents lifeplanscom can connect you with is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you unlike a term policy which as its name suggests

beneficiaries upon your passing but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashedout anytime essentially permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term
