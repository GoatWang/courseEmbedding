story from truman to kennedyby barrett david mdb hardeman prize from its inception more than half a century ago and for decades afterward the central intelligence agency was deeply shrouded in secrecy with little or no real oversight by congressor so many americans believe david m barrett reveals however that during the agencys first fifteen years congress often monitored the cias actions and plans sometimes aggressively drawing on a wealth of newly declassified documents research at some two dozen archives and interviews with former officials barrett provides an unprecedented and often colorful account of relations between american spymasters and capitol hill he chronicles the cias dealings with senior legislators who were haunted by memories of our intelligence failure at pearl harbor and yet riddled with fears that such an organization might morph into an american gestapo he focuses in particular on the efforts of congress to monitor finance and control the agencys activities from the creation of the national security state in  through the planning for the illfated bay of pigs invasion in  along the way barrett highlights how congress criticized the agency for failing to predict the first soviet atomic test the startling appearance of sputnik over american air space and the overthrow of iraqs proamerican government in  he also explores how congress viewed the cias handling of senator mccarthys charges of communist infiltration the crisis created by the downing of a u spy plane and president eisenhowers complaint that congress meddled too much in cia matters ironically as barrett shows congress itself often pushed the agency to expand its covert operations against other nations the cia and congress provides a muchneeded historical perspective for current debates in congress and beyond concerning the agencys recent failures and ultimate fate in our post era it shows that anxieties over the challenges to democracy posed by our intelligence communities have been with us from the very beginningth century congress intelligencecondition newhpb condition ratingsnew item is brand new unused and unmarked in flawless conditionfinelike new f no defects little usage
