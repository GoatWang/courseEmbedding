the benton park west neighborhood “being a missional leader within the church is a new concept” said urban mission center director sara johnson “it basically means instead of placing focus on bringing people into the physical walls of your church you’re going out into the community serving your community getting to know your neighbors and making an impact that way it’s a handson neighborhood transformation in the context of christiam community not just transforming the neighborhood but its residents as well the salvation army will be putting this into practice with the new urban mission

open conversation about what is working and not working in urban st louis communities the urban mission center plans to host similar monthly meetings and will welcome additional guest speakers “we all
