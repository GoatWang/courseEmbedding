vermont usa on february   moved to grand detour illinois in  to escape bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo iowa deere  company continued to sell

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor

issuesubscribefollow usadvertisementadvertisement how to design the perfect productstart with craig vogel and jonathan cagan integrate style and technology with a dash of fantasy apply to everything from toasters to cars by keith h hammondslong reada visit to craig vogel’s cluttered office at carnegie mellon university is a journey to the intersection of creative destruction and american consumerism his shelves are a graveyard a loving anthology and a shrine to the good the great and the truly idiotic here’s that indestructible metal toaster you used when you were a kid a few black rotary telephones — the kind that ma bell used to make there are radios coffeemakers blenders and there are potato peelers — lots of potato peelers more on those lateradvertisementvogel is a professor of design with jonathan cagan a mechanicalengineering professor at the university he teaches a course in product development the two academics research and consult on the subject of new product design for such companies as ford motor motorola and whirlpool this is what they’ve learned so far companies don’t do a very good job of developing new productsthe issue engineers are from mars designers are from venus engineers tend to obsess over the details of getting products to work — but they’re uncomfortable with the critical questions that have to be answered before a new product ever gets to manufacturing who will buy it what value will it add designers revel in those sloppier issues but they tend to cower when confronted with problems related to craftsmanship durability and reliability that results in product after product that fails on one dimension or the other — or worse yet bothin their book creating breakthrough products innovation from product planning to program approval prentice hall  vogel and cagan advocate an integrated approach to product design innovative new products the authors argue come from mastering the “fuzzy front end” they happen when a company delivers on both style and technology in a way that can provide some measure of fantasysurrounded by coke cans from eras past toasters and the occasional potato peeler vogel and cagan spoke with fast company about inventing and delivering successful new productsmanaging the fuzzy front enddesign problem merge style with technology the  sears coldspot developed with designer raymond loewy was a bold leap forward for the lowly refrigerator loewy gave the clunky cold box a clean new look wrapping the cooling unit with sheet metal he made it easy for owners to open the door even when their arms were filled with groceries and he replaced the metal shelves inside with aluminum to prevent rusting this was an early example of the integration of style and technology — and sales soaredcagan the “fuzzy front end” is a term we heard used a lot in the industry it’s a very early stage of product development when you’re really not sure what you’re designing yet you’re trying to figure out what your opportunity is — and to assess the whole context for that opportunityadvertisementvogel many people especially engineers are uncomfortable with the fuzzy front end they see getting through it as something you do on the way to a place where you can measure things more effectively but our message is you absolutely have to treat that part of the process well the coldspot was a very early example of what happens when a company spends enough time on the front end — and the result was effective sears and loewy answered the question how do you bring this monster machine from the back porch into the kitchen they saw the opportunitycagan a lot of companies just worry about getting the product out they figure let’s not worry about this early stuff we’ll focus on manufacturing and we’ll get it to work at the end so they either create beautifully made products that no one wants or they miss all of their deadlines because they’re trying to catch up at the end we found that by investing time in the fuzzy front end you can accelerate the development processform and function fulfill … fantasydesign problem make an impersonal machine into a personal tool the wave from crown equipment corp isn’t your father’s forklift after reviewing industry trends and witnessing the difficulties that warehouse employees had when using rolling ladders to get parts crown developed an entirely different product the wave extended crown’s core technical capabilities with less scale and weight it was safer quicker and easier to controlvogel the traditional definition of value has been to produce the most number of units for the lowest price while getting them into the hands of the most people but what people value and the way that they interact with a product goes beyond price the visual form the way that they handle it and how it makes them feel are all part of the value statementcagan we have tried to create a way for companies to understand their target markets by identifying value opportunities by really thinking about where the market is at and where you want to go you can understand the opportunities — and then you create product goals that’s how you help define productvogel we’ve gone from the concept of mass value where you can have a huge welldefined market to a world where value is subdivided and defined in more discrete ways people still have shared values at one level but they also bring very discrete values that they want from a product so a consumer who wants a subaru outback is much different from one who wants a mercedes suv — even though they both want an allweather fourwheeldrive vehicleadvertisementcagan value is all about fulfilling fantasy for engineers their driving statement traditionally has been the concept that form follows function for designers it’s usually the opposite but you need both your goal is to create a great experience — the fantasy — for the customerfantasy doesn’t have to be exotic you could be working in a warehouse in a partspick job you’re running around in sneakers on a rolling ladder and you’re mad at the world and it’s a terrible job wouldn’t it be great if you had more control and more power the crown wave is a great example of fulfilling that fantasy it’s small and fun to use it empowers people although it’s more expensive than a rolling ladder workers become more efficient and they stay in their jobs longer because they’re happierscaling the “sheer cliff of value”design problem find the beauty in a potato peeler sam farber already a successful entrepreneur sensed an opportunity in the housewares industry after watching his wife an arthritis sufferer struggle with existing kitchen tools farber’s insight introduced utensils that weren’t just comfortable to use but that also set a new aesthetic standardvogel here’s a generic potato peeler the same one people have used for a century you have sheet metal wrapped around a form to give it a basic shape with a center line running through it that both locks the handle together and integrates the blade into the handle this is about the cheapest way to deliver on a form that has both a blade and a handle it’s dictated more by manufacturing than by the function of its usenow look at farber’s version oxo’s good grips swivel peeler there’s a broad santoprene handle that makes it easy to grip the flexible fins make the handle appear lighter and add comfort and the curved blade shield echoes the shape of the handle this potato peeler was built from the customer backward rather than from the manufacturer forward part of the fantasy here is i have arthritis and i can’t use a standard peeler but i have an alternative with oxo’s versioncagan it also elevates potato peeling to an aesthetic statement of who we are now everyone can own a contemporary product that looks beautiful and has a sort of richness it takes a mundane task and makes it more enjoyable you can even hang it up the upshot is there’s value in that fantasy the oxo potato peeler costs about  which is five times the price of the generic version but it doesn’t cost that much more to makeadvertisementvogel we think of product design in terms of a twobytwo matrix one axis is style and the other is technology the generic potato peeler falls into the lower left of the map it’s functional but it has very little style or defining technology great valuedriven products such as the oxo peeler move into the upper rightcagan you can’t just throw an engineer and a designer together and say create something in the upper right there has to be a commitment to do the proper research and you have to understand the needs and desires of your target market you have to understand what the opportunity gap is by scanning the social and technology factors and then understand what that gap means — so that when you create a new product you’re bridging that gap you have to do something significant to get into the upper right that’s why we call it the “sheer cliff of value”vogel to scale that cliff you also have to commit yourself to a comprehensive way of working in the fuzzy front end there is a lot of trial and error and you have to be ready for the fact that there are going to be a lot of misses you need to have people thinking across disciplines and thinking about innovation what we’ve seen is that it takes a different sort of commitment to do thatnow let’s look at the rotato potato peeler which falls into the lowerright quadrant it is a technically driven peeler the latest incarnation of the frightening thcentury mechanical peelers with exposed bladescagan as seen on tvvogel companies often try to improve on the generic product simply by adding new technology add more gadgets and make it spin electrify it or handpower it the rotato supposedly reduces the amount of labor — but it also takes off at least an eighth of the vegetableadvertisementcagan plus the rotato is cumbersome to use and it’s ugly you don’t really get very much lifestyle impactvogel but the american ethic says if you add more technology it’s always better if you add a power train or a turbo boost you’ve automatically improved itcagan the rotato has an electric armvogel applying technology to everything isn’t always the best solution and that’s what’s proven if you see the rotato you might be captivated my daughter loves it she wants one of these but it doesn’t create lasting valuecagan that’s not to say you can’t have a hightech product in the upper right — but the technology should match up with the application the apple imac is a good example while most personal computers come with lots of features and aren’t that easy to use the imac has taken an alternative approach which is virtually the opposite it comes with a zen philosophy let’s be minimalist and give people what they need — and only thatstaying in the upper rightdesign problem create new value from an old standard a black  decker engineer happened upon the opportunity in his own workshop he needed a handsfree rechargeable task light that was flexible and could wrap around objects the snakelight debuted in  supported by heavy tv advertising at the time black  decker projected sales of  units in the first year it sold over  in fact it took  months to catch up with demandadvertisementcagan to stay in the upper right you have to keep injecting useful usable and desirable features take the latest oxo peeler it still has a good grip but this updated version integrates brushed steel which is a more contemporary lookvogel in certain markets the upperright quadrant has been less sustainable than others but the oxo swivel peeler has been remarkably sustainableconsider motorola’s talkabout twoway radio this was a great upperright product but it was instantly challenged by companies that were in the walkietalkie industry and that were wired to compete they started producing cheaper knockoffs motorola had been making huge profits as a result of the talkabout and it had to lower prices very quickly to stay competitivecagan here’s another example look at the snakelight black  decker did a great job with patents but it didn’t continue to inject useful usable and desirable changes into the product it dominated the market for four years — but eventually it lost market sharevogel it wasn’t that the competition was so great here’s one knockoff the pretzl lite which is so bad it’s not even in the upper left it doesn’t work well it looks terrible but it managed to disguise its problems when you see the pretzl lite in its package you don’t realize all that the pretzl lite successfully drafted off of the snakelight’s success so even though the knockoffs were sued successfully they created a lowerend market segment where people decided that they didn’t have to pay as much as a result when the knockoffs didn’t work it hurt the credibility of the snakelight and then black  decker didn’t add any features after four years everyone who wanted one already had onekeith h hammonds khammondsfastcompanycom is a fast company senior editor based in new york for more articles on design as a strategic weapon click hereadvertisementsidebar

february   moved to grand detour illinois in  to escape bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year

a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor since entering the tractor business in  john deere had

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo iowa deere  company continued to sell tractors under the waterloo boy name until  when the john deere model d was introduced the company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in waterloo iowa namely the r r and r series the company produced its first combine harvester the john deere no  in  a year

respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor since entering the tractor business in  john deere had focused on twocylinder machines the new generation of power introduced at deere day in dallas was very different from anything deere had built before the new line of four and sixcylinder tractors the models    and  were more far more powerful than deeres twocylinder models and also easier and more comfortable to operate with conveniently located controls better visibility and improved seat suspension these new tractors were also easier to service the

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which

circulation continued to increase and at the current time hovers around  the magazine now generally contains  fullcolor pages and is perfect bound it is now printed in michigan and mailed from several different post offices throughout the country current content usually includes a tip of the month article covering new generation restoration written by dan brotzman a youngtimer article written by

again harriet hall on november   share thistweetshare on tumblrmorepocketprintemail “telomeres shorten each time a cell divides in most cells the telomeres eventually reach a critical length when the cells stop proliferating and become senescent but in certain cells like sperm and egg cells the enzyme telomerase restores telomeres to the ends of chromosomes this telomere lengthening insures that the cells can continue to safely divide and multiply investigators have shown that telomerase is activated in most immortal cancer cells since telomeres do not shorten when cancer cells divide” — national institute of aging new health products are constantly appearing on the market in such numbers that i can’t hope to keep up product b was new to me i was introduced to it by a doctor who said a family member was “quite enthusiastic” about its potential to “lengthen telomeres and thereby address a myriad of health issues” of course i immediately asked “what exactly are they claiming product b does” and “do they have evidence that it actually does what they claim” their website didn’t provide satisfactory answers product b is described as “a powerful blend of complex botanicals and vitamins uniquely designed to offer superior telomere support for youthful aging” it is sold as part of a multilevel marketing mlm scheme because it is classified as a dietary supplement fda regulations only allow them to make “structure and function” claims so the claims are deliberately nebulous basically they seem to be saying that short telomeres are bad they cause aging and disease telomerase is good because it makes telomeres longer and product b is an effective way to increase telomerase therefore product b prevents disease and retards aging but these assertions are questionable and the website doesn’t offer any credible evidence of clinical efficacy for any single health issue much less a myriad of them or any evidence of safety for that matter oh good grief it’s sold by the isagenix company talk about déjà vu isagenix keeps coming back to haunt me it even generated my favorite insult ever “dr harriet hall is a refrigerator with a head” you can read the three articles i wrote about isagenix here here and here if i am a refrigerator at least i try to be a fair one i wasn’t going to reject the claims out of hand just because isagenix made them i spent quite a bit of time searching the internet for information and i even wrote the company to ask directly for their evidence they didn’t bother to reply one thing puzzled me right off the bat was there a product a that i had somehow missed why did they name this “product b” that doesn’t impress me as a savvy marketing choice couldn’t they have thought up something catchier like “telomiracle” i couldn’t help wondering what the b might stand for and my mind quickly associated the words bogus blarney business baloney bunk bullshit blunder basura spanish for garbage barbaridad spanish for stupid thing and blague french for joke it made me think of second choice as in “plan b” what does it make you think of pardon the digression it makes no difference what they call it “a rose by any other name…” all that matters is what it is and whether it works what’s a telomere every chromosome has a telomere a repeated sequence of nucleotides at the end of the dna strand it is a disposable section that carries no genetic information for vertebrates the nucleotide sequence is ttaggg this repeats from  to several thousand times according to the species of animal telomeres are sort of like the aglet that little hard piece on the end of a shoelace that keeps it from unraveling they protect the end of the chromosome and keep it from losing important genes or sticking to other chromosomes when cells divide each strand of dna is copied the enzymes that carry out that job don’t actually make a perfectly identical copy when they get to the end of the dna strand they are unable to copy all the way to the very last nucleotide so every time a cell divides the dna is shortened some of those ttaggg’s are lost when enough of them are lost the cell is kaput the hayflick limit is the number of times a cell can divide before it becomes incapable of dividing further typically  times for human cells in cell culture in the lab if your cells stop dividing you die telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that has its own rna it serves as a template to make more ttaggg sequences and add them to the telomere reversing the usual shortening process telomerase is active in cells that can’t afford to stop dividing embryonic cells the testicular cells that produce sperm and stem cells but it is not found in most adult body cells so the hypothesis is that if you could make the telomerase gene express itself in somatic cells the telomeres might not shorten with age the hayflick limit might be overridden the aging process might be stopped in its tracks and we might overcome natural death and become immortal so far this hypothesis is only a dream telomerase is not always a good thing there’s a downside encouraging telomerase might be dangerous cancer is characterized by unregulated growth and telomerase is active in  of human malignancies we don’t want cancer cells to live forever drugs that reduce telomerase activity are being investigated as cancer treatments so if product b really increases telomerase activity that might not be such a good thing we might fall from the frying pan of the aging process into the fire of more cancers the role of telomerase in aging is still controversial short telomeres could be just a sign of cellular age rather than a cause in at least one species of seabird they are neither telomeres become longer with age the product b website says “almost every known disease can be attributed to the shortening of telomeres” that is demonstrably false well maybe they “can be attributed” by someone who is willing to make false attributions but there is no evidence that short telomeres actually “do” cause almost every known disease in fact it has not been conclusively established that they cause any disease there are correlations but science is still trying to tease out causation questionable information the website doesn’t provide much in the way of scientific evidence but it provides the usual testimonials and a couple of slick video presentations aging is a complex subject not well understood by science and the science of telomeres is still in its infancy they grossly oversimplify and misrepresent the science with sound bites like “we age because our cells age and our telomeres get shorter” they say we are born with  telomere bases and when we get down to  bases we begin to die of old age no it’s not that simple the videos feature william h andrews “a worldleading researcher on telomeres” they call him “the principal discoverer of rna and protein components of telomerase” i was unable to verify that he is not listed as one of the authors of this study that identified the protein composition of human telomerase elsewhere on the web i learned that andrews started out trying to develop a pharmaceutical drug that would activate the telomerase gene he tested thousands of compounds in vitro some of them worked but were toxic after his research funding dried up he met john anderson a “nutritionist” with decades of experience in formulating nutritional products anderson persuaded him to stop trying to develop a pharmaceutical drug to just bypass the fda and market a diet supplement instead together they formulated a diet supplement product and accumulated lots of testimonials about more energy sounder sleep feeling younger etc andrews says i have never seen so many anecdotal testimonies for any product ever he has obviously led a sheltered life i am a pharmaceutical scientist by training i believe in double blind placebo controlled studies i believe that placebo effects occur but i have just never seen this many testimonials before i strongly believe something is happening but i am not going to make any claims until the clinical studies are done sound familiar maybe he’s not making any claims but the isagenix company is certainly managing to get the product b message across to its customers despite the required fda disclaimer i’d bet that most of their customers believe they are buying a product that will lengthen their telomeres retard aging give them lots of energy and make them feel and look younger what’s in product b you can read the list of ingredients here basically it’s a mixture of four vitamins with a proprietary blend of some  herbal products such as thistle horny goat weed ginseng and green tea most of these have never been shown to have any effect on telomerase this  review article covered “pharmaceutical regulation of telomerase and its clinical potential” they report that a commercially developed telomerase activator molecule tat derived from the root of astragalus membranaceous has been found to transiently activate telomerase in the lab in t lymphocytes that were not proliferating they say it “could” prove useful but “more work needs to be done to determine mechanism of action and safety” neither tat nor astragalus are ingredients of product b in table  of that review they list all the phytochemicals that are known to regulate telomerase there are only  known telomerase activators and  known inhibitors several of the inhibitors are among the ingredients of product b which is being sold to activate telomerase something doesn’t add up i can’t see any rationale for the particular kitchen sink of ingredients in product b it seems like they just threw in a little of everything anyone had ever suggested might be good for you the review concludes pharmaceutically inhibiting telomerase may prove an important option in cancer therapy in conjunction with traditional chemotherapeutics conversely the activation of telomerase could be useful to treat age related diseases and hivaids patients where lymphocytes have stopped proliferating however the longterm effects of regulating telomerase either positively or negatively are unclear william andrews was one of the authors of this study that tested the astragalus derivative tat as part of a complex dietary supplement protocol it activated telomerase in vitro and in vivo it produced a decline in senescent toxic t cells and killer cells mainly in subjects who were seropositive for cytomegalovirus cmv mean telomere length did not increase but they interpreted the results as positive because there was a reduction in the percentage of short telomeres this was an uncontrolled pilot study by researchers who had a declared financial interest in the product and it gives us no useful information about clinical benefits william andrews was one of the authors and he also served as a subject the financial disclosure statement reports that he is founder and president of a company that develops therapeutics for inducing telomerase expression and that the study was partly financed by his company a single study of product b but tat is not in product b i found only one study that actually tested product b it was a randomized placebocontrolled double blind study but was small only  subjects and was presented at a conference but has not yet been accepted for publication in a peerreviewed journal it found that product b increased catalase activity by  in red blood cells that doesn’t tell us much why did they measure catalase instead of telomerase levels or telomere length one of the authors explained “there is yet to be a direct measure of telomeres that is reliable enough for an accurate measurement of telomere length for obtaining statistical significance in a clinical trial” that sounds to me like a poor excuse it can’t be that difficult to measure telomere length since so many studies have done it after all that’s how we learned that telomeres shorten with age and i know there is an accurate method to measure telomerase the trap method telomeric repeat amplification protocol that most researchers accept and that has been used in many other studies isagenix is not the only company selling products targeted at telomeres “america’s number one antiaging pioneer” dr al sears sells ultraessence described as a “reliable telomere support supplement” and the geron company sells imetelstat to inhibit telomerase and treat cancer conclusion there are lots of proposed antiaging remedies and there are even longevity clinics but as far as i know no treatment has yet been proven to slow the aging process or extend the human lifespan there are only preventive measures to reduce the risk of premature death and to improve the likelihood of staying healthy while you age exercise weight control smoking cessation vaccines screening tests seatbelts treating high blood pressure etc i wouldn’t go so far as to call product b a scam but it certainly is not supported by good scientific evidence it is based on bold extrapolations from basic research along with speculation unwarranted assumptions and wishful thinking there are lots of products out there with similarly unproven claims for instance protandim which i wrote about here here and here my plan a remain skeptical of product b and wait for evidence e     share
