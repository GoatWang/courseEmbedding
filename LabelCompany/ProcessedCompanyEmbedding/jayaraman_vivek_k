sufficiency in the world for man’s need but not for man’s greed” mahatma gandhi pattinathar the saint said you don’t even take a broken needle on the way to cemetery but none of these wise words penetrate the conscience of human society the evil effect of corruption on society is pointed out by the supreme court in the case of state of maharashtra trcbi vs balakrishna dattatrya kumbhar “corruption is not only a punishable offence but also undermines human rights indirectly violating them and systematic corruption is a human rights’ violation in itself as it leads to systematic economic crimes” justice tcunha who sentenced jayalalitha to four years imprisonment observed in his judgment …  “a is occupying a high position in the government of state of tamil nadu it is often observed “just as those at high places behave so others below” if persons holding higher positions indulge in corruption not only those below get encouraged to indulge in corruption but also the person holding higher position will not be in a position to exact honesty from them or to take action against delinquent officials” the admk slaves who were so confident that their all powerful ‘amma the invincible’ would come out unscathing were in for a deep shock  slowly coming out of the shock their only argument is karunanidhi honest  it is true karunanidhi and dmk are corrupt   but what prevented jayalalitha from launching corruption cases and taking them to its logical conclusion both during her tenure in  and    the reason jayalalitha failed to install special courts and successfully prosecuting them is not only that she is fighting a battery of corruption cases on her own but due to the fact that jayalalitha’s only intention now and forever is loot loot and loot though the dmk and the admk arise from the same toxic stew there is a mild difference between them when the dmk is in power factories are established roads are laid lakes and ponds are cleaned new development plans are created from such activities karunanidhi’s various families get commission if the government spends  rupees  will reach the public but in jayalalitha’s administration it is nothing but a colossal failure   take her present tenure as an example    in the past three years of jaya rule not even a single project has taken of in tamil nadu   except the humongous growth of tasmac the state’s liquour outlet nothing has ever grown   the administration has seen nothing but frequent shuffle in the ministry and bureaucracy    for such an impotent administration there are numerous ministers secretaries police officers etc it is really a very sorry state of affairs that a politician who stands convicted by a trial court for corruption charges after a prolonged  years and who is out on bail is still running the administration in tamil nadu  senior bureaucrats without shame bow before this convict and get instructions people who are in the know of things have a wide variety of tales about this government  the modus operandi adopted by amma for collection is thus  every minister depending on his portfolio is fixed a weekly target   they have to collect their target and handover the same in a specified bungalow in chennai’s east coast road    the entire collection amounts should be in new currencies and the serial number of the first and the last note should be mentioned in a slip and placed on top of the bundle   the respective ministers would get  of the total collection and the share should only be collected after paying the amount in total and not before   later the money is transferred to several auditors who in turn would launder the money through hawala routes let us take one area where jayalalitha rakes in the moolah  the tamil nadu government purchases about  mw of power from private power manufacturers every day  the cost of a unit ranges between rs to rs   the grapevine has it that the power minister natham r viswanathan gets  paise per unit as commission and the tangedco chairman gnanadesikan ias gets  paise per unit for such power purchases   on a rough calculation gnanadesikan makes rs lakhs per day and natham makes  crore a day   of course jayalalitha will get a lion’s share from this to cite another example we can take the case of tasmac  anyone who passes through a tasmac outlet can see the crowd and the thriving sales   in the recent two months the prices of imfl liquor has gone up twice  still there were news items that sales on diwali has dipped when compared to previous year  surprising   indeed barring elite shops all the tasmac outlets have a bar attached    sources say natham viswanathan has devised an innovative way to make a quick  buck   instead of tamil nadu state marketing corporation tasmac placing indents to the liquor manufacturers the distilleries will send the stocks directly to the bar and receive payment    of the tax revenue to be received by the government through this sales will straight go to natham viswanathan’s pocket   one gopi who is the brotherinlaw of natham viswanathan is taking care of this racket  this is being done only in select outlets    sources in secretariat say that the government’s finance department is on and off raising alarms about the dip in sales of tasmac for it is the only cash cow for the state one may naturally wonder what would jayalalitha and sasikala would be doing with this unimaginable quantities of money let us see judge cunha who nailed jayalalitha in the assets case mentions in his judgment that jayalalitha after coming to power in  floated several firms to launder money in the name of a sasikala a ilavarasi and a sudakaran evidences now suggest that jayalalitha has proved to be incorrigible    she has not even for a moment halted her corrupt activities one such benami firm floated by jayalalitha is a firm hot wheels engineering private limited   the firm was created on th september     it is not clear who were the first set of directors in the firm when it was created however  subsequent to sasikala’s expulsion in december  two individuals were appointed as directors  one is cho ramaswamy a noted political critic journalist lawyer actor writer moralist etc   cho is vociferous in his arguments for probity in public life etc      but time has proved that he has been cleverly maintaining a camouflage  he also was a director in the midas distilleries and breweries during this period immediately after the expulsion of sasikala and the entire group of mannargudi mafia as they are popularly known cho srinivasan ramasamy was inducted as director in several firms he has signed the annual reports of several firms as per the documents available with the registrar of companies   apart from cho ramasamy the second director in the firm is poonkundran     poonkundran’s father is a poet named sankaralingam    they belong to soorakottai in thiruvarur district   his father use to write statements for jayalalitha and write articles in namathu mgr an admk mouth piece      subsequently sankaralingam was driven out of poes garden by the bandit sisters and poonkundran replaced his father standing far right is the great entrepreneur poonkundran who is a director in several firms at present poonkundran is jayalalitha’s personal attender  his job is to open letters and place it on the jayalalitha’s table and move away signed papers      he was also a director in the hot wheels engineering private limited along with cho ramaswamy    but after the reentry of mannargudi mafia into poes garden cho ramaswamy was kicked out of all the companies the present directors of this hot wheels engineering company private limited makes a curious study    one is dr kssivakumar and the other is karthikeyan kaliyaperumal      sasikala’s elder brother sundaravadhanam has two daugthers   one is prabavathi and the other is anuradha    anuradha has married ttv dinakaran a former admk mp    and drkssivakumar is the one who married the other daughter prabavathi sasikala and ilavarasi accused no in the assets case is ilavarasi    ilavarasi is sasikala’s brother jayaraman’s wife     jayaraman died due to electric shock while working in jayalalitha’s hyderabad garden  ever since he died ilavarasi and his kids are squatting in poes garden     ilavarasi has two daughters and a son   one is shakeela jayaraman another is krishnapriya jayaraman they are married to karthikeyan and rajarajan respectively apart from this ilavarasi has a son named vivek jayaraman he currently maintains the accounts in poes garden prabavathy sivakumar couple ilavarasi’s daughters and son in july  the name of the firm hot wheels engineering was changed to jazz cinemas in an extraordinary general body meeting  let us see the background jazz cinema was originally founded by film producer patham chandh pothra and shanmugam why did the mannargudi mafia suddenly evince interest in cinema business may puzzle you the mumbai based phoneix mills entered into a joint venture and promoted a mall at velacherry in chennai  this mall was opened in january     the mall had  screens in it   though the mall was open for public in january  the  theaters inside the mall were not opened to public and were opened only in march   the reason for this unusual delay for more than one year is surprising       the city police refused to give no objection certificate citing lack of safety features     to understand the unusual delay of opening the theaters and the associated financial loss we have to look into a have to look to a meeting held at old no  new no  venkatraman street chennai tnagar  at  on the morning of  july  this meeting was the extraordinary general body meeting of hot wheels engineering it was presided over by vksasikala it is pertinent to mention that both have been found guilty in jayalalitha’s disproportionate assets case in that meeting it was decided that as the owners of hot wheels and lessees the two accused would invest in theaters video game parlors recording studios multiplexes and game arcades according to sources earlier sathyam cinemas had entered into an agreement to buy the  screens that were about to come up in phoenix malls sathyam cinemas had entered into an agreement at an early stage with the phoenix mall to buy space for the  theaters as the mall was nearing completion the mannargudi mafia headed by sasikala threatened the sathyam group to part with the ownership of the  screens   but the sathyam group who are in the movie business for decades refused to budge   an enraged sasikala directed city police commissioner sgeorge ips to bring them in line    sgeorge who is known to be subservient to his ruling masters obliged  it was george who was inoordinately delaying the issuance of noc for the commencement of theaters    even after the inordinate delay the sathyam owners had refused to budge   george adopted the perennial police trick    sathyam group director swaroop reddy and sujai anand reddy were booked in a case of land grab by the anti land grab cell of chennai city police    the hindu               times of india                       the new indian express sujai anand reddy was arrested and swaroop reddy went absconding   the writing on the wall was clear for the sathyam group  either sell or rot in jail   they gave up   this is how sasikala was able to experiment her entrepreneurial skills in movie business is it not astonishing to believe that a person who is awaiting judgment in an all important criminal case in which she is an accused would chair a board meeting to usurp a prime property    such is the audacity of greed subsequent to the sale the  screens in the phoenix mall were leased out to sathyam cinemas the temerity of the queens of booty to continue to amass illegal wealth is based on the short memory of tn public and their justified assessment about the weak opposition who don’t have any moral ground to raise corruption issue   the sorry state of the opposition parties in tamil nadu is too palpable   while on the one hand the principal opposition dmk is grappling with its own corruption charges the national party bjp is running like a headless chicken   most of the dmk ministers are facing corruption charges in various courts in tamil nadu   another opposition party pmk ‘s heir apparent anbumani ramadoss is facing two criminal cases in a delhi cbi court the left are still groping in the dark    with literally no opposition in the state there is no surprise that the queens of booty continue to loot the state impudence tags assets caseconvictionjayalalitha next story சிறை செல்லும் சீமாட்டி – பாகம்  previous story தண்ணீர் விட்டோ வளர்த்தோம் சர்வேசா… you may also

common man on what is happening in our society people should beware of these evil elements evil politicians across all parties and be careful while getting involved in big businesses coming to the parties dmk in my opinion is more development oriented than aiadmk during their last regime they initiated the chennai metro constructed the majestic tamil nadu legislature building which has been shifted now constructed the worldclass anna centenary library developed a beautiful semmozhi poonga etc… aiadmk on the other hand i think are more of populist schemes like the poorfriendly and exemplary amma unavagam with both dmk and aiadmk appearing to be corrupt i would still prefer the dmk government because they not only implement development schemes they also initiate populist schemes like rice for  re remember it was kalaignar who also won the classical language status for tamil one thing that particularly irritated me during this current regime was the kind of outrage and
