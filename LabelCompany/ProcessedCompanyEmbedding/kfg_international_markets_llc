company profile information business description history background information on kfc corporation business forum company history index food services and retailers kfc corporation  company profile information business description history background information on kfc corporation po box louisville kentucky usa history of kfc corporation kfc corporation is the largest fastfood chicken operator developer and franchiser in the world kfc a wholly owned subsidiary of pepsico inc until late  operates over  units in the united states approximately  percent of which are franchises internationally kfc has more than  units of which twothirds are also franchised in addition to direct franchising and wholly owned operations the company participates in joint ventures and continues investigating alternative venues to gain market share in the increasingly competitive fastfood market in late  the company expected to become a wholly owned subsidiary of tricon global restaurants inc to be formed from the spin off of pepsicos restaurant holdings the early life of colonel sanders kentucky fried chicken was founded by harland sanders in corbin kentucky sanders was born on a small farm in henryville indiana in  following the death of sanderss father in  sanderss mother worked two jobs to support the family the young sanders learned to cook for his younger brother and sister by age six when mrs sanders remarried her new husband didnt tolerate harland sanders left home and school when he was  years old to work as a farm hand for four dollars a month at age  he left that job to work at a variety of jobs including painter railroad fireman plowman streetcar conductor ferryboat operator insurance salesman justice of the peace and servicestation operator in  sanders opened a gas station in corbin kentucky and cooked for his family and an occasional customer in the back room sanders enjoyed cooking the food his mother had taught him to make panfried chicken country ham fresh vegetables and homemade biscuits demand for sanderss cooking rose eventually he moved across the street to a facility with a seat restaurant a motel and a gas station during the s an image that would become known throughout the world began to develop first sanders was named an honorary kentucky colonel by the states governor second he developed a unique quick method of spicing and pressurefrying chicken due to his regional popularity the harland sanders court and cafe received an endorsement by duncan hiness adventures in good eating in  sanders court and cafe was kentuckys first motel but the colonel was forced to close it when gas rationing during world war ii cut tourism reopening the motel after the war sanderss hand was once again forced in the early s planned interstate  would bypass corbin entirely though sanders cafe was valued at  the owner could only get  for it at auction just enough to pay his debts sanders first franchise in  however in  the colonel signed on his first franchise to pete harman who owned a hamburger restaurant in salt lake city utah throughout the next four years he convinced several other restaurant owners to add his kentucky fried chicken to their menus therefore rather than struggle to live on his savings and social security in  sanders incorporated and the following year took his chicken recipe to the road doing demonstrations onsite to sell his method clad in a white suit white shirt and black string tie sporting a white mustache and goatee and carrying a cane sanders dressed in a way that expressed his energy and enthusiasm in  sanders moved the business to shelbyville kentucky  miles east of louisville to more easily ship his spices pressure cookers carryout cartons and advertising material and by  sanderss recipe was franchised to more than  outlets in the united states and canada sanders had  employees and travelled more than  miles in one year promoting kentucky fried chicken he was clearing  before taxes and the business was getting too large for sanders to handle new management for kentucky fried chicken in  sanders sold kentucky fried chicken for  million and a peryear salary of  for public appearances that salary later rose to  the offer came from an investor group headed by john y brown jr a yearold graduate of the university of kentucky law school and nashville financier john jack massey a notable member of the investor group was pete harman who had been the first to purchase sanderss recipe  years earlier under the agreement brown and massey owned national and international franchise rights excluding england florida utah and montana which sanders had already apportioned sanders would also maintain ownership of the canadian franchises the company subsequently acquired the rights to operations in england canada and florida as chairman and ceo massey trained brown for the job meanwhile harland sanders enjoyed his less hectic role as roving ambassador in business week massey remarked hes the greatest pr man i have ever known within three years brown and massey had transformed the loosely knit oneman show  into a smoothly run corporation with all the trappings of modern management according to business week retail outlets reached all  states plus puerto rico mexico japan jamaica and the bahamas with  takeout stores and restaurants kentucky fried chicken ranked sixth in volume among foodservice companies it trailed such giants as howard johnson but was ahead of mcdonalds corporation and international dairy queen in  franchising remained the foundation of the business for an initial  fee a franchisee went to kfc university to learn all the basics while typical costs for a complete kentucky fried chicken startup ran close to  some franchisees had already become millionaires tying together a national image the company began developing prefabricated redandwhite striped buildings to appeal to tourists and residents in the united states the revolutionary choice massey and brown made was to change the colonels concept of a sitdown kentucky fried chicken dinner to a standup takeout store emphasizing fast service and low labor costs this idea created by   millionaires all from selling the colonels famous pressurecooked chicken but such unprecedented growth came with its cost as brown remarked in business week at one time i had  millionaires reporting to me at eight oclock every morning it could drive you crazy despite the number of vocal franchisees the corporation lacked management depth brown tried to use successful franchisees as managers but their commitment rarely lasted more than a year or two there was too much money to be made as entrepreneurs stock plummets in  several observations about franchise arrangements noted by stock market analysts and accountants in the late s became widespread news by  first wall street noticed that profits for many successful franchisers came from companyowned stores not from the independent shopsthough this was not the case with kentucky fried chicken this fact tied in with a memorandum circulated at peat marwick mitchell  company and an article published by archibald mackay in the journal of accountancy stating that income labeled initial franchise fees was added when a franchise agreement was signed regardless of whether the store ever opened or fees were collected such loose accounting practices caused a wall street reaction franchisers enjoying the reputation as glamour stocks through the s were no longer so highly regarded kentucky fried chicken stock hit a high of  in  then fell to as low as  per share within a year in early  following a number of disagreements with brown massey resigned when several other key leaders departed the company brown found the housecleaning he planned already in progress a number of food and finance specialists joined kentucky fried chicken including r c beeson as chief operational officer and joseph kesselman as chief financial officer kesselman brought in new marketing controlling and computer experts he also obtained the companys first largescale loan package  million plus a  million credit line by august  the shakeup was clear colonel harland sanders his grandson harland adams and george baker who had run company operations resigned from the board of directors colonel sanders at  knew his limits in a  new york times article sanders stated i realized that i was someplace i had no place being everything that a board of a big corporation does is over my head and im confused by the talk and high finance discussed at these meetings ceo brown spent the rough year of  shoring up his companys base of operations by september kentucky fried chicken operated a total of  fastfood outlets the company owned  of these units the company once too large for the colonel to handle grew too mammoth for john y brown as well in july  kentucky fried chicken merged with connecticutbased heublein inc a specialty food and alcoholic beverage corporation sales for kentucky fried chicken had reached  million and brown at age  left the company with a personal net worth of  million interviewed for the wall street journal regarding the companys  financial overhaul brown commented you never saw a more negative bunch if id have listened to them in the first place wed never have started kentucky fried chicken article author frederick c klein included closing parenthetical remarks in which observers close to the company noted that in engineering kentucky fried chickens explosive growth mr brown neglected to install needed financial controls and foodresearch facilities and had let relations with some franchise holders go sour heublein makes changes in s heublein planned to increase kentucky fried chickens volume with its marketing knowhow through the s the company introduced some new products to compete with other fastfood markets the popularity of barbecued spare ribs introduced in  kept the numbers for kentucky fried chicken looking better than they really were as management concentrated on overall store sales they failed to notice that the basic chicken business was slacking off competitors sales increased as kentucky fried chickens dropped for heublein acquisitions were doing more harm than good kentucky fried chicken was stumbling just when the parent company had managed to get united vintners bought in  on its feet in  the company appointed michael miles who was formerly responsible for the kentucky fried chicken ad campaign at leo burnett and had joined heubleins marketing team in  to chair the ailing kentucky fried chicken richard mayer vicepresident of marketing and strategic planning for heubleins grocery products took charge of the kentucky fried chicken us division mayer found that the product mainstay fried chicken wasnt up to the high quality colonel harland sanders would expect miles and mayer also faced the same problem john y brown had not managed to surmount relations with franchisees were sour in the mids the franchisees sold more per store than companyowned stores faring better without heubleins help they resented paying royalty fees to the ineffective corporate parent to top that off the stores were looking out of date having unloaded well over  companyowned stores in the early s by the end of the decade heublein began to buy some back from the franchisees renovation of the original redandwhite striped buildings began in earnest with heublein putting  million into the project on the outside kentucky fried chicken facades were updated while on the inside cooking methods veered back to the colonels basics sticking to a limited menu kept kentucky fried chickens costs down allowing the company time to recoup timing was fortunate on kentucky fried chickens turnaround it happened just in time for colonel sanders to witness after fighting leukemia for seven months harland sanders died on december   the s profits and expansion miles and mayers work culminated with the highly successful  ad campaign we do chicken right a year later in step with the fastpaced s rj reynolds industries inc acquired heublein giving kentucky fried chicken another lift the company had expansionary vision capital and the international presence to tie it all together kentucky fried chicken sales that year reached  billion by  the company had made impressive progress with  stores in the united states and  units in  foreign countries no other fastfood chain except mcdonalds could compete but while many industry insiders were crediting the team with victory mayer wasnt so quick to join in as he noted in nations restaurant news people keep talking about the turnaround at kfc id really rather not talk about it the turnaround is only halfway over with the entrance of r j reynolds came the exit of michael miles who resigned to become ceo of kraft foods mayer took over as chairman and ceo mayer continued on a cautious line for the next several years refusing to introduce new products as obsessively as its competitors in the past two years mayer said in a kfc company profile in nations restaurant news people have gone absolutely schizoid a lot of chains have blurred their image by adding so many new menu items in further commentary he added we dont roll out a flavorofthemonth pepsico buys company in  mayers conservatism gained him the respect of wall street and his peers in the fastfood industry in  softdrink giant pepsico inc bought kentucky fried chicken for  million reasons cited were kfcs superior performance and its  increase in worldwide revenue and earnings the successful operator of the pizza hut and taco bell chains pepsico did quite well introducing new products through those restaurants it was just a matter of time before kentucky fried chicken would be expected to create new products to foster new product introduction in  kentucky fried chicken opened the  million squarefoot colonel sanders technical center in addition the company began testing ovenroasted chicken through multiplefranchisee collins foods further testmarketing of home delivery was undertaken using pepsicos successful pizza hut delivery system as an example by late  donald e doyle succeeding mayer in the post of kentucky fried chickens us president inherited the task of developing new menu items the overall market for fast food seemed glutted by the late s pepsico ceo d wayne calloway saw kentucky fried chickens national niche as secure for two reasons first with competition spurred by the large number of fastfood suppliers weaker chains would inevitably leave the market second kentucky fried chicken still had room to grow in the northeast and midatlantic regions internationally the company planned  overseas openings in  japan a major market had  stores great britain had  and south africa had  kfc international headed by steven v fellingham planned to concentrate on opening units in a handful of countries where its presence was limited the peoples republic of china was the most notable new market secured in  kfc was the first american fastfood chain to open there franchisee problems with new parent company imperative to the success of kentucky fried chicken was the establishment of successful relations with the numerous franchisees most of them lauded parent pepsicos international strength and foodservice experience kfc had its own inherent strength however according to franchisees which the parent company would do well to handle with care that strength was the sharing of decisionmaking in  for instance the kentucky fried chicken advertising coop was established giving franchisees ten votes and the company three when determining advertising budgets and campaigns as a result of an antitrust suit with franchisees in  the corporation organized a national franchisee advisory council by  the company worked with franchisees to improve upon contracts made when brown and massey took over some contracts even dated back to when colonel sanders had sealed them with a handshake the national purchasing coop formed in  ensured franchisees a cut of intercompany equipment and supply sales all of these councils had created a democratic organization that not only served the franchisees well but helped keep operations running smoothly as kentucky fried chicken was shifted from one corporate parent to another as time passed however pepsicos corporate hand seemed to come down too heavily for franchisee comfort in july  ceo and chairman richard mayer resigned to return as president to general foods usa mayer who together with mike miles was credited for bringing kentucky fried chicken out of the s slump departed as the company battled over contract rights with franchisees john m cranor an executive who had joined pepsico  years earlier took over as ceo kyle craig formerly with burger king steak  ale and bennigans began in an advisory role later stepping up to become president of kfcusa within months cranor was meeting with franchisee leaders in louisville to defend parent pepsicos contract renewal among the issues debated was pepsicos plan to revise the franchiseerenewal policy which guaranteed operators the right to sell the business and an automatic tenyear extension on existing contracts with reasonable upgrading required it was in kfcs longterm interest to settle the dispute without litigation cranor believedand with good reason in august of  franchisees had established a  million legal fund averaging  per unit to fight the battle in court if necessary cranor remained optimistic relying on the history of positive relations with franchisees despite contract battles and communication troubles in the fall of  kentucky fried chicken called a oneday truce to celebrate in honor of colonel sanderss th birthday meanwhile fastfood competitors with stricter organization were keeping up with changes in consumer demand and introducing new products at a dizzying rate kfc in contrast had difficulty in creating new products linked to the cornerstone fried chicken concept as well as in getting them out quickly through franchisee stores hot wings brought out in  were kfcs only hit in a number of attempts including broiled ovenroasted skinless and sandwichstyle chicken in late september  kentucky fried chicken increased its holding of companyowned stores by buying  us units from collins foods international inc collins retained its interest in the australian kfc market the acquisition boosted kentucky fried chickens control of total operating units to  percent the corporation also added canadas scotts hospitality franchises to its fold an increase of  units to update its downhome image and respond to growing concerns about the health risks associated with fried foods in february  kentucky fried chicken changed its name to kfc new packaging still sported the classic redandwhite stripes but this time wider and on an angle implying movement and rapid service while the colonels image was retained packaging was in modern graphics and bolder colors new menu introductions were postponed as kfc once again went back to the basics to tighten up store operations and modernize units a new  million computer system not only controlled fryer cooking times it linked front counters with the kitchen drivethru window managers office and company headquarters international success in s though kfc may have had problems competing in the domestic fastfood market those same problems did not seem to trouble them in their international markets in  pretax profits were  million from international operations as opposed to  million from the us units also in the fiveyear span from  through  sales and profits for the international business nearly doubled in addition franchise relations always troublesome in the domestic business ran smoothly in kfcs international markets to continue capitalizing on their success abroad kfc undertook an aggressive construction plan that called for an average of one nonus unit to be built per day with the expectation that by  the number of international units would exceed those in the united states international sales particularly in asia continued to bolster company profits in  sales and profits of kfc outlets in asia were growing at  percent a year average per store sales in asia were  million significantly higher than in the united states where per store sales stood at  in addition profit margins in asia were double those in the united states kfc enjoyed many advantages in asia fast foods association with the west made it a status symbol the restaurants were generally more hygienic than vendor stalls and chicken was a familiar taste to asian palates the company saw great potential in the region and stepped up construction of new outlets there it planned to open  restaurants between  and  nontraditional service often stemming from successful innovations instituted in the companys international operations was seen as a way for kfc to enter new markets delivery drivethru carryout and supermarket kiosks were up and running other outlets in testing were mall and officebuilding snack shops mobile trailer units satellite units and selfcontained kiosks designed for universities stadiums airports and amusement parks to move toward the twentyfirst century executives believed kfc had to change its image we want to be the chicken store cranor stressed in a  nations restaurant news cranors goal was total concept transformation moving kfc to a more contemporary role new product introductions were part of the companys plan to keep up with competitors having allowed boston market to grab a significant portion of the chicken market kfc tried to catch up with the introduction of rotisserie gold chicken the companys new ceo david novak also decided to test colonels kitchen a clear imitation of the boston market format to counter mcdonalds and burger kings value meals kfc brought out the megameal dinner an entire rotisserie chicken chicken nuggets mashed potatoes macaroni cole slaw biscuits and a chocolate chip cake for  in  kfc expanded the idea to megamealforone and decided to test chicken pot pie and chicken salad these moves gave a small boost to kfcs image which had grown somewhat outofdate and to its bottom line however problems with the franchisees continued and pepsico was not seeing the return on its assets that it saw with its beverage and snack food divisions pepsico was having similar problems with its other restaurant subsidiaries taco bell and pizza hut and decided the drain of capital expenditure was not worth it in  the company prepared to rid itself of its restaurant division by drawing together pizza hut taco bell and kfc all operations were now overseen by a single senior manager and most back office operations including payroll data processing and accounts payable were combined in january  the company announced plans to spin off this restaurant division creating an independent publicly traded company called tricon global restaurants inc the formal plan approved by the pepsico board of directors in august  stipulated that each pepsico shareholder would receive one share of tricon stock for every ten shares of pepsico stock owned the plan also required tricon to pay a onetime distribution of  billion at the time of the spinoff if approved by the securities and exchange commission the spinoff would take place on october   pepsico ceo roger enrico explained the move our goal in taking these steps is to dramatically sharpen pepsicos focus our restaurant business has tremendous financial strength and a very bright future however given the distinctly different dynamics of restaurants and packaged goods we believe all our businesses can better flourish with two separate and distinct managements and corporate structures kfc and its franchisees did settle their contract disputes according to a press release the crux of the agreement revolves around kfc franchisees receiving permanent territorial protection in turn kfc corporation will have more direct influence over certain national advertising and public relations activities still kfc faced the need to rennovate its restaurant buildings and also faced stiff competition from boston market burger king and mcdonalds so it remained to be seen if the new parent company would refresh kfcs image and profits additional details wholly owned subsidiary of pepsico
