prioritize the proceeds from this offering to ensure maintenance of reporting status for the next twelve months if we cannot raise enough funds to start our plan of operations we would need to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing in order to develop our products even if we are able to raise enough funds to implement our plan of operations we will need to seek capital from other sources to fully develop our products the ecigarette industry is extremely competitive with low barriers to entry competition is based on availability brand development and recognition and price we compete with other sellers of ecigarettes such as big tobacco companies through their electronic cigarettes business segments independent domestic and international ecigarette companies small internet and kiosk ecigarette companies as well as multiple resellers and distributors our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to ours and through the same channels we use to sell our products we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors’ introduction of lowpriced products or innovative products cigarette excise taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products we compete with these direct competitors for sales through the internet as well as distributors wholesalers and retailers including national chain stores tobacco shops gas stations grocery chains and other outlets associated with the selling of tobacco products company description we are seeking to engage in the designing marketing and distribution of electronic cigarettes “ecigarette” in east africa ecigarettes are batterypowered products that simulate tobacco smoking through inhalation of nicotine vapor without the fire flame tobacco tar carbon monoxide ash stub smell and other chemicals found in traditional combustible cigarettes africa is poised to become the “future epicenter of the tobacco epidemic” according to a new analysis from the american cancer society  it indicates that the number of adults in africa who smoke could increase to  million by  from  million today unless leaders take steps to curb current trends the report highlights several reasons for the increase in smoking rates  in africa  of boys and  of girls smoke  both rates are high compared with other developing regions  africa is set for massive population growth the region now accounts for  of the global population  this will climb to  by  the study concludes that because of this africa will have the secondhighest number of smokers of any region by   african nations experienced strong economic growth in the s which means more people have more money to spend on cigarettes we believe this strong consumer demand will lead retailers to allocate additional shelf space to smoking related products and we will strive to offer our ecigarette products at or near points of distribution where traditional cigarettes are available in the markets we serve we believe ecigarettes offer a compelling alternative for smokers relative to traditional cigarettes our goal is to become the leading ecigarette marketer and distributor in the east africa we expect to achieve our goal by maximizing our points of distribution maintaining our lowcost position and continuing to differentiate our products and brands in order to resonate with consumers in local markets around the region our plan is to finalize our first distribution agreement by the end of february  with a health food company that has multi locations and distribution agreements with three of the top  grocery chains in kenya we are currently in negotiations to finalize this distribution agreement our strategy is to increase our future sales by penetrating new and emerging markets where we expect rising consumer incomes and an increase in demand for ecigarettes cigarette smokers in these emerging markets are our target demographic and will represent our primary source of future revenue growth we will focus on rapidly securing retail distribution in kenya and east african markets through strategic partnerships with key retailers and distributors we believe strong consumer demand will lead retailers to allocate additional shelf space to smoking related products and we strive to offer our products at or near every point of distribution where traditional cigarettes are available in the markets we serve we believe ecigarettes offer a compelling alternative for smokers relative to traditional cigarettes our goal is to become the leading ecigarette marketer and distributor in the east africa we

significantly reducing cycle times increasing throughput reducing energy costs and enabling new material selections in a broad range of customer and consumer applications automotive electronics millwork packaging and hygiene drastically reduce cure time cure time from automotive component bonding to protective and maintenance coating to can coatings poses the key bottleneck to expedited access to these respective markets this feature translates to lower applied costs via a combination of lower labor costs increased overall throughput reduced asset downtimes no heat or ultraviolet light associated with the cure of many other adhesives and coatings and in many cases lower rework rates combined these benefits reduce applied costs of fifty percent or more in many applications reduction of thermal energy input tied with expedited cure time applications such as vehicle paint injection molding and wind blade manufacturing currently require thermal heating to cure our chemilian monomer platform cures at ambient temperatures and diminishes the need for thermal heat curing a process that requires an extraordinary amount of energy and significant capital costs these benefits are particularly salient for new construction and regions where energy delivery is expensive or challenging elimination of hazardous materials bpa in can coatings formaldehyde in wood composites and styrene in glass fibers pose insidious threats to human health regulatory limits have been imposed especially on bpa usage in children’s products the sirrusdeveloped monomer platform offers viable substitutes for these harmful chemicals many of which currently lack performancedriven solutions performance improvement our class of monomers have physical properties that allow the resulting polymer to be exposed to tough environmental conditions including high heat high humidity solvents and other environmental exposure additionally due to the unique cure system that our products enable we allow for a change in partner business model and substrate selection potential results include lower cost manufacturing enhanced just in time manufacturing and discrete assembly the chemical reaction anionic polymerization this reaction occurs in our materials rapidly at room temperature allowing partners to make high molecular weight reactive products such as coatings adhesives

exhibiting high strength thermal and chemical resistance brought to you by sirrus a stepchange in technology sirrus has developed a new chemical platform based on disubstituted alkene monomers that will allow many current chemical processes to be done faster andor with less energy the materials we are manufacturing will be used to make new components that can be formulated into plastics rubber
