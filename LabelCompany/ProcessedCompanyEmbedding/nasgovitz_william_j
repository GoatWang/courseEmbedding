also known as municipal bonds the majority of these bonds were below investment grade the majority of the bonds held in the funds were generally illiquid and they were not traded on an exchange  heartland advisors pricing committee was a committee within heartland advisors that included beste bauer clark conlin winston and della the pricing committee had four voting members beste bauer clark and della  the pricing committee was responsible for among other things administering the procedures established by heartland groups board of directors for valuing securities held by the funds including making fair value determinations in accordance with such procedures in addition the pricing committee was authorized and obligated to adjust the price of any bond in the funds portfolios that did not represent the fair value of that bond  heartland advisors investment policy committee was a committee within heartland advisors that included nasgovitz beste and clark nasgovitz chaired the committee and appointed its members the investment policy committees responsibilities included among other things reviewing individual fund performance the investment policy committee had

and enforce procedures for performing credit analysis on the funds bonds and to perform periodic reviews of the funds belowinvestmentgrade securities management and pricing of the funds  heartland groups board of directors delegated the daytoday responsibility for operating and overseeing the funds to heartland advisors  heartland groups board of directors approved a set of policies and procedures pricing procedures that charged heartland advisors pricing committee with among other things oversight of the valuation of the bonds held by the funds the pricing procedures required the pricing committee to value all debt securities held by the funds at fair value determined in good faith fair value due to the lack of readily available market quotations for those securities  specifically heartland advisors the funds portfolio managers conlin and winston and heartland advisors pricing committee which included beste bauer clark and della were responsible for assuring that the funds bonds were priced at fair value  heartland advisors in turn used these bond prices to calculate the funds daily navs it was also the obligation of heartland advisors its portfolio managers and the pricing committee to insure that the funds daily navs were correct  heartland advisors calculated the funds navs on a daily basis on each day that the new york stock exchange was open for trading and subsequently published the navs in the media  the funds daily navs represented the closing price of each of the funds shares the funds daily navs were calculated by dividing the total assets of the funds including the securities held by the funds less any liabilities by the total number of outstanding shares of the funds  if the funds daily navs were overstated on a given day shareholders purchasing new shares of the funds on that day would pay too much relative to the funds actual assets while shareholders redeeming their shares on that day would receive more than they were entitled to relative to the funds actual assets thereby diluting the value of the remaining shareholders shares  although heartland groups board of directors delegated to heartland advisors the daytoday pricing of the funds bonds the board had the ultimate obligation to ensure that the prices of the funds bonds reflected their fair values misrepresentations and omissions regarding the funds  beginning in at least march  heartland advisors heartland groups directors and certain officers and employees of heartland advisors made material misrepresentations and omissions concerning the funds in commission filings and the funds promotional materials these filings and promotional materials included but were not limited to the funds june   prospectus an october   supplement to the june   prospectus the funds statement of additional information sai and correspondence to the funds shareholders  heartland advisors nasgovitz conlin winston beste and bauer were integral in preparing the documents that contained these material misrepresentations and omissions for example conlin and winston as coportfolio managers of the funds were obligated as a matter of firm practice to review and approve the information heartland advisors published pertaining to the funds they managed including the funds nasgovitz was responsible for reviewing all of heartland advisors published materials including the funds june   prospectus and sai in nasgovitzs absence beste was responsible for conducting the final review of all shareholder marketing materials including that related to the funds moreover heartland advisors procedures required beste to check the accuracy of the facts in the funds prospectus bauer as heartland advisors general counsel and compliance officer reviewed all of heartland advisors prospectuses statements of additional information and sales literature prior to publication including materials related to the funds  these material misrepresentations and omissions pertained to among other things the efforts heartland advisors undertook to manage the risks associated with investing in the funds the efforts heartland advisors and heartland groups directors undertook to assure the continued liquidity of the bonds in the funds portfolios and heartland advisors fraudulent pricing of those bonds  for example heartland advisors nasgovitz conlin winston beste and bauer misrepresented the efforts they undertook to minimize the risks associated with investing in the funds in the funds june   prospectus as supplemented as of october   these defendants represented that they managed the risks associated with the funds through intensive credit research pursuant to heartland advisors proprietary method they also represented in the same document that the funds would never invest more than  of their total assets in debt obligations rated lower than b by standard and poors rating service sp or a comparable rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization  contrary to these statements in the prospectus and supplement heartland advisors did not conduct intensive credit research into the bonds in the funds portfolios as it represented to the contrary heartland advisors fixed income research department was severely understaffed and had failed in many cases to do research on the bonds in the funds portfolios for months at a time  heartland advisors also invested more than  of its total assets in debt obligations rated lower than b by standard and poors rating service sp or a comparable rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization contrary to its representations the majority of the bonds in the funds portfolios were not rated by standard and poors or any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization instead they were assigned ratings by heartland advisors itself  in another example of the misrepresentations and omissions in the funds sai which was incorporated into the funds june   prospectus as supplemented on october   heartland advisors nasgovitz and denison expressly represented that among other things they continuously monitored the issuers of the bonds held in the funds portfolios to assure the continued liquidity of such bonds so that the funds could meet redemption requests  contrary to this representation in the funds sai as of at least august  heartland advisors nasgovitz and denison knew or recklessly failed to know that the majority of the bonds in the funds portfolios were illiquid that the funds could not meet shareholder redemption requests through the sale of those bonds and that as a result the funds had been forced to borrow millions of dollars to meet shareholder redemption requests moreover as of at least september  these defendants knew or were reckless is not knowing that the lack of liquidity threatened the funds with the possibility of having to suspend redemptions of the funds shares  for example conlin told nasgovitz and denison at an august   board of directors meeting that management of the high yield funds portfolio had been hampered by significant net redemptions and the absence of subscriptions providing new cash flow and that rebalancing of the portfolios had been difficult due to negative cash flows caused by net redemptions over an extended period at the same meeting conlin told nasgovitz and denison that there was some liquidity risk because a material percentage of the high yield funds portfolio consisted of defaulted or watch list securities and significant borrowing conlin also told nasgovitz and denison that it was possible that yearend tax loss selling would bring additional liquidity pressures  also at the august   board of directors meeting conlin told nasgovitz and denison that he would be selling securities to reduce the high yield funds outstanding loans to cure the funds cash crisis and that the bonds in the high yield fund should be able to be sold in a week in the ordinary course  at the next board of directors meeting on september   however nasgovitz and denison learned that even given an entire month to do so heartland advisors failed to sell enough bonds from the funds to solve the funds cash flow crisis contrary to conlins representation on august   by that time nasgovitz and denison also knew that conlin who had personally promised to sell bonds from the funds to raise the cash necessary to ensure the funds liquidity had resigned from heartland advisors fraudulent pricing of the funds bonds and mistatement of the funds navs  from at least march  until march  heartland advisors and certain of its officers and employees manipulated the prices of certain bonds in the funds portfolios and refused or failed to price other bonds in the portfolios at their fair values as a result the funds navs were false from at least march  until march  a smoothing of bondprice decreases  beginning in march  heartland advisors through conlin and winston began manipulating the prices of the bonds held in the funds portfolios specifically beginning on march   and continuing through at least july  conlin and winston smoothed or gradually reduced the prices of certain bonds held in the funds in concert with the funds thirdparty pricing service  for example between march   and may   conlin and winston in concert with the funds thirdparty pricing service smoothed downward the prices of six bonds held in the funds on march   these bonds prices ranged from approximately  per cent of par value to  per cent of par value beginning on that day and continuing through at least may   conlin and winston smoothed the carrying values of those six bonds downward by lowering their prices in increments of  per cent of par value per day until the bonds carrying values reached  per cent of par value  these smoothed prices were not determined in accordance with fair value principles rather than lower the prices of the bonds all at once to accurately reflect their fair values conlin and winston in concert with the funds thirdparty pricing service lowered the prices gradually in order to falsely maintain the appearance of stability of the funds navs  the prices of the bonds that conlin and winston smoothed downward did not represent the fair value of those bonds as a result from march   through at least september   the navs of the funds which incorporated these smoothed bond prices were materially false  also as a result of conlins and winstons smoothing of the funds bond prices from march   through at least september   shareholders of the funds purchased and redeemed shares of the funds at materially false navs b fraudulent overvaluation of the funds bond prices  beginning at least as early as august  and continuing through october   heartland advisors nasgovitz beste bauer conlin winston clark and della fraudulently overvalued the bonds held in the funds portfolios among other things during that period each of these defendants learned that the prices of many of the bonds were inflated but they failed to act to correct those prices to ensure that the prices reflected the bonds fair values  for example on august   beste sent an email to nasgovitz stating that the funds should expect to take a  haircut or discount to the prices of the funds bonds in order to sell them shortly thereafter on september   clark sent an email to nasgovitz beste and bauer and informed them that in the course of trying to sell bonds from the funds portfolios he had received indications of interest from buyers at levels  below those at which heartland advisors was pricing the bonds  on september   beste admitted in an email to nasgovitz and bauer that he knew the bonds were overvalued beste stated that conlin one of the funds portfolio managers was unwilling to take action required in the market since he does not agree with the discount required to sell nonrated bonds in todays sic market beste also noted the reason for conlins refusal to discount the funds bonds in order to sell them namely that it would have an impact on performance of the funds ie lower the funds navs  by at least august  beste knew that the bonds in the funds were overvalued and threatened the funds survival on august   he sent an email to nasgovitz entitled muni in which he admitted we can not wait for the melt down to begin before we act this is going to get worse before it gets better and time is working against us  likewise by at least september   clark knew that heartland advisors fraudulent overvaluation of the bonds would ultimately result in the funds collapse in an email dated september   summarizing a discussion between clark beste and bauer clark stated that i believe we are potentially days away from a literal meltdown in these funds a couple of weeks at the most at the very least we probably need to look at pricing which will probably be the beginning of the avalanche     the fraudulent overvaluation of the bonds in the funds portfolios continued up until the october devaluation a former heartland advisors analyst who was promoted to coportfolio manager for the funds after conlins departure confirmed this fact in an email to bauer and winston on october   in that email he stated that during todays pricing committee meeting it was determined that the prices provided by interactive data corp fka muller the funds thirdpart pricing service would be used to value the highyield municipal bond fund and the short duration highyield municipal fund i would like to go on record stating that these prices do not reflect the value of the bonds held in the fund  heartland advisors nasgovitz beste bauer conlin winston clark and della caused the funds bonds to be overvalued and each of these defendants failed to correct the prices of the funds bonds  to the contrary nasgovitz beste bauer clark and winston tried to cover up their pricing fraud for example on september   bauer sent an email entitled muni records to nasgovitz beste clark and winston recommending that they eliminate documents relating to the funds in her email bauer urged these defendants to eliminate on a regular basis any other material in your files including a diary research file notes or miscellaneous material involving discussions relating to portfolio securities underlying credits and valuation issues  as a result of the conduct described above from at least august  through october   the funds daily navs were materially inflated due to the fraudulent overvaluation of the funds bonds because the daily navs were inflated shareholders of the funds purchased and redeemed shares of the funds at materially inflated navs during that time period c the sham sale of bonds to the state of wisconsin investment board  in an effort to cover up the funds cash flow crisis heartland advisors through beste arranged to transfer some of the most illiquid bonds in the funds portfolios to the state of wisconsin investment board swib in return for cash  heartland advisors represented that this transfer was a sale in fact the swib transaction was structured as a shortterm loan and designed to allow heartland advisors to move illiquid bonds out of the funds portfolios and at the same time raise cash to meet shareholder redemption requests  beste negotiated the swib transaction swib informed beste that it would loan the funds  in return for a package of bonds under terms that included the following  heartland advisors would continue to manage the bonds for swib even after the swib transaction was complete  swib was entitled to put give the bonds back to heartland holdings at a  guaranteed annual rate of return and  heartland holdings and nasgovitz would personally guarantee the promised return without these terms swib would not have gone forward with the loan  in order to meet swibs terms beste lowered the prices of the bonds involved in the swib transaction by approximately  immediately before the transaction these prices did not however represent the fair value of those bonds instead beste set the prices in order to consummate the swib transaction without regard for the bonds fair value  moreover beste misrepresented the origin of the purported sale prices to both swib and the funds thirdparty pricing service beste told the funds thirdparty pricing service that the prices for the bonds involved in the swib transaction were determined by swib he told swib however that the prices for the bonds were determined by the funds thirdparty pricing service in fact beste determined the prices of the bonds d the september devaluation  as a result on september   the value of the bonds held in the highyield fund dropped by  while the value of those in the short duration fund dropped by  accordingly the highyield funds nav dropped from  to  while the short duration funds nav dropped from  to   heartland advisors misrepresented the reason for the september devaluation in a letter to shareholder dated october   that letter which nasgovitz signed and bauer reviewed stated in part that the recent decline in share price on september  was primarily due to the pricing services decision to make sizeable adjustments to the valuations of a number of securities in the funds portfolios  many of which were in the healthcarerelated sectors where the fund has been heavily weighted this explanation for the september   devaluation was false  the real reason for the funds devaluation that day was that beste arbitrarily reduced the prices of the bonds involved in the swib transaction in order to consummate the transaction this resulted in lower valuations of those bonds on september   which in turn caused the funds navs to drop on that day by  in the highyield fund and  in the short duration fund e the october devaluation  on october   heartland advisors faced the prospect of not having sufficient cash to meet redemption requests from the funds shareholders as a result heartland advisors pricing committee radically lowered the prices of the bonds in the funds portfolios in order to generate sales and thereby raise cash to meet redemption requests  on october   the pricing committee instructed winston and others to provide their best estimate of the fair values of the bonds held in the funds portfolios which they proceeded to do to these valuations however the pricing committee applied additional acrosstheboard haircuts or reductions of  to the bonds held in the high yield fund and  to the bonds held in the short duration fund  the levels to which the pricing committee lowered the bonds prices as a result of these wholesale acrosstheboard haircuts did not represent the bonds fair values in fact the pricing committee never endeavored to price the bonds at fair value on october   instead these acrosstheboard price haircuts were determined by the funds need to sell bonds and thereby raise cash to meet shareholder redemption requests this urgent need to sell bonds in turn was caused by heartland advisors failure to sell bonds in the preceding months because the bonds were fraudulently overvalued  heartland advisors nasgovitz beste bauer winston clark and della caused the improper october devaluation none of these defendants however corrected the materially incorrect prices for the funds bonds that resulted when the pricing committee applied an acrosstheboard haircut to those prices  as a result of the conduct described above the funds navs were incorrect from october   to march   because they were based on incorrect prices for the bonds held in the funds portfolios furthermore the shareholders of the funds who purchased and redeemed shares of the funds during that time period did so at materially incorrect navs  after the october devaluation heartland advisors nasgovitz beste bauer and winston misrepresented the reasons for the october devaluation to shareholders in a supplement to the funds prospectus dated october   heartland advisors represented that the reason for the october   devaluation was a current lack of liquidity in the highyield municipal bond markets generally and because of credit quality concerns and a lack of market makers market bids and representative market transactions in the specific types of securities held by the funds     this disclosure was false the real cause of the october devaluation was not what heartland advisors described in the october   supplement instead as nasgovitz admitted during a meeting with members of heartland advisors public relations firm on or about november   the october devaluation was caused by illiquid securities coupled with redemptions the portfolio was not structured properly to withstand credit risk     insider trading  between september   and october   defendants krueger bauer winston and della sold their shares of the short duration fund or the high yield fund or both while in possession of andor using material nonpublic information concerning the funds during the same time period della sold his fathers shares of heartland groups taxable short duration fund while in possession of andor using material nonpublic information concerning the funds on september   and september   respectively defendants nasgovitz and winston conveyed material nonpublic information concerning the funds to individuals not employed by heartland advisors who then sold their shares in one or both of the funds while in possession of andor using the material nonpublic information  at all times relevant to this complaint heartland advisors had written procedures prohibiting the misuse of nonpublic information obtained through the course of employment at heartland advisors these procedures expressly provided that any heartland employee who became aware of material nonpublic information should not trade for a personal or clients account recommend transactions in the security or disclose tip the information to others  at all times relevant to this complaint nasgovitz bauer winston and della were aware of these procedures a nasgovitz and krueger  krueger and nasgovitz were friends from at least the mid s until at least in or around october  for example in the mid s krueger nasgovitz and their wives vacationed together in new york similarly in or around october  krueger attended nasgovitzs daughters wedding reception at nasgovitzs house in santa barbara california  krueger began investing in heartland groups funds in  as of the morning of september   krueger owned  shares of the short duration fund as well as shares of heartland groups firstar money market fund heartland value plus fund and heartland value fund  on september   nasgovitz possessed material nonpublic information concerning the funds including but not limited to the following the impending transfer of bonds from the funds to swib the funds continuing cash flow crisis the funds materially false navs heartland advisors failure to sell bonds at the inflated prices heartland advisors assigned to them and heartland advisors failure to accurately price the bonds in the funds portfolios  on september   krueger and nasgovitz had lunch together at louisas restaurant in milwaukee wisconsin their lunch meeting began at approximately  am and lasted approximately one hour this was the only meeting between krueger and nasgovitz in  during their lunch meeting on september   nasgovitz conveyed material nonpublic information to krueger concerning the short duration fund  during their lunch meeting krueger and nasgovitz discussed kruegers investments in the heartland group funds according to nasgovitz the discussion included kruegers investment in the short duration fund  immediately after lunch krueger and nasgovitz returned to heartland advisors offices together at  pm while at heartland advisors offices and approximately one hour after his lunch meeting with nasgovitz krueger sold all of his shares in the short duration fund while in possession of andor using the material nonpublic information nasgovitz conveyed to krueger at their lunch meeting at the same time krueger placed an order to sell all of his sons shares in the short duration fund however his son did not own any shares of the funds at the time  krueger did not however sell any shares he held in heartland groups firstar money market fund heartland value plus fund or heartland value fund when he liquidated his shares in the short duration fund on september    nasgovitz knew or had reason to know that the information he conveyed to krueger pertaining to the short duration fund was nonpublic  krueger knew or had reason to know that nasgovitz had access to and possessed nonpublic information concerning the short duration fund in the course of his employment at heartland advisors and heartland group  krueger knew or had reason to know that it was improper for nasgovitz to convey to krueger nonpublic information he obtained in the course of his employment at heartland advisors and heartland group  as a result of his sale on september   krueger avoided losses of approximately  b bauer  bauer simultaneously held multiple positions at heartland advisors in the months preceding the october devaluation between august  and october   she was heartland advisors general counsel and compliance officer the chairperson of its pricing committee and one of its senior vice presidents in addition nasgovitz placed bauer on heartland advisors credit committee in july   furthermore at all times relevant to this complaint bauer was one of only four members of heartland advisors pricing committee that could vote on matters affecting the funds  because of the multiple positions she held bauer possessed extensive nonpublic information concerning the funds immediately before she sold her shares of the short duration fund on october   specifically bauer knew that the bonds in the short duration funds portfolio were overvalued she also knew that beginning in at least september  the funds were involved in a cash flow crisis that heartland advisors could not raise enough money from the sale of bonds to meet shareholder redemption requests in the funds and that heartland advisors was considering suspending redemptions in the funds as a means of solving these problems  for example on september   clark emailed bauer and informed her that he had received offers to buy bonds from the funds at levels  below those at which heartland advisors was pricing the bonds on september   beste emailed bauer and told her that the funds would be required to take a discount in order to sell nonrated bonds in todays market thus bauer knew that the bonds in the short duration funds portfolio were overvalued  as a further example on september   bauer knew that heartland advisors was using all of its cash to pay redemptions in the funds and that as a result heartland advisors could not actively manage the funds however she instructed heartland advisors shareholder services representatives not to tell this information to the funds shareholders  before she sold her shares in the short duration fund bauer also knew the specific schedule of investments in the short duration fund the default percentage for the funds as well as the reasons for the september devaluation  moreover bauer knew that the swib transaction would not solve the funds liquidity crisis for example prior to the swib transaction clark informed bauer in an email that the swib transaction was a very shortterm solution that would impair heartland advisors ability to resolve the funds cash flow crisis  furthermore nasgovitz sent an email to bauer and others before the swib transaction stating that the swib transaction would entail lower prices for the securities and will result in losses for    the funds bauer also knew prior to the swib transaction that heartland advisors was considering asking the sec for permission to suspend redemptions in the funds if the swib transaction resulted in continued redemptions  the foregoing information and other information bauer possessed concerning the funds as of october   was material and nonpublic  on the morning of october   bauer owned  shares of the short duration fund at  am on october   bauer sold all of her shares in the short duration fund while in possession of andor using the material nonpublic information she possessed concerning the funds  as a result of her sale on october   bauer avoided losses of approximately  c winston  between january  and march  winston was a coportfolio manager of the funds he was also an alternate member of heartland advisors pricing committee and regularly attended meetings of the pricing committee throughout september and october  from at least september  to june  he was a vice president of heartland advisors as such winston possessed extensive nonpublic information concerning the funds immediately before the october devaluation  for example as a coportfolio manager for the funds winston knew that beginning in at least august  the funds were unable to sell sufficient bonds at the prices assigned to them by heartland advisors to meet shareholder redemption requests he therefore also knew that the prices of those bonds were materially overvalued and that as a result the funds navs were materially
