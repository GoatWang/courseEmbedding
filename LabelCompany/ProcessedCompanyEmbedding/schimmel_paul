the scripps research institute recruits prominent scientists to join its ranks  news release research research overview decoding genetic information in translationthe genetic code was established over two billion years ago and became universally adopted by all living organisms the rules of the codewhich relate specific nucleotide triplets to specific amino acidsare established by aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by aminoacyl trna synthetases in these reactions an amino acid is associated with a specific nucleotide triplet of the genetic code by virtue of being linked to a specific trna that harbors the anticodon triplet cognate to the amino acid because of their central role in establishing the rules of the code the trnas are thought to have arisen quite early perhaps in the context of an rna world the synthetases may have been amongst the earliest proteins to appear perhaps replacing ribozymes that catalyzed the aminoacylation of primordial trnas the schimmel laboratory is interested in understanding all aspects of these systems the cloverleaf structure of trna is folded into two domainsone contains the anticodon with the template reading head of the genetic code and the other called the minihelix domain contains the amino acid attachment site the minihelix domain itself is a substrate for aminoacylation for at least ten of the synthetases even smaller pieces than the minihelix are active as substrates see figure because these pieces lack the anticodon trinucleotides the relationship between the sequencesstructures of these active pieces with as few as four base pairs and the specific amino acid is distinct from the genetic code the relationship between sequences and structures in trna acceptor stems and specific amino acids is referred to as an operational rna code for amino acids the operational rna code is thought to have predated the genetic codeour recent studies have expanded upon these concepts to elucidate a role for the trna in amino acid fine structure recognition that is the ability to distinguish between two closely similar amino acids is greatly enhanced by an effector function of the trna that causes the rejection of amino acids that are not exactly matched with the synthetase and its cognate trna this rnadependent fine structure recognition may have first developed in an rna world and later was incorporated into the synthetase system as a critical part of maintaining the accuracy of the genetic code background education and training phd in biology massachusetts institute of technology  awards and honors member

biochemistry and biophysics in the department of biology at mit schimmel is author or coauthor of more than  scientific papers and of a widely used threevolume textbook on biophysical chemistry for his achievements and discoveries in scientific research in the biological sciences schimmel has been elected member of the american academy of arts and sciences the national academy of sciences the

biopharmaceutical society’s brilliant achievement award the perlman award lecture of the american chemical society and the nucleic acids award lecture of the biochemical society and royal society of chemistry uk he has been active in many scientific and academic organizations and committees including service as chairman of the division of biological chemistry of the american chemical society and as an editorial board member of ten different scientific journals for his entire career schimmel’s research focused on a group of universal enzymes known as aminoacyl trna synthetases the synthetases are believed by many to be among the first enzymes to arise on this planet in the early stages of the evolution of life these enzymes translate the genetic information in all living organisms in each cell there is a separate trna synthetase for each of the  amino acids in translating or interpreting the genetic material they catalyze reactions whereby each amino acid is matched with a nucleotide triplet embedded in its cognate trna in this way the trna synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code and because of this role trna synthetases are essential for all forms of life because of decades of research of schimmel and others this group of enzymes is now understood to have additional novel functions and to have deeprooted connections to human diseases schimmel and his wife cleo have two daughters and eight grandchildren principal scientific contributionsedit correcting mistranslation of genetic materialedit schimmel’s laboratory discovered a universal mechanism for correcting errors in the translation mistranslation of the genetic material this mechanism is regarded as one of the most fundamental in biology specifically they discovered an activity in aminoacyl trna synthetases that removes an amino acid that has been charged to the wrong trna he later discovered the novel module in synthetases that encodes this deacylase activity in mammalian cellbased experiments and in experiments in mice with collaborators at the jackson laboratories they showed that defects in this translational errorcorrection mechanism gives rise to profound pathologies including neurodegeneration these error correction activities were shown to be intimately associated with the beginnings of living organisms discovery of the second genetic codeedit schimmel’s laboratory discovered what has been referred to as a “second genetic code” that relates specific atomic determinants in small rna substrates to specific aminoacylation this rna code is considered to give critical insights into the development of the modern genetic code and protein synthesis discovery of the modular design of aminoacyl trna synthetasesedit schimmel and coworkers were among the first to use genetic methods to establish the modular design of proteins in general and of aminoacyl trna synthetases in particular development of expressed sequence tags ests for genomicsedit while schimmel’s research program has largely focused on aminoacyl trna synthetases in a separate line of research published in  schimmel developed the concept of what are now known as ests expressed sequence tags and the strategy of shotgun sequencing approaches that several years later were adopted for the human genome project ests provide a way to identify all genes that are expressed in a specific tissue such as muscle among others nature magazine listed schimmel’s work on ests as one of the four key developments that launched the human genome project expansion of the functional genomeedit the schimmel laboratory discovered how trna synthetases undergo functional “metamorphosis” in human cells to acquire novel activities in signal transduction pathways ranging from the inflammatory response to angiogenesis this work led to efforts to commercialize applications of human synthetases to treat diseases educationedit ab  ohio wesleyan university medical student – tufts

campus research focus decoding genetic information in translationthe genetic code was established over two billion years ago and became universally adopted by all living organisms the rules of the codewhich relate specific nucleotide triplets to specific amino acidsare established by aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by aminoacyl trna synthetases in these reactions an amino acid is associated with a specific nucleotide triplet of the genetic code by virtue of being linked to a specific trna that harbors the anticodon triplet cognate to the amino acid because of their central role in establishing the rules of the code the trnas are thought to have arisen quite early perhaps in the context of an rna world the synthetases may have been amongst the earliest proteins to appear perhaps replacing ribozymes that catalyzed the aminoacylation of primordial trnas the schimmel laboratory is interested in understanding all aspects of these systems our present work focuses on the discovery of the large new biology that flows out of the trna synthetases these enzymes are now known to be secreted to have nuclear functions and to pervade most or all parts of human biology with activities that are distinct from their catalytic function of charging trna the laboratory uses methods and logic of molecular and cell biology chemistry and structural analysis to more deeply investigate these novel functions that have a fundamental role in maintaining organismal homeostasis and in developing and regulating nervous vascular and immunological systems the research is leading to the development of a broad new class of therapeutics to treat and cure human diseases education phd biophysical chemistry massachusetts institute of technology  awards  professional activities mcarthur

httpsglobaloupcomacademiccoverspopup rumi annemarie schimmel and translated by paul bergne makers of islamic civilization situates rumi in his religious and literary context rumi annemarie schimmel and translated by paul bergne makers of islamic civilization description jalaluddin rumi  is the most famous exponent of the mystical tradition in islam and venerated as mevlana our master the still flourishing mevlevi order of dervishes famous for their ecstatic music and dance was organized by his eldest son on the basis of rumis teaching and practice he spent most of his life in konya in rum modern anatolia whence the name rumi his longest work the mathnavi has held its reputation in the eastern lands of the islamic world as the most recited and venerated text after the quran echoes of the muslim scripture and traces of rumis education as a traditional muslim jurist or faqih are apparent throughout his writings the resurgence of interest in rumi in the west has evolved into a cult especially on american college campuses as schimmel explains this cult does not do justice to the profound spiritual passion and insights of the mathnavi and rumis divan in this concise readable essay she sketches the major landmarks in rumis life and the influences on it the religious and cultural background of his poetic sufism the dominant strands of imagery and the range of tone and anecdote that animate his spiritual world she explains why rumi as poet and mystic must be understood in the persian literary and the islamic religious traditions to which he belonged it is through those traditions that he experienced and expressed the divine love that the peoples of all faith traditions immediately recognize and affirm the closing chapters review recent scholarship and translations of rumis works in west and east and answer the question what does rumi mean to us in the modern world show more rumi annemarie schimmel and translated by paul bergne makers of islamic civilization
