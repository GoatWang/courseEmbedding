he was the son of asel a and mary warne gates gates had two older brothers george and gilbert but both had died by the time he was  years oldab while gates was raised in a religious household his mother mary became more religious after the deaths of her two older sons because he had been involved in some harmless childhood mischief in both grammar and sunday school he was accused of stealing a collection at the sunday school he was barred from attending church as a resultc gates was raised on the familys farm but did not care for farm life at an early age he entered into his first business proposition to husk a neighbors corn his next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor gates earned us for this job selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine as this type of equipment was very new at the time few farms owned one so gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms after one season gates tired of this type of work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend gates then set himself up as a local grain broker doing business from the familys home this business venture was a failure in an effort to escape farm work he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood the railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them with the grain brokerage now forgotten he was able to make up the losses at the card table while attending a house party near st charles he met and fell in love with a farmers daughter dellora baker gates proposed to her at one of the house parties dellora was willing to accept gates proposal but wondered how he would be able to provide for a wife as his only income came from winning at the railroad poker games when his father discovered gates in a poker game with some railroad men in the familys barn asel told his son he was no good and would never be any good only marys mediation stopped her son from leaving home with the realization that he needed more education than grammar school had provided he announced to his parents that he would be enrolling in some local college classes gates attended some courses at nearby wheaton college and graduated from north central college in  he had little opportunity to put his new business education to work as the financial panic of  began just as he was completing his college work in order to be able to marry dellora gates accepted every type of job he could get for the next year most of them were for farm work gates and dellora were married on february  d marriage and early business venturesedit gates tried to revive to his grain brokerage business but lost all his savings through it when the couples first child was stillborn gates returned to his old pattern of playing poker and thought seriously about leaving town with dellora with this knowledge mary gates told her husband he needed to help his son financially so he could start a new business gates fatherinlaw ed baker had already offered to help his daughter and son in law in this way asel purchased a twostory brick building and ed baker provided the capital for stock to open a hardware store in turner junction at first the business went well gates and dellora were able to move into their own home gates began taking time away from the hardware store and while his partner tried to handle all the business he was not able to a son charles gilbert gates was born to gates and dellora on may   gates began to complain of various ailments soon after the babys birth at times he would take to his bed for some days with them business at the hardware store had become so bad gates was not able to afford the rent on the familys home they had to move into two rooms above the hardware store with gates saying he was too ill to help with the moving and packing while at the hardware store gates met a salesman who was in the barbed wire business as a result gates became interested in the relatively new product when he announced his intentions to sell his interest in the hardware store and become a traveling salesman for the product his wife and mother were both in favor of the plane he made a trip to san antonio texas in  where isaac ellwood hired him as a salesman for the washburnmoen barbed wire company after being assigned to work in texas gates quickly learned that while he found friends and poker playing companions when it came to selling barbed wire ranchers were not buying after watching a medicine show proprietor stage an elaborate presentation for his wares and noting that people fought to buy the products sold gates decided to have a similar production to demonstrate the merits of barbed wire in san antonios military plaza gates provoked cattle into charging into a barbed wire fence which did not break gates went from not being able to sell his product to not being able to fill orders quickly enough after the demonstration the barbed wire and steel businessedit upon ellwoods refusal to grant him a partnership in the company gates traveled to st louis missouri where in partnership with alfred clifford he started the southern wire company to compete with washburnmoen cliffords equipment to manufacture barbed wire had come from george c baker who had invented a machine for producing barbed wire which was similar but not identical to the one made by isaac ellwood baker had resisted all attempts by ellwood and washburnmoen to buy him out gates and clifford sold their product at a cheaper price than washburnmoen before long washburnmoen was losing substantial business to gates and cliffords southern wire company in an effort to stop the success of the former company salesman ellwood and washburnmoen filed for an injunction to stop the business of southern wire company the suit filed in u s district court claimed the machines gates and clifford used in the production of their product were a direct copy of those used by washburnmoen the suit also called for gates and clifford to pay us in damages to the company as they avoided process servers gates and clifford made a plan to save their company they were able to rent a building in east st louis illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory and onto a ferryboat after dark after they crossed the mississippi river the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the st louis u s district court and were back in business the next dayf when clifford and gates hired an attorney to answer the charges made against them in court the judge ruled that the manufacturing process used by southern wire company was not an infringement on any patents or machinery owned by ellwood and washburnmoen gates owned the sydney kent house at  south michigan avenue on chicagos south side from  to  the house is now listed on the national register of historic places after a fire destroyed the southern wire company gates gambled on the idea that william edenborn had not heard the news and approached him for a merger with the idea that southern wire would manufacture in edenborns now idle barbed wire plant the new company was known as st louis wire mill company they continued to buy other wire companies and had strong sales washburnmoen went back into court this time in des moines iowa where a federal judge ruled that the machinery created by baker was an infringement of washburnmoens patents by this time gates had created a syndicate of barbed wire manufacturers who did not produce their wares using washburnmoens methods the ruling in favor of washburnmoen only applied to areas in the jurisdiction of the u s federal court in des moines washburnmoen continued to falter isaac ellwood sent word asking for a meeting with gates ellwood and another key figure with washburnmoen john lambert now accepted offers from gates the barbed wire legal issues ended with washburnmoen selling their patent rights to gates and his syndicate of wire manufacturers through a series of mergers and acquisitions the company went through various name changes finally settling on american steel and wire company gates and his family moved to chicago where they lived for a period of ten years chicago attorney elbert henry gary had helped gates form the syndicate which led to the defeat of washburnmoen gary was called on again in  to negotiate a merger with j p morgans u s steel though he had provided gates with some loans and advice in the past morgan did not want gates to be a part of the merged company saying that there was only a deal without gates morgan made an offer to gates for the american steel and wire company telling him that he was not welcome to take part in the business of u s steeleither as part of management or on the companys board of directors morgan continued by saying that if gates did not accept his offer u s steel intended to build its own wire production plantg railroads oil and port

and james j hill of the northern pacific railway both men sought control of the chicago burlington and quincy railroad hill who was financed by j p morgan needed access to chicago harriman was interested in stopping hill from obtaining it gates saw this as an opportunity to get back at morgan for his refusal to seat him on the board of u s steel along with harriman he began buying shares of northern pacific stock when james hill noted a sudden rise in northern pacific stock prices he traveled to new york to consult with morgan morgan and hill stopped the sales of the northern pacific stock which remained high while other stocks took steep drops those who had been selling short could not obtain enough stock to cover themselves and were faced with large financial losses it was rumored that gates was short  shares of northern pacific stock gates did not confirm or deny any of the rumors about the railroad stock and would only say that he was doing well as gates continued to search for a way to get back at morgan for cutting him out of u s steel he found a vulnerability in morgans railroad holdings in  and began buying large numbers of shares in morgans louisville and nashville railroad when it was decided to add another short line to the ln system its board of directors voted to issue  new shares of stock to finance the new line a clerical error offered the stock

that gates now owned more than  percent of the louisville and nashvilles stock morgan decided to act to stop another wall street panic and asked what gates terms of sale would be gates wanted us per

learned he was described in the local circuit court as a high roller and a gambler gates returned to new york to try utilizing the federal court system there as the legal wrangles continued the stock of the company began dropping in value during this time gates lost us million but still was unsure of his legal status with colorado fuel and iron osgood announced he was willing to meet gates halfway

slosssheffield iron and steel company in alabama all three were able to use inexpensive southern iron ore to produce quality steel with the open hearth process making the price of the steel produced with it cheaper the minerals needed for the open hearth process were readily found in alabama gates envisioned bringing republic tennessee coal and iron and slosssheffield together into a steel trust to challenge j p morgans u s steel when august belmont jr resigned his seat on republics board to concentrate on consolidating the new york transit system gates was elected to fill belmonts seatl

wall street brokerage gates now began purchasing shares of tennessee coal and iron in preparation of the consolidation in january  he was ready to outline his plan to potential members of the trust with the exception of republics president a w thompson when thompson was advised of the scheme he declared there would be no such trust with republic as a member when put to a formal vote republics board members voted down the idea of joining a trust during this time gates was able to purchase enough shares of tennessee coal and iron to give him a controlling interest in the company gates was riding high with both republic and tennessee coal and iron doing well with more orders that both could fill his assessment of the openhearth process for steel production was confirmed by a report from the us bureau of corporations the report stated that an agent for u s steel and a large railroad affiliated with j p morgan pronounced the rails produced by the openhearth process to be twice as good

depositor he would still have us million in assets when the clearing house run by j p morgan audited the banks books they found the bank was sound but were quite interested in the tennessee coal and iron company stock they found and indicated that the stock was not acceptable to them as securityno morgan proposed to buy tennessee coal and iron to rescue all involved with the company he outlined a plan whereby u s steel would change its second mortgage bonds for tennessee coal and iron stockp because the u s steel bonds were acceptable to the clearing house they would be able to be used for the debts it was suggested that president theodore roosevelt be consulted before such action was taken roosevelt was given only an outline of the issue he was never told which institution would fail without u s steels takeover of tennessee coal and iron roosevelt wrote a note to his attorney general stating he had not learned the name of the troubled business but felt that he should not object to this occurrence the new york times however printed its amazement that tennessee coal and iron stocks were not acceptable to the clearing house and that the trust company of america was deemed insolvent when it had more than enough assets to cover all deposits the newspaper concluded that u s steel wanted to take over a serious business competitor and the company was only worried about the sherman antitrust act all of this had taken place before gates was able to return to new york when he was briefed on the situation he was told that all other members of the coalition had agreed to morgans terms q while gates realized he had no choice but to submit his shares of stock he insisted that all stockholders were to be treated equally with regard to the rate of exchange of their shares

and standard oil the house of representatives formed a committee to examine the dealings of morgans company congressman augustus owsley stanley of kentucky was named chairman of the committee in his long list of persons to subpoena for their testimony the first was john gates gates appeared to give his testimony on may   he was seriously ill and this was evident by how thin and pale he had become he planned a trip to paris to consult with doctors there after his testimony gates spoke of all of his dealings with j p morgan from the american steel and wire company to the louisville and nashville railroad and to the time when control of tennessee coal and iron company was wrested from him forcibly he left for paris while the committee was still in session the result of the hearings was an

at the same speed one of gates associates spotted two raindrops that were moving at the same rate and pointed them out to him gates selected a raindrop and bet his associate that it would reach the bottom of the window first his associate took him up on the bet and before gates raindrop had won the race the bets had changed from hundreds of dollars to thousands gates believed that all life was a

of an associate when wyeth won gates had profited close to us  at yet another race gates won us from his large bets the jockey club president august belmont jr asked gates to limit his bets to us as

morgan  j p morgan was a member of both clubs  the united states realty company was also the builder of new yorks plaza hotel  some local trouble makers decided to threaten the waiters the entire wait staff was ready to quit when gates arrived one morning because they were afraid gates asked his waiters to stay where they were and then sent his valet to his home for a rifle while he waited for the rifle gates tried speaking to both groups when the rifle arrived gates grabbed it and shouted now by god ill shoot the first man who tries to go and ill shoot the first sonofabitch who tries to make him go the trouble making crowd dispersed the waiters stayed and were no longer troubled by threats  some ten years later it was said that the company was a very poor investment as its shares of common stock had not produced a cent of dividends in all that time  august belmont jr previously had words with gates about the size of hie horse racing bets  this was not in keeping with the pledge made to gates and the other coalition members they had all agreed not to dispose of the companys stocks and not to use them for speculation  no answer was provided as to why no tennessee coal and iron company stock was acceptable to morgans clearing house the company was valued at us million its stock had a par value of us per share tennessee coal and iron had been operating at peak capacity through that summer many u s steel plants had been idled and its common stock had dropped from   to    grant schley was once more pressured for payment he again offered his tennessee coal and iron

had never been quoted lower than us a share he went on to say that the panic was used as a ruse to get control of the company  j p morgan was initially hailed as a hero for putting an end to the panic a few months later the newspapers were writing different stories about the incident it was acknowledged that what was done with tennessee coal and iron stocks was a bold violation of the sherman antitrust act financial expert john moody wrote that if the panic was ended by this transaction it was ended by taking a few million from one pocket and putting millions into another morgans associates were accused of lying to roosevelt about the issue being serious enough to affect the united states roosevelt was chided for believing the lie roosevelt continued to state he believed the issue was serious enough to affect the nation however he would not release reports about the matter which were drawn by both the bureau of corporations and the department of justice senator charles allen culberson introduced a measure in the us senate demanding the release of this information when roosevelt countered that congress had no power to impel the executive branch of the us government to release information it had collected for its own use the senate chose to investigate roosevelts attorney general for failure to enforce the sherman antitrust act when it came to u s steel the resolution was approved but roosevelt still refused to release the reports claiming they were nobodys damn business the committee chose to continue the investigation without the reports  the new york times continued to follow the story and printed in a january  edition that a certain new york banker would testify that tennessee coal and iron was a stable company with giltedged stock values and that roosevelt had been misled hearings began on january  behind closed doors but reporters were able to determine enough of the events that took place to file news stories oakleigh thorne testified that his bank was not helped by the actions of morgan stock broker grant schley said his brokerage could have been assisted without demanding his tennessee coal and iron stock morgans representative was both evasive and forgetful when questioned roosevelt who was in the process of leaving office was not censured for his actions because the senate committee was deadlocked  on this question the new york times wrote if the president had been less dear to americans it is likely there would have been such reluctance to revise his discretion in a difficult case this is an example of saying one man can steal while another is sent to jail for looking over the fence the verdict is not guiltybut dont do it again public ire about j p morgan and u s steels role in the events of  did not diminish when the senate hearing was ended in early   gates and his group of investors had previously provided the funding for new yorks luna park and its hippodrome  gates son charlie died in his sleep in his

demonstration of the wire in san antonios military plaza with charging cattle failing to break the barbed wire fences he had set up he then proved very successful in selling the companys product and went on to start his own barbed wire manufacturing business which eventually led to the production of steel in the process his company was purchased by j p morgans u s steel gates was not invited to

illinois then known as turner junction on may   he was the son of asel a and mary warne gates gates had two older brothers george and gilbert but both had died by the time he was  years oldab while gates was raised in a religious household his mother mary became more religious after the deaths of her two older sons because he had been involved in some harmless childhood mischief in both grammar and sunday school he was accused of stealing a collection at the sunday school he was barred from attending church as a resultc gates was raised on the familys farm but did not care for farm life at an early age he entered into his first business proposition to husk a neighbors corn his next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor gates earned us for this job selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine as this type of equipment was very new at the time few farms owned one so gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms after one season gates tired of this type of work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend gates then set himself up as a local grain broker doing business from the familys home this business venture was a failure in an effort to escape farm work he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood the railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them with the grain brokerage now forgotten he was able to make up the losses at the card table while attending a house party near st charles he met and fell in love with a farmers daughter dellora baker gates proposed to her at one of the house parties dellora was willing to accept gates proposal but wondered how he would be able to provide for a wife as his only income came from winning at the railroad poker games when his father discovered gates in a poker game with some railroad men in the familys barn asel told his son he was no good and would never be any good only marys mediation stopped her son from leaving home with the realization that he needed more education than grammar school had provided he announced to his parents that he would be enrolling in some local college classes gates attended some courses at nearby wheaton college and graduated from north central college in  he had little opportunity to put his new business education to work as the financial panic of  began just as he was completing his college work in order to be able to marry dellora gates accepted every type of job he could get for the next year most of them were for farm work gates and dellora were married on february  d marriage and early business venturesedit gates tried to revive to his grain brokerage business but lost all his savings through it when the couples first child was stillborn gates returned to his old pattern of playing poker and thought seriously about leaving town with dellora with this knowledge mary gates told her husband he needed to help his son financially so he could start a new business gates fatherinlaw ed baker had already offered to help his daughter and son in law in this way asel purchased a twostory brick building and ed baker provided the capital for stock to open a hardware store in turner junction at first the business went well gates and dellora were able to move into their own home gates began taking time away from the hardware store and while his partner tried to handle all the business he was not able to a son charles gilbert gates was born to gates and dellora on may   gates began to complain of various ailments soon after the babys birth at times he would take to his bed for some days with them business at the hardware store had become so bad gates was not able to afford the rent on the familys home they had to move into two rooms above the hardware store with gates saying he was too ill to help with the moving and packing while at the hardware store gates met a salesman who was in the barbed wire business as a result gates became interested in the relatively new product when he announced his intentions to sell his interest in the hardware store and become a traveling salesman for the product his wife and mother were both in favor of the plane he made a trip to san antonio texas in  where isaac ellwood hired him as a salesman for the washburnmoen barbed wire company after being assigned to work in texas gates quickly learned that while he found friends and poker playing companions when it came to selling barbed wire ranchers were not buying after watching a medicine show proprietor stage an elaborate presentation for his wares and noting that people fought to buy the products sold gates decided to have a similar production to demonstrate the merits of barbed wire in san antonios military plaza gates provoked cattle into charging into a barbed wire fence which did not break gates went from not being able to sell his product to not being able to fill orders quickly enough after the demonstration the barbed wire and steel businessedit upon ellwoods refusal to grant him a partnership in the company gates traveled to st louis missouri where in partnership with alfred clifford he started the southern wire company to compete with washburnmoen cliffords equipment to manufacture barbed wire had come from george c baker who had invented a machine for producing barbed wire which was similar but not identical to the one made by isaac ellwood baker had resisted all attempts by ellwood and washburnmoen to buy him out gates and clifford sold their product at a cheaper price than washburnmoen before long washburnmoen was losing substantial business to gates and cliffords southern wire company in an effort to stop the success of the former company salesman ellwood and washburnmoen filed for an injunction to stop the business of southern wire company the suit filed in u s district court claimed the machines gates and clifford used in the production of their product were a direct copy of those used by washburnmoen the suit also called for gates and clifford to pay us in damages to the company as they avoided process servers gates and clifford made a plan to save their company they were able to rent a building in east st louis illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory and onto a ferryboat after dark after they crossed the mississippi river the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the st louis u s district court and were back in business the next dayf when clifford and gates hired an attorney to answer the charges made against them in court the judge ruled that the manufacturing process used by southern wire company was not an infringement on any patents or machinery owned by ellwood and washburnmoen gates owned the sydney kent house at  south michigan avenue on chicagos south side from  to  the house is now listed on the national register of historic places after a fire destroyed the southern wire company gates gambled on the idea that william edenborn had not heard the news and approached him for a merger with the idea that southern wire would manufacture in edenborns now idle barbed wire plant the new company was known as st louis wire mill company they continued to buy other wire companies and had strong sales washburnmoen went back into court this time in des moines iowa where a federal judge ruled that the machinery created by baker was an infringement of washburnmoens patents by this time gates had created a syndicate of barbed wire manufacturers who did not produce their wares using washburnmoens methods the ruling in favor of washburnmoen only applied to areas in the jurisdiction of the u s federal court in des moines washburnmoen continued to falter isaac ellwood sent word asking for a meeting with gates ellwood and another key figure with washburnmoen john lambert now accepted offers from gates the barbed wire legal issues ended with washburnmoen selling their patent rights to gates and his syndicate of wire manufacturers through a series of mergers and acquisitions the company went through various name changes finally settling on american steel and wire company gates and his family moved to chicago where they lived for a period of ten years chicago attorney elbert henry gary had helped gates form the syndicate which led to the defeat of washburnmoen gary was called on again in  to negotiate a merger with j p morgans u s steel though he had provided gates with some loans and advice in the past morgan did not want gates to be a part of the merged company saying that there was only a deal without gates morgan made an offer to gates for the american steel and wire company telling him that he was not welcome to take part in the business of u s steeleither as part of management or on the companys board of directors morgan continued by saying that if gates did not accept his offer u s steel intended to build its own wire production plantg railroads oil and port arthur texasedit gates never forgot j p morgans snub at the u s steel merger one month after the deal was completed he became involved in a struggle between e h harriman of the union pacific railroad and james j hill of the northern pacific railway both men sought control of the chicago burlington and quincy railroad hill who was financed by j p morgan needed access to chicago harriman was interested in stopping hill from obtaining it gates saw this as an opportunity to get back at morgan for his refusal to seat him on the board of u s steel along with harriman he began buying shares of northern pacific stock when james hill noted a sudden rise in northern pacific stock prices he traveled to new york to consult with morgan morgan and hill stopped the sales of the northern pacific stock which remained high while other stocks took steep drops those who had been selling short could not obtain enough stock to cover themselves and were faced with large financial losses it was rumored that gates was short  shares of northern pacific stock gates did not confirm or deny any of the rumors about the railroad stock and would only say that he was doing well as gates continued to search for a way to get back at morgan for cutting him out of u s steel he found a vulnerability in morgans railroad holdings in  and began buying large numbers of shares in morgans louisville and nashville railroad when it was decided to add another short line to the ln system its board of directors voted to issue  new shares of stock to finance the new line a clerical error offered the stock for sale before it could be listed on the new york stock exchange gates saw the offering and purchased the shares prior to their listing he also continued buying all the louisville and nashville stock he was able to gates had enough shares of the railroad to duplicate the panic that ensued the year before with the great northern railway shares j p morgan learned of the events in april  and found that gates now owned more than  percent of the louisville and nashvilles stock morgan decided to act to stop another wall street panic and asked what gates terms of sale would be gates wanted us per share of stock an offer which morgan initially rejected he then dispatched his aide george walbridge perkins to talk to gates and make the best possible arrangements perkins called on gates in his waldorfastoria suite at  am the deal for the louisville and nashville cost morgan us million with gates making a more than us million profit from the transaction oil gusher at port arthur texas  after the louisville and nashville railroad incident gates found that public opinion had turned against him as a result of it gates talked some associates into submitting his sons name for membership in the new york yacht club and new yorks union league clubh the application for charlie gates went from one desk to another for a number of weeks when young gates name was brought up for a vote the members of the admissions committee were unanimous in their no decision gates threatened to sue the club and the members denied his charges of morgan being behind charlie gates refusal gates withdrew charlies yacht club and union league club applications apparently resigned that his son would not be a member of either society when he and dellora traveled to england the couple wanted to stay at claridges as they had done in  claridges refused to accept their registration as gates was now on the hotels list of undesirables pattillo higgins had begun a well on spindletop in  but ran out of money to continue drilling for oil higgins went to gates for funds to continue gates obliged and founded the texas company later known as

the plaza on the site the hotel sabine had once occupied gates could have easily afforded to finance the entire cost of the new hotel but he wanted port arthurs residents to have an equal share in the venture gates held local meetings and was happy to discuss the project or take pledges for the building fund at any time after the pledges of local businessmen had reached us gates donated the remaining us and the project began to be built by united states realty companyi gates took great pleasure in watching the plaza hotel take shape he was a daily visitor to the construction site as the spanish mission style building was erected when the hotel was opened gates held a special billion dollar banquet on november   his guests were men who owned railroads texas company board members and other successful men in business port arthur had never seen so many wealthy and powerful men and residents were impressed by the sight of them gates served as the hotels manager in the first few weeks it was in operation he hired africanamericans as waiters this was considered to be very bold as africanamericans were barred from living and working in the city at the timej the steel industry and dashed hopesedit gates continued to have hopes of being able to take on j p morgan againthis time with a rival steel trust after the sale of his louisville and nashville railroad stocks to morgan in  gates quietly began buying shares of colorado fuel and iron company he and his associates easily owned more than  percent of the companys stock shares but the companys owner and founder john c osgood claimed the shares were not valid osgood said that while the company was listed on the new york stock exchange any transfer of the shares without his signature and approval made them invalid he went on to say that because of their invalidity those who held shares of the companys stock without them were not eligible to attend the annual stockholders meeting osgood was upheld in this opinion by the companys board of directors determined to attend the meeting gates hired a special train to get to the meeting in denver john osgood was prepared for gates arrival he had obtained a circuit court injunction barring gates and his associates from attending the meeting the doors of colorado fuel and iron were guarded by sheriffs deputies armed with shotguns gates was angry about being refused entry to the meeting but he became enraged when he learned he was described in the local circuit court as a high roller and a gambler gates returned to new york to try utilizing the federal court system there as the legal wrangles continued the stock of the company began dropping in value during this time gates lost us million but still was unsure of his legal status with colorado fuel and iron osgood announced he was willing to meet gates halfway but gates declined the offer he accused osgood of tampering with the courts and claimed that he would receive the legal ownership of the company he was due apparently feeling that a long battle was not worth it gates gave up the fight some weeks later and sold the shares which eventually wound up with the rockefeller familyk tennessee

southtennessee coal iron and railroad company and the slosssheffield iron and steel company in alabama all three were able to use inexpensive southern iron ore to produce quality steel with the open hearth process making the price of the steel produced with it cheaper the minerals needed for the open hearth process were readily found in alabama gates envisioned bringing republic tennessee coal and iron and slosssheffield together into a steel trust to challenge j p morgans u s steel when august belmont jr resigned his seat on republics board to concentrate on consolidating the new york transit system gates was elected to fill belmonts seatl gates found two likeminded members of the board when he began talking about consolidating the three steel companies one was l c hanna the brother of mark hanna the other was grant schley who had a wall street brokerage gates now began purchasing shares of tennessee coal and iron in preparation of the consolidation in january  he was ready to outline his plan to potential members of the trust with the exception of republics president a w thompson when thompson was advised of the scheme he declared there would be no such trust with republic as a member when put to a formal vote republics board members voted down the idea of joining a trust during this time gates was able to purchase enough shares of tennessee coal and iron to give him a controlling interest in the company gates was riding high with both republic and tennessee coal and iron doing well with more orders that both could fill his assessment of the openhearth

he believed the issue was serious enough to affect the nation however he would not release reports about the matter which were drawn by both the bureau of corporations and the department of justice senator charles allen culberson introduced a measure in the us senate demanding the release of this information when roosevelt countered that congress had no power to impel the executive branch of the us government to release information it had collected for its own use the senate chose to investigate roosevelts attorney general for failure to enforce the sherman antitrust act when it came to u s steel the resolution was approved but roosevelt still refused to release the reports claiming they were nobodys damn business the committee chose to continue the investigation without the reports  the

representative was both evasive and forgetful when questioned roosevelt who was in the process of leaving office was not censured for his actions because the senate committee was deadlocked  on this question the new york times wrote if the president had been less dear to americans it is likely there would have been such reluctance to revise his discretion in a difficult case this is an example of saying one man can steal while another is sent to jail for looking over the fence the verdict is not guiltybut dont do it again public ire about j p morgan and u s steels role in the events of  did

to husk a neighbors corn his next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor gates earned us for this job selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine as this type of equipment was very new at the time few farms owned one so gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms after one season gates tired of this type of work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend gates then set himself up as a local grain broker doing business from the familys home this business venture was a failure in an effort to escape farm work he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood the railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they

hardware store and while his partner tried to handle all the business he was not able to a son charles gilbert gates was born to gates and dellora on may   gates began to complain of various ailments soon after the babys birth at times he would take to his bed for some days with them business at the hardware store had become so bad gates was not able to afford the rent on the familys home they had to move into two rooms above the hardware store with gates saying he was too ill to help with the moving and packing while at the hardware store gates met a salesman who was in the barbed wire business as a result gates became interested in the relatively new product when he announced his intentions to sell his interest in the hardware store and become a traveling salesman for the product his wife and mother were both in favor of the plane he made a trip to san antonio texas in  where isaac ellwood hired him as a salesman for the washburnmoen barbed wire company after being assigned to work in texas gates quickly learned that while he found friends and poker playing companions when it came to selling barbed wire ranchers were not buying after watching a medicine show proprietor stage an elaborate presentation for his wares and noting that people fought to buy the products sold gates decided to have a similar production to demonstrate the merits of barbed wire in san antonios military plaza gates provoked cattle into charging into a barbed wire fence which did not break gates went from not being able to sell his product to not being able to fill orders quickly enough after the demonstration the barbed wire and steel businessedit upon ellwoods refusal to grant him a partnership in the company gates traveled to st louis missouri where in partnership with alfred clifford he started the southern wire company to compete with washburnmoen cliffords equipment to manufacture barbed wire had come from george c baker who had invented a machine for producing barbed wire which was similar but not identical to the one made by isaac ellwood baker had resisted all attempts by ellwood and washburnmoen to buy him out gates and clifford sold their product at a cheaper price than washburnmoen before long washburnmoen was losing substantial business to gates and cliffords southern wire company in an effort to stop the success of the former company salesman ellwood and washburnmoen filed for an injunction to stop the business of southern wire company the suit filed in u s district court claimed the machines gates and clifford used in the production of their product were a direct copy of those used by washburnmoen the suit also called for gates and clifford to pay us in damages to the company as they avoided process servers gates and clifford made a plan to save their company they were able to rent a building in east st louis illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory and onto a ferryboat after dark after they crossed the mississippi river the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the st louis u s district court and were back in business the next dayf when clifford and gates hired an attorney to answer the charges made against them in court the judge ruled that the manufacturing process used by southern wire company was not an infringement on any patents or machinery owned by ellwood and washburnmoen gates owned the sydney kent house at  south michigan avenue on chicagos south side from  to  the house is now listed on the national register of historic places after a fire destroyed the southern wire company gates gambled on the idea that william edenborn had not heard the news and approached him for a merger with the idea that southern wire would manufacture in edenborns now idle barbed wire plant the new company was known as st louis wire mill company they continued to buy other wire companies and had strong sales washburnmoen went back into court this time in des moines iowa where a federal judge ruled that the machinery created by baker was an infringement of washburnmoens patents by this time gates had created a syndicate of barbed wire manufacturers who did not produce their wares using washburnmoens methods the ruling in favor of washburnmoen only applied to areas in the jurisdiction of the u s federal court in des moines washburnmoen continued to falter isaac ellwood sent word asking for a meeting with gates ellwood and another key figure with washburnmoen john lambert now accepted offers from gates the barbed wire legal issues ended with washburnmoen selling their patent rights to gates and his syndicate of wire manufacturers through a series of mergers and acquisitions the company went through various name changes finally settling on american steel and wire company gates and his family moved to chicago where they lived for a period of ten years chicago attorney elbert henry gary had helped gates form the syndicate which led to the defeat of washburnmoen gary was called on again in  to negotiate a merger with j p morgans u s steel though he had provided gates with some loans and advice in the past morgan did not want gates to be a part of the merged company saying that there was only a deal without gates morgan made an offer to gates for the american steel and wire company telling him that he was not welcome to take part in the business of u s steeleither as part of management or on the companys board of directors morgan continued by saying that if gates did not accept his offer u s steel intended to build its own wire production plantg railroads oil and port

and james j hill of the northern pacific railway both men sought control of the chicago burlington and quincy railroad hill who was financed by j p morgan needed access to chicago harriman was interested in stopping hill from obtaining it gates saw this as an opportunity to get back at morgan for his refusal to seat him on the board of u s steel along with harriman he began buying shares of northern pacific stock when james hill noted a sudden rise in northern pacific stock prices he traveled to new york to consult with morgan morgan and hill stopped the sales of the northern pacific stock which remained high while other stocks took steep drops those who had been selling short could not obtain enough stock to cover themselves and were faced with large financial losses it was rumored that gates was short  shares of northern pacific stock gates did not confirm or deny any of the rumors about the railroad stock and would only say that he was doing well as gates continued to search for a way to get back at morgan for cutting him out of u s steel he found a vulnerability in morgans railroad holdings in  and began buying large numbers of shares in morgans louisville and nashville railroad when it was decided to add another short line to the ln system its board of directors voted to issue  new shares of stock to finance the new line a clerical error offered the stock

with the exception of republics president a w thompson when thompson was advised of the scheme he declared there would be no such trust with republic as a member when put to a formal vote republics board members voted down the idea of joining a trust during this time gates was able to purchase enough shares of tennessee coal and iron to give him a controlling interest in the company gates was riding high with both republic and tennessee coal and iron doing well with more orders that both could fill his assessment of the openhearth process for steel production was confirmed by a report from the us bureau of corporations the report stated that an agent for u s steel and a large railroad affiliated with j p morgan pronounced the rails produced by the openhearth process to be twice as good

iron company stock they found and indicated that the stock was not acceptable to them as securityno morgan proposed to buy tennessee coal and iron to rescue all involved with the company he outlined a plan whereby u s steel would change its second mortgage bonds for tennessee coal and iron stockp because the u s steel bonds were acceptable to the clearing house they would be able to be used for the debts it was suggested that president theodore roosevelt be consulted before such action was taken roosevelt was given only an outline of the issue he was never told which institution would fail without u s steels takeover of tennessee coal and iron roosevelt wrote a note to his attorney general stating he had not learned the name of the troubled business but felt that he should not object to this occurrence the new york times however printed its amazement that tennessee coal and iron stocks were not acceptable to the clearing house and that the trust company of america was deemed insolvent when it had more than enough assets to cover all deposits the newspaper concluded that u s steel wanted to take over a serious business competitor and the company was only worried about the

associates were accused of lying to roosevelt about the issue being serious enough to affect the united states roosevelt was chided for believing the lie roosevelt continued to state he believed the issue was serious enough to affect the nation however he would not release reports about the matter which were drawn by both the bureau of corporations and the department of justice senator charles allen culberson introduced a measure in the us senate demanding the release of this information when roosevelt countered that congress had no power to impel the executive branch of the us government to release information it had collected for its own use the senate chose to investigate roosevelts attorney general for failure to enforce the sherman antitrust act when it came to u s steel the resolution was approved but roosevelt still refused to release the reports claiming they were nobodys damn business the committee chose to continue the investigation without the reports  the new york times continued to follow the story and printed in a january  edition that a certain new york banker would testify that tennessee coal and iron was a stable company with giltedged stock values and

was both evasive and forgetful when questioned roosevelt who was in the process of leaving office was not censured for his actions because the senate committee was deadlocked  on this question the new york times wrote if the president had been less dear to americans it is likely there would have been such reluctance to revise his discretion in a difficult case this is an example of saying one man can steal while another is sent to jail for looking over the fence the verdict is not guiltybut dont do it again public ire about j p morgan and u s steels role in the events of  did not diminish when the senate hearing was ended in early   gates and his group of investors had previously provided the funding for new yorks luna park and its hippodrome  gates son charlie died in his sleep in his

soon after the babys birth at times he would take to his bed for some days with them business at the hardware store had become so bad gates was not able to afford the rent on the familys home they had to move into two rooms above the hardware store with gates saying he was too ill to help with the moving and packing while at the hardware store gates met a salesman who was in the barbed wire business as a result gates became interested in the relatively new product when he announced his intentions to sell his interest in the hardware store and become a traveling salesman for the product his wife and mother were both in favor of the plane he made a trip to san antonio texas in  where isaac ellwood hired him as a salesman for the washburnmoen barbed wire company after being assigned to work in texas gates quickly learned that while he found friends and poker playing companions when it came to selling barbed wire ranchers were not buying after watching a medicine show proprietor stage an elaborate presentation for his wares and noting that people fought to buy the products sold gates decided to have a similar production to demonstrate the merits of barbed wire in san antonios military plaza gates provoked cattle into charging into a barbed wire fence which did not break gates went from not being able to sell his product to not being able to fill orders quickly enough after the demonstration the barbed wire and steel businessedit upon ellwoods refusal to grant him a partnership in the company gates traveled to st louis missouri where in partnership with alfred clifford he started the southern wire company to compete with washburnmoen cliffords equipment to manufacture barbed wire had come from george c baker who had invented a machine for producing barbed wire which was similar but not identical to the one made by isaac ellwood baker had resisted all attempts by ellwood and washburnmoen to buy him out gates and clifford sold their product at a cheaper price than washburnmoen before long washburnmoen was losing substantial business to gates and cliffords southern wire company in an effort to stop the success of the former company salesman ellwood and washburnmoen filed for an injunction to stop the business of southern wire company the suit filed in u s district court claimed the machines gates and clifford used in the production of their product were a direct copy of those used by washburnmoen the suit also called for gates and clifford to pay us in damages to the company as they avoided process servers gates and clifford made a plan to save their company they were able to rent a building in east st louis illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory and onto a ferryboat after dark after they crossed the mississippi river the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the st louis u s district court and were back in business the next dayf when clifford and gates hired an attorney to answer the charges made against them in court the judge ruled that the manufacturing process used by southern wire company was not an infringement on any patents or machinery owned by ellwood and washburnmoen gates owned the sydney kent house at  south michigan avenue on chicagos south side from  to  the house is now listed on the national register of historic places after a fire destroyed the southern wire company gates gambled on the idea that william edenborn had not heard the news and approached him for a merger with the idea that southern wire would manufacture in edenborns now idle barbed wire plant the new company was known as st louis wire mill company they continued to buy other wire companies and had strong sales washburnmoen went back into court this time in des moines iowa where a federal judge ruled that the machinery created by baker was an infringement of washburnmoens patents by this time gates had created a syndicate of barbed wire manufacturers who did not produce their wares using washburnmoens methods the ruling in favor of washburnmoen only applied to areas in the jurisdiction of the u s federal court in des moines washburnmoen continued to falter isaac ellwood sent word asking for a meeting with gates ellwood and another key figure with washburnmoen john lambert now accepted offers from gates the barbed wire legal issues ended with washburnmoen selling their patent rights to gates and his syndicate of wire manufacturers through a series of mergers and acquisitions the company went through various name changes finally settling on american steel and wire company gates and his family moved to chicago where they lived for a period of ten years chicago attorney elbert henry gary had helped gates form the syndicate which led to the defeat of washburnmoen gary was called on again in  to negotiate a merger with j p morgans u s steel though he had provided gates with some loans and advice in the past morgan did not want gates to be a part of the merged company saying that there was only a deal without gates morgan made an offer to gates for the american steel and wire company telling him that he was not welcome to take part in the business of u s steeleither as part of

and james j hill of the northern pacific railway both men sought control of the chicago burlington and quincy railroad hill who was financed by j p morgan needed access to chicago harriman was

rumored that gates was short  shares of northern pacific stock gates did not confirm or deny any of the rumors about the railroad stock and would only say that he was doing well as gates continued to search for a way to get back at morgan for cutting him out of u s steel he found a vulnerability in morgans railroad holdings in  and began buying large numbers of shares in morgans louisville and nashville railroad when it was decided to add another short line to the ln system its board of directors voted to issue  new shares of stock to finance the new line a clerical error offered the stock

learned he was described in the local circuit court as a high roller and a gambler gates returned to new york to try utilizing the federal court system there as the legal wrangles continued the stock of the company began dropping in value during this time gates lost us million but still was unsure of his legal status with colorado fuel and iron osgood announced he was willing to meet gates halfway

slosssheffield iron and steel company in alabama all three were able to use inexpensive southern iron ore to produce quality steel with the open hearth process making the price of the steel produced with it cheaper the minerals needed for the open hearth process were readily found in alabama gates envisioned bringing republic tennessee coal and iron and slosssheffield together into a steel trust to challenge j p morgans u s steel when august belmont jr resigned his seat on republics board to concentrate on consolidating the new york transit system gates was elected to fill belmonts seatl gates found two likeminded members of the board when he began talking about consolidating the three steel companies one was l c hanna the brother of mark hanna the other was grant schley who had a wall street brokerage gates now began purchasing shares of tennessee coal and iron in preparation of the consolidation in january  he was ready to outline his plan to potential members of the trust with the exception of republics president a w thompson when thompson was advised of the scheme he declared there would be no such trust with republic as a member when put to a formal vote republics board members voted down the idea of joining a trust during this time gates was able to purchase enough shares of tennessee coal and iron to give him a controlling interest in the company gates was riding high with both republic and tennessee coal and iron doing well with more orders that both could fill his assessment of the openhearth process for steel production was confirmed by a report from the us bureau of corporations the report stated that an agent for u s steel and a large railroad affiliated with j p morgan pronounced the rails produced by the openhearth process to be twice as good at those made by the bessemer process which was used by u s steel the report went on to praise gates and his competitiveness the panic of edit in  gates took his usual summer holiday in europe upon arriving in paris he was met with an urgent cablegram from grant schley schley the owner of a brokerage and a board member of republic steel and tennessee coal and iron advised gates of serious

depositor he would still have us million in assets when the clearing house run by j p morgan audited the banks books they found the bank was sound but were quite interested in the tennessee coal and iron company stock they found and indicated that the stock was not acceptable to them as securityno morgan proposed to buy tennessee coal and iron to rescue all involved with the company he outlined a plan whereby u s steel would change its second mortgage bonds for tennessee coal and iron stockp because the u s steel bonds were acceptable to the clearing house they would be able to be used for the debts it was suggested that president theodore roosevelt be consulted before such action was taken roosevelt was given only an outline of the issue he was never told which institution would fail without u s steels takeover of tennessee coal and iron roosevelt wrote a note to his attorney general stating he had not learned the name of the troubled business but felt that he should not object to this occurrence the new york times however printed its amazement that tennessee coal and iron stocks were not acceptable to the clearing house and that the trust company of america was deemed insolvent when it had more than enough assets to cover all deposits the newspaper concluded that u s steel wanted to take over a serious business competitor and the company was only worried about the sherman antitrust act all of this had taken place before gates was able to return to new york when he was briefed on the situation he was told that all other members of the coalition had agreed to morgans terms q while gates realized he had no choice but to submit his shares of stock he insisted that all stockholders were to be treated equally with regard to the rate of exchange of their shares

long list of persons to subpoena for their testimony the first was john gates gates appeared to give his testimony on may   he was seriously ill and this was evident by how thin and pale he had become he planned a trip to paris to consult with doctors there after his testimony gates spoke of all of his dealings with j p morgan from the american steel and wire company to the louisville and nashville railroad and to the time when control of tennessee coal and iron company was wrested from him forcibly he left for paris while the committee was still in session the result of the hearings was an

antitrust act financial expert john moody wrote that if the panic was ended by this transaction it was ended by taking a few million from one pocket and putting millions into another morgans associates were accused of lying to roosevelt about the issue being serious enough to affect the united states roosevelt was chided for believing the lie roosevelt continued to state he believed the issue was serious enough to affect the nation however he would not release reports about the matter which were drawn by both the bureau of corporations and the department of justice senator charles allen culberson introduced a measure in the us senate demanding the release of this information when roosevelt countered that congress had no power to impel the executive branch of the us government to release information it had collected for its own use the senate chose to investigate roosevelts attorney general for failure to enforce the sherman antitrust act when it came to u s steel the resolution was approved but roosevelt still refused to release the reports claiming they were nobodys damn business the committee chose to continue the investigation without the reports  the new york times continued to follow the story and printed in a january  edition that a certain new york banker would testify that tennessee coal and iron was a stable company with giltedged stock values and

was both evasive and forgetful when questioned roosevelt who was in the process of leaving office was not censured for his actions because the senate committee was deadlocked  on this question the new york times wrote if the president had been less dear to americans it is likely there would have been such reluctance to revise his discretion in a difficult case this is an example of saying one man can steal while another is sent to jail for looking over the fence the verdict is not guiltybut dont do it again public ire about j p morgan and u s steels role in the events of  did not diminish when the senate hearing was ended in early   gates and his group of investors had previously provided the funding for new yorks luna park and its hippodrome  gates son charlie died in his sleep in his

to husk a neighbors corn his next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor gates earned us for this job selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine as this type of equipment was very new at the time few farms owned one so gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms after one season gates tired of this type of work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend gates then set himself up as a local grain broker doing business from the familys home this business venture was a failure in an effort to escape farm work he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood the railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they

provided the capital for stock to open a hardware store in turner junction at first the business went well gates and dellora were able to move into their own home gates began taking time away from the hardware store and while his partner tried to handle all the business he was not able to a son charles gilbert gates was born to gates and dellora on may   gates began to complain of various ailments soon after the babys birth at times he would take to his bed for some days with them business at the hardware store had become so bad gates was not able to afford the rent on the familys home they had to move into two rooms above the hardware store with gates saying he was too ill to help with the moving and packing while at the hardware store gates met a salesman who was in the barbed wire business as a result gates became interested in the relatively new product when he announced his intentions to sell his interest in the hardware store and become a traveling salesman for the product his wife and mother were both in favor of the plane he made a trip to san antonio texas in  where isaac ellwood hired him as a salesman for the washburnmoen barbed wire company after being assigned to work in texas gates quickly learned that while he found friends and poker playing companions when it came to selling barbed wire ranchers were not buying after watching a medicine show proprietor stage an elaborate presentation for his wares and noting that people fought to buy the products sold gates decided to have a similar production to demonstrate the merits of barbed wire in san antonios military plaza gates provoked cattle into charging into a barbed wire fence which did not break gates went from not being able to sell his product to not being able to fill orders quickly enough after the demonstration the barbed wire and steel businessedit upon ellwoods refusal to grant him a partnership in the company gates traveled to st louis missouri where in partnership with alfred clifford he started the southern wire company to compete with washburnmoen cliffords equipment to manufacture barbed wire had come from george c baker who had invented a machine for producing barbed wire which was similar but not identical to the one made by isaac ellwood baker had resisted all attempts by ellwood and washburnmoen to buy him out gates and clifford sold their product at a cheaper price than washburnmoen before long washburnmoen was losing substantial business to gates and cliffords southern wire company in an effort to stop the success of the former company salesman ellwood and washburnmoen filed for an injunction to stop the business of southern wire company the suit filed in u s district court claimed the machines gates and clifford used in the production of their product were a direct copy of those used by washburnmoen the suit also called for gates and clifford to pay us in damages to the company as they avoided process servers gates and clifford made a plan to save their company they were able to rent a building in east st louis illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory and onto a ferryboat after dark after they crossed the mississippi river the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the st louis u s district court and were back in business the next dayf when clifford and gates hired an attorney to answer the charges made against them in court the judge ruled that the manufacturing process used by southern wire company was not an infringement on any patents or machinery owned by ellwood and washburnmoen gates owned the sydney kent house at  south michigan avenue on chicagos south side from  to  the house is now listed on the national register of historic places after a fire destroyed the southern wire company gates gambled on the idea that william edenborn had not heard the news and approached him for a merger with the idea that southern wire would manufacture in edenborns now idle barbed wire plant the new company was known as st louis wire mill company they continued to buy other wire companies and had strong sales washburnmoen went back into court this time in des moines iowa where a federal judge ruled that the machinery created by baker was an infringement of washburnmoens patents by this time gates had created a syndicate of barbed wire manufacturers who did not produce their wares using washburnmoens methods the ruling in favor of washburnmoen only applied to areas in the jurisdiction of the u s federal court in des moines washburnmoen continued to falter isaac ellwood sent word asking for a meeting with gates ellwood and another key figure with washburnmoen john lambert now accepted offers from gates the barbed wire legal issues ended with washburnmoen selling their patent rights to gates and his syndicate of wire manufacturers through a series of mergers and acquisitions the company went through various name changes finally settling on american steel and wire company gates and his family moved to chicago where they lived for a period of ten years chicago attorney elbert henry gary had helped gates form the syndicate which led to the defeat of washburnmoen gary was called on again in  to negotiate a merger with j p morgans u s steel though he had provided gates with some loans and advice in the past morgan did not want gates to be a part of the merged company saying that there was only a deal without gates morgan made an offer to gates for the american steel and wire company telling him that he was not welcome to take part in the business of u s steeleither as part of

iron company stock they found and indicated that the stock was not acceptable to them as securityno morgan proposed to buy tennessee coal and iron to rescue all involved with the company he outlined a plan whereby u s steel would change its second mortgage bonds for tennessee coal and iron stockp because the u s steel bonds were acceptable to the clearing house they would be able to be used for the debts it was suggested that president theodore roosevelt be consulted before such action was taken roosevelt was given only an outline of the issue he was never told which institution would fail without u s steels takeover of tennessee coal and iron roosevelt wrote a note to his attorney general stating he had not learned the name of the troubled business but felt that he should not object to this occurrence the new york times however printed its amazement that tennessee coal and iron stocks were not acceptable to the clearing house and that the trust company of america was deemed

company stock was acceptable to morgans clearing house the company was valued at us million its stock had a par value of us per share tennessee coal and iron had been operating at peak capacity through that summer many u s steel plants had been idled and its common stock had dropped from   to    grant schley was once more pressured for payment he again offered his tennessee coal and iron stock as collateral and was told it would not be accepted by morgans clearing house schley was also told that if his brokerage failed oakleigh thornes trust company of america bank would also fail  the u s steel second mortgage bonds were quoted at  while shares of tennessee coal and iron were valued at   one of gates associates remarked that tennessee coal and iron stock withstood the panic and had never been quoted lower than us a share he went on to say that the panic was used as a ruse to get control of the company  j p morgan was initially hailed as a hero for putting an end to the panic a few months later the newspapers were writing different stories about the incident it was acknowledged that what was done with tennessee coal and iron stocks was a bold violation of the sherman antitrust act financial expert john moody wrote that if the panic was ended by this transaction it was ended by taking a few million from one pocket and putting millions into another morgans associates were accused of lying to roosevelt about the issue being serious enough to affect the united states roosevelt was chided for believing the lie roosevelt continued to state he believed the issue was serious enough to affect the nation however he would not release reports about the matter which were drawn by both the bureau of corporations and the department of justice senator charles allen culberson introduced a measure in the us senate demanding the release of this information when roosevelt countered that congress had no power to impel the executive branch of the us government to release information it had collected for its own use the senate chose to investigate roosevelts attorney general for failure to enforce the sherman antitrust act when it came to u s steel the resolution was approved but roosevelt still refused to release the reports claiming they were nobodys damn business the committee chose to continue the investigation without the reports  the new york times continued to follow the story and printed in a january  edition that a certain new york banker would testify that tennessee coal and iron was a stable company with giltedged stock values and that roosevelt had been misled hearings began on january  behind closed doors but reporters were able to determine enough of the events that took place to file news stories oakleigh thorne testified that his bank was not helped by the actions of morgan stock broker grant schley said his brokerage could have been assisted without demanding his tennessee coal and iron stock morgans representative was both evasive and forgetful when questioned roosevelt who was in the process of leaving office was not censured for his actions because the senate committee was deadlocked  on this question the new york times wrote if the president had been less dear to americans it is likely there would have been such reluctance to revise his discretion in a difficult case this is an example of saying one man can steal while another is sent to jail for looking over the fence the verdict is not guiltybut dont do it again public ire about j p morgan and u s steels role in the events of  did not diminish when the senate hearing was ended in early   gates and his group of investors had previously provided the funding for new yorks luna park and its hippodrome  gates son charlie died in his sleep in his

way look at you there back in  you handsome devil as part of our tribute lets take a quick look back at the top ten greatest and not so great products created on billtime shall we dont worry itll only sting a little hitsinternet explorer ie introduced its really easy to simply remember internet exploder as the standardsbreaking webforking buggy monopolycausing app that helped shape bills old image as the evilest baron of all technology companies but its also the app that led to the creation ajaxbased web apps through the xmlhttprequest spec and the kludgey early popularization of css love it or hate it ies gotten more people on the web over the years than any browser and thats definitely got to count for somethingmedia center introduced despite tivos dvr dominance and competitors that came and went over the years media center has always been an underrated standout product even bill admits that the companys long struggled with usability but media center is a beacon of hope not only for foot uis everywhere but also for the companys ability to create powerful advanced userfriendy products between its online integration extensible plugin architecture ability to stream shows to nodes around the house and now cablecard support the only real downside to media center is the fact that you still need a fullblown pc to run itmsdosintroduced  discontinued it was arcane and nighunusable to mere mortals  but the early cashcow was one of bills most strategic moves and helped microsoft define the concept of software licensing it also helped launched mossbergs career as crusader of userfriendly technology but most importantly msdos was still the os an entire generation grew up learning so del crticsm for a second because our autoexecbat and configsys were so very well crafted and extensively tweaking memmaker for a few extra kb of usable ram definitely ranks amongst our top most formative geek moments office introduced  on mac  on pc word excel and powerpoint certainly did well enough on their own but when microsoft combined em into the tidy and pricey package that is office  first on the mac in  interestingly  it had a selling point that would prove irresistible to many a productivityobsessed middle manager even today the addition of outlook and its support for the for some nighindispensable exchange only further solidified its foothold in the corporate computing world and thats where bill knew the real money was thats certainly not to say that it hasnt been without its share of problems and annoyances though  were looking at you clippyperipherals introduced microsoft has always been a software company first but its been cranking out highquality peripherals for over  years  long before the xbox and zune were even a twinkle in bills eye not only that but its been a reliable innovator in the field with a string of devices that were first early or just simply popularized technologies like the wheel mouse forcefeedback joysticks and controllers the modern optical mouse and the ergokeyboard the division has gone through some bumpy times  the sidewinder line was killed off for a while there and thereve been some questionable designs along the way  but its been riding high as of late and it doesnt show any signs of slowing down soon windows   nt  introduced  and  it took a few versions to come into its own but by the time windows hit  microsoft finally had a product that was able to pull pc users away from the command line for some of the time at least and give them a real taste of things to come windows nt may not have had quite the same appeal with the average consumer but it did bring the operating system into the bit world and pave the way for enterprise desktop computing as we know it today plus it had the nt file system ntfs which to this day continues to carry on the legacy in its own little way we really wish theyd made a sequel to the pirates of silicon valley because wed love to have seen the dramatization of bill overseeing the first popularized verions of windows  especially  which came out just a couple of years laterwindows  and xpintroduced when thinking of microsoft and the new millennium few people are able to keep the crinkles out of their nose thankfully windows me wasnt the only thing that arrived in late yk as windows  rushed in to rock the socks off of suits everywhere the whole wink thing went over so well that gates and company decided to base its next consumer os xp off of it some may argue that the resulting product still stands as the last great os to ship out of redmondwindows ce  mobileintroduced as two of the most ubiquitous projects to come out from under bills command both windows ce and windows mobile are almost impossible to avoid when it comes to handhelds or phones what began as a mishmash of small components has grown into the adaptable  though sometimes maddening  mobile os that resides on just about every kind of device you can think of really we mean every kind of device from pmps to enterpriselevel stockkeeping systems the slimmed down and restructured microwindows is at the very least one of the more flexible offerings the company has ever produced say what you will about its usability theres no denying the massive impact its had on portability and convergence xbox and xbox  introduced  and  back in  bill was all about multimedia convergence and he said that a new gaming  multimedia device would be microsofts trojan horse into the worlds living rooms with something coined the directxbox in  the original xbox entered gaming territory dominated by sonys playstation with nintendos n but the clunky machine brought with it the first easy to use multiplayer console service xbox live as well as a developercentric model that helped turn the tables of course things look quite a bit different today the xbox  leads the former market leaders playstation  in spend and attach rate and with the relative success of media and content sales on xbox live it seems bills dream of dominating the living room wasnt just a pipedream after allvisual basic introduced  discontinued its hard to underestimate the impact of visual basic while the average user might have never heard of the original vb that microsoft released way back when the simplicity of the language and its graphical toolset made just about any power user a potential app developer powering the flood of third party application development microsoft operating systems enjoyed throughout the s sadly visual basic met its demise at the hands of more modern languages and toolsets but with a legacy of making programming accessible to the masses its place in the history books and in bills pocketbook is undoubtedly securerunnersup directx flight sim portable media center solitaire and minesweeper misses auto pc introduced  discontinued  riding high on its previouslyintroduced sister products  the handheld pc and palm pc platforms now dead and transformed into windows mobile respectively  microsofts auto pc initiative was promised to herald a revolution for incar entertainment and productivity theres no question it was well ahead of its time in fact many of the features debuted in auto pc have gone on to become standard fare in todays cars problem was when it launched your ride was already pimped with a mere cd player incar navigation voice recognition and mp support were still the stuff of science fiction in those dark days particularly at the fourdigit asking price and the whole thing was doomed to a geeky spendy niche though products were initially expected from several manufacturers clarion ended up being the only one to actually produce a head unit the auto pc lived on in spirit as clarions joyride but microsofts heart was no longer in the project and clarion had switched to a generic windows cebased core to build the product microsoft bob introduced  discontinued  poor bob no one ever gave him a chance maybe it had to do with the fact that he was really annoying and as it turns out bill was dating melinda french bobs program manager which isnt to say there was any nepotism involved  bob suffered an early death in  due to general hatred for the little bastard bill offered this to a column in january  unfortunately bob demanded more performance than typical computer hardware could deliver at the time and there wasnt an adequately large market bob died thankfully billindas blossoming relationship lived on oh did you hear theyre like the worlds greatest philanthropists now cairo introduced  but never released ask folks to pick one word to describe microsofts technology roadmap in the s and youll commonly get cairo in response announced before windows nt  was even released cairo was occasionally an operating system occasionally a collection of new technologies  it depended entirely upon who and when you asked  but at its core it was intended to guide microsoft on the path beyond the architecture introduced by nt after throwing countless dollars and manhours at the ambitious project cairo was ultimately canned though mentions of the storied buzzword continued even into this decade although windows  eventually became nts heir apparent the fruits of microsofts labor werent entirely for naught as various cairo features found themselves implanted into various versions of windows throughout the years even the winfs file system can trace its roots back to the project  fitting because it too has become such an albatrossmsn music and urgeintroduced  and  both fully discontinued when msn music  microsofts effort to build its own playsforsurebased subscription music based store  imploded headstrong bill did what he usually does rebrand and launch again when he got up at ces  and announced msn music would become urge with mtv we were all a little skeptical  after all the problem wasnt really the service it was the overbearing drm and the fact that consumers simply werent ready for subscription music of course eventually urge died as well and mtv shunted customers to rhapsody america naturally microsoft had a third playsforsurebased store waiting in the wings with zune which doesnt appear to be going anywhere any time soonorigami  umpcintroduced note intel please join microsoft on stage to accept this awardumpcs what can we say sure scoble liked them but even from day one we never saw the market potential fueled by an early and toosuccessful hypegenerating viral campaign of microsofts own making there was no way that these first generation origami devices would achieve their promise overpriced underpowered desktop osladen with microsofts touch pack addon and poor battery life all helped ensure drown umpcs in the wave of ultramobile lifestyle pchysteria they rode to market and as umpcs begin to fade the shrinking niche between smartphones and laptops can look forward to the sweet release of mids  though thats already been two years and countingos dates introduced  discontinued what began as a collaboration between microsoft and thenpartner ibm blossomed into what looked like  for a time at least  the logical successor to the dos  windows empire the advanced os showed early signs of greatness with its incorporation of the hpfs file system improved networking capabilities and a sophisticated ui but cracks in the relationship between the two powerhouse corporations would ultimately lead to its downfall with windows  a sudden success ibms reluctance to go hardware neutral and microsofts increasing displeasure with code which it called bloated ahem the project was eventually swept aside by gates and the gang to make way for what would become the omnipresent operating system you know and love andor hate today spot watches and msn direct introduced  discontinued  when the concept of an informationenabled watch that automagically received content over unused fm radio subcarriers was first conjured up by microsoft in the early part of the decade it seemed like a fabulous idea so much so in fact bill personally took the project under his wing but by the time it had launched it was already doomed by a perfect storm of problems the devices were uglier than sin and comically oversized the bizarre ad campaign featured frighteningly hairy cartoon arms and  as the mobile web was just starting to pick up steam at that time  virtually anyone who wouldve been interested in that kind of product had already discovered ways to get the same information from their phone the underlying data network microsoft built out to support the watches msn direct lives on to this day and sees plenty of use in garmins nüvi line but will it ever be used to beam weather news and msft stock reports to wrists other than bills not bloody likelywindows activation introduced depending on who you talk to windows product activation is a serious privacy violation a headache minimal protection against piracy or all of the above lucky for us microsoft is finally seeing some of the folly of its overbearing ways and has gone with a more permissive nagware method with vista sp this as opposed to the regular method of routinely locking users out of their systems which wouldnt you know it tended to hurt legitimate users more than pirates perhaps the best example of windows activations legacy was the great wga outage of  which left  systems out in the cold due to a few downed servers at microsoft it didnt take long for the servers to bounce back but any shred of reputation the service had at that point went out the window with the uptimewindows meintroduced september its not exactly clear what the point of windows millennium edition was  our guess is that microsoft needed to keep up with that yearbased product naming scheme it had going at the time and cranked out this halfbaked update to  in order to capitalize on the turnofthemillenium frenzy unlike the ntbased windows  released at the same time windows me retained its msdosbased core while managing to somehow get even more slow and unstable than its predecessors  and  and to add insult to injury it restricted access to shell mode rendering many msdos apps incompatible thankfully windows me was only inflicted upon consumers for little over a year it was replaced by indomitable windows xp in windows vista introduced vista doesnt suck lets just get that off our chests in fact its a quite capable secure and sexy os when you get right down to it unfortunately its problems just loomed too large for many folks to overlook a multitude of delays and a rapidly diminishing feature list soured people right out of the gate and once the dust settled people just werent happy with the minor improvements they were getting in exchange for their hardearned monies and fairly mandatory ram upgrades mix that in with the standard driver incompatibilities of any microsoft os upgrade and youve got a whole bunch of disgruntled downgraders on your hands  and plenty of bad press to fill in any remaining gaps sadly improvements to media center aesthetics and even that quirky little sidebar got overlooked in the process microsofts already scrambling to get windows  together to capture the multitude of users thatve decided to skip vista altogether lets just hope its not too laterunnersup actimates pocket ie games for windows  live xenix yeah microsoft actually did a unix at one time m m
