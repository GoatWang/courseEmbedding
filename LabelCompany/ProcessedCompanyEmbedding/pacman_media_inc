specific purpose may vary and will depend on a number of factors nonfixed cost sales and marketing and general and administrative costs may vary depending on the business progress and development efforts general business conditions and market reception to our services accordingly our management has broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds to nonfixed costs an example of changes to this spending allocation for nonfixed costs include management deciding to spend less of the allotment on product development and more on sales and marketing if necessary mr evans our officer and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process but we will require funding of a minimum funding scenario displayed in our use of proceeds table therefore to implement our complete business plan if insufficient funds are raised we plan to borrow funds from our management however the agreement with mr evans to provide funding is nonbinding and there is no guarantee that he will provide such funding from our research we find that as of may  there were  million apps available for download from the apple store compared to  in june  so to us the market seems to be increasingly crowded and in order for our apps to stick out from the crowd they need to have superior and innovative design qualities the risks in this area are that our apps are not innovative enough to stick out in a crowd of  million also established competitors could launch a similar app in the same period and outperform us promotionally by aggressively marketing their product using their own established advertising strategies most ominously rivals with larger economies of scale could steal our idea and design an app with similar functions but superior design features all of this will have direct impact on our possible revenues and investors should strongly consider this risk before investing any money with pacman media company description pacman media is a new venture which intends to specialize in the creation of mobile apps applications to be used on mobile devices specifically smartphones and tablet computers the apps are planned to be designed using voice recognition software and their purpose is to make it possible to continue work on say a word document even if the user is away from their desktop computer therefore our apps meant to be specifically
