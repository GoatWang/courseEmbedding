injuries news press releases sexual harassment barratry  illegal case solicitation securities fraud advanced search do i need an auto accident attorney jarod cassidy days ago there are several factors to consider when deciding whether or not you need legal representation following an auto accident while every auto accident is unique there are several situations in which you should definitely consider contacting an experienced auto accident attorney when a serious injury or death occurred if you or a loved one was seriously injured or killed in an accident contact an attorney immediately

lost wages from the responsible party when a commercial vehicle is involved if you were involved in an accident that involved a commercial vehicle such as a delivery truck or an wheeler it is better to err on the side of caution accidents involving company vehicles can become complicated very quickly as company vehicles are subject to additional laws and regulations you need an attorney who has the experience and resources to navigate these complex cases when there is contested liability if there is any dispute about who caused the accident an attorney can help you make sure that any fault determinations are correct in texas civil litigation is decided on preponderance of evidence this means that a party found to be  liable or more is unable to recover damages additionally insurance companies will often dispute liability and assert their policyholder was not entirely responsible for a crash to mitigate payouts when an insurance company fails to offer a fair settlement if an insurance company is not offering a fair settlement it is time to contact an attorney insurance companies are in the business of making money – as such they will attempt to payout as little as possible if you believe you deserve more than what an insurance company is offering do not be afraid to seek legal representation when an insurance company ignores you some insurance companies will drag their feet and ignore your phone calls as a tactic the hope is that you will be so fed up with the process by the time they make an offer that you will accept a settlement that is less than what you deserve if you feel that an insurance company is ignoring you or attempting to delay the closure of your claim contact an attorney to apply pressure your claim was denied occasionally and insurer will attempt to deny a justified claim outright if you feel that your claim should be covered under a policy contact an attorney when you have questions if you are ever unsure about your rights following an accident or have questions about how you should proceed contact thomas j henry for a free consultation one of our experienced personal injury attorneys will review your case and help you

eklund days ago around  million takata brand replacement airbags that are set to be installed in vehicles may have to have to be replaced this was discovered after tests showed that  million of the replacement airbags were defective about the defective airbags nbc news reports that the national highway traffic safety administration announced that the new replacement airbags from takata were found to be defective the  million defective airbags that were tested and found to be defective contained a drying agent called calcium sulfate and the others contained zeolite the issue is that moisture has been getting into takata airbag inflators and this causes a potentially lethal ammonium nitrate compound to be released takata tried to remedy this problem by using a drying compound in the airbag inflators so it would lessen the possibility of the airbags exploding however experts are skeptical that this will solve this massive issue for the auto industry more details on the recall around  automakers have been affected by this recall including honda toyota and nissan who have stated that they will no longer be using takata inflators according to keiichi hori who oversees automotive safety components at the japan explosives society the compounds in the airbag replacements can reduce the chances of explosions but it can’t eliminate the possibility of it occurring while the original takata airbags killed at least  people and injured  others the replacement airbags with the new drying agents haven’t been linked with any deaths or injuries bike safety tips for kids

american academy of pediatrics has recommended that children under the age of  be restricted from atv use additionally riders have been urged to wear helmets refrain from taking passengers and to avoid roads in the face of these warnings the mortality rate from atv crashes involving children under  has remained consistent over the past few years in their study researchers examined data on

the us department of transportation reports that over the past  years  people have died and around  more were injured in work zone crashes they also reported that drivers are most frequently killed in work zone crashes in order to be prepared for avoiding accidents in work zones here are some quick tips to keep you safe on the road be alert while driving it’s easy to lose focus when you’re on a long road trip and you slowly become less aware of what’s going on around you you may enter a work zone quickly and all of a sudden the speed limit and traffic patterns have changed completely when you’re driving make sure that you’re always paying close attention to the road and the other cars around you in case you quickly approach a work zone don’t drive while distracted people make small movements to change the radio station or look for something in their car while driving while this may not seem like a big deal just a second or two of being distracted by something in your car can lead you to having an accident don’t look away from the road while changing radio stations while you’re driving and avoid trying to find various objects in your car also most importantly never text and drive a twoword text message isn’t worth the grief that will be felt by your loved ones after a distracted driving accident obey the speed limit it’s common for people to want to go a little faster than the speed limit while driving since it’s fairly common on highways however you should always drive at the speed limit because they have been put in place to show the safest speed at which you should drive on top of that if you speed in a work zone you may be fined heavily when you drive by a speed limit sign on the highway just take a quick glance at your speedometer to make sure that you’re driving at a safe speed be careful when merging there can be a lot of close calls with other vehicles when you’re merging into another lane blind spots in your rearview mirrors can put you in a dangerous situation if you don’t doublecheck if there are cars around you while you merge to avoid any accidents be very aware of the cars around you when you’re merging traffic patterns can change daily and sometimes merge signs come up sooner than you think so always check the signs around you while you’re driving also make sure that you’re that you’re merging when the paving markings show that you’re allowed to do so expect anything workers and vehicles might move around unexpectedly in a work zone and you need to always be on the lookout for any possible hazards vehicles might block off lanes on the highway or they may start putting cones in a lane that will force you to merge into another lane this is common in work zones so you should always expect something about traffic to be different when you’re entering one when can a school be held liable for a child’s injuries jarod cassidy days ago our children spend nearly a quarter of their waking hours on school property therefore it is not necessarily surprising that roughly  percent of all unintentional child injuries occur on or around school grounds as parents we have an innate desire to protect our children from harm and and we do everything in our power to shield our children from danger – but who is responsible for your child’s safety when he or she is at school and if a serious accident occurs who should be held accountable the answers to these questions are not necessarily as simple as they should be a question of negligence generally schools are expected to take reasonable measure to provide a safe environment for their students  this includes preventing harm caused by other students teachers or staff ensuring that there are no known structural problems with the school building or ground not allowing any person to enter the building without permission this does not mean however that schools are insurers of a student’s safety if for example a child should fall while running down a flight of stairs the school would not likely be liable as the incident was caused by the child’s actions instead whether a school is held accountable for a child’s injury normally comes down to a question of negligence did the school or a school official breach their duty of care to a student by creating an unsafe environment or by failing to address a known unsafe situation or condition common examples of negligence by a school if a child is injured while at school or on school grounds the school may be held accountable if school officials were aware of bullying incidents but did nothing to stop or prevent them necessary medication was not given to a student or medication was not administered properly cafeteria personnel failed to properly cook lunch items or served food that was not fit for human consumption a school was aware of damaged walls stairs or playground equipment but did not make the necessary repairs a school failed to enact adequate evacuation plans or ensure that fire alarms were working properly school personnel ignored security policies or did not notice a stranger entering the school without permission a child suffered injury could have been prevented had the child been under proper supervision who is accountable for my child’s injury most often we see a school as a single entity a building all under singular supervision in truth however it takes multiple parties to build and run a school there are outside contractors responsible for the building and maintenance of the building contractors responsible for barriers like fences third parties who provide janitorial services and food this means that if you child was injured on playground equipment while at recess the manufacturer of the equipment may be liable not the school if your child slips on a recently mopped floor that was not properly marked by janitor your claim may need to be filed against an outside contractor instead of the school district it is because issues like these that injuries suffered children in school settings are so complex such instances should not be taken lightly and should be addressed immediately         what is a duty of care jarod cassidy days ago establishing a duty of care is essential in proving negligence in a personal injury case beyond that an attorney must demonstrate that an individual or business breached their duty by performing an action that resulted in reasonably forseeable harm to others below are common questions clients may have concerning how duty of care relates to their case how does the law define a duty of care a duty of care requires that an individual adheres to a standard of reasonable care while performing any acts that could forseeably harm others this includes practicing the same watchfulness attention caution and prudence that a reasonable person would practice in similar circumstances when an individual’s actions do not meet this standard of care then the acts are considered negligent and the individual may be liable for any damages resulting from said actions a common example in which a duty of care is owed is when an individual is operating a motor vehicle as a motorist an individual owes a duty of care not only to other drivers but to all other road users this requirement can be traced back as far as  when boss v litton determined that “all persons paralytic as well as others have a right to walk on the road and are entitled to the reasonable care on the part of persons driving carriages upon it” when does a business owe a duty of care individuals are not the only ones who can owe a duty of care the law requires that the same standard be applied to business and organizations when certain relationships are established some examples of this are property owners – business owners have a duty to care to those who come onto their property however the length at which a property owner must go to protect visitors generally depends on the visitor’s status for example a trespasser will receive little or no care while customers are generally provided a high level of care manufacturers – a company that makes a product generally has a duty of care to the consumers who buy and use it this includes ensuring that the product is reasonably safe and properly warning consumers about and dangers the product may pose commercial trucking companies – commercial vehicle companies have a duty of care to their drivers and to all other persons on the road included in this duty of care is the duty maintain their vehicles’ vital parts in proper working order including brakes tires steering mechanisms and emergency equipment what constitutes a breach of duty when considering whether a defendant has breached his or her duty of care toward a plaintiff courts will often ask the following did the defendant owe a duty of care to the plaintiff if so was it a general duty of care or was the duty of care based on a special relationship such as professional liability medical liability or premises liability did the defendant fail to provide the same amount of care that a reasonable person would have provided in a similar position did the defendant foresee the risk of harm to the plaintiff if not should the defendant reasonably have foreseen the risk of harm were there alternatives available that may have prevented the harm of the plaintiff was the burden of using a safer alternative significantly higher than the risk involved in not using it while no single question can prove a breach of duty happened courts can consider all of these questions together to determine if when applied to the specific facts of a case they suggest a breach of duty occurred           what to consider when buying a crib jarod cassidy days ago a crib is one of the largest and most important purchases you will make when preparing for your child’s birth solidifying the fact that your baby is well on its way many soontobe mothers and fathers spend hours reviewing potential cribs for the perfect match to their child’s nursery however while you are stressing over the right size right style and right color don’t forget to consider your child’s safety proper spacing between slats wide slats can pose an entrapment hazard to your little one the consumer product safety commission says cribs should have no more than   inches between slats and corer posts don’t be afraid to bring a ruler with you when crib shopping corner posts should not be higher than end panels corner posts should be no more than  of an inch higher than end panels raised corner posts can catch on your babies clothing possibly posing a choking or entrapment hazard check for splits and cracks upon unboxing your baby’s crib check thoroughly for splits cracks chips and splinter stray pieces of wood can result in scratches punctures spinsters eye injuries and even choking hazards when detached from the rest of the crib make sure the mattress fits snugly in the crib when checking how a mattress fits use the two finger test if you can fit more than two fingers between the mattress and the crib the mattress is not a good fit and can pose an entrapment hazard bare is best do not put plush toys soft bedding or blankets in the crib medical professionals and organizations agree that a mattress with a tight fitted sheet is all that needed anything else can pose a suffocation hazard avoid bumper pads while bumper pads may seem like a reasonable safety product the american academy of pediatrics have determined that they increase the risk of sids and cribrelated death check for sharp edges or hardware thoroughly examine your crib for any sharp corners or protruding nuts and bolts a safe crib with have hardware that fits flush against the wood at least in areas that are within the child’s vicinity     top practice areas automobile accidents company vehicle accident lawyers trucking accidents injuries recalls malpractice quick links about the firm attorneys giving practice areas
