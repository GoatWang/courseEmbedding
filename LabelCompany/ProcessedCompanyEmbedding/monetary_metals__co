modern economy it is the worlds best conductor of electricity and heat best natural biocide and best reflector of light unlike other metals it is consumed in very small increments making recycling very difficult in other words once it  is used it is usually gone forever practically speaking at the same time it is generally an incidental cost in the products that use it – such that a dramatic increase in the price will not necessarily cause substitution a hint of shortages could cause industry users suddenly to hoard the metal and drain remaining available inventories investor demand is surging from  to  investors had been net sellers of silver in  we witnessed what appears to be a major sea change in the market the public again became net buyers in  demand for american eagles soared to a recordhigh of more than  coins – a number that would surely have been higher if demand had not completely overwhelmed the governmentrun mints production capabilities at times other government and private mints around the world have been cranking out coins rounds and bars at recordsetting levels the gold  silver ratio is currently around  which suggests silver is vastly undervalued the ratio of silver to gold in the earths crust is  – and the price ratio has hovered in that range for most of recorded history see graph if history is any guide the remaining bull market in precious metals could

government fiat money such as federal reserve notes diminishes savers and investors worldwide are embracing gold and silver as a store of value savvy investors are paying more attention to the declining purchasing power of the us dollar than ever before silver as an investment is silver a good investment wise investors are buying silver to preserve their wealth for the future the white metal has become a viable part of a robust investment profile precious metals such as gold bullion are used to accumulate wealth and hedge against inflation discover the reasons to invest in silver and how this popular commodity can be purchased why you should buy silver silver is unique because it is considered both a commodity and currency depending on how it is used precious metals such as gold and palladium can be purchased to guard against inflation while any investment is a risk silver has been used for centuries for a variety of purposes industries rely on it making it a solid investment choice as a vital industrial and monetary metal it has value around the world regardless of economic conditions it can be sold at current market prices as needed an investor can buy it in basic forms such as bullion bars coins and rounds investors typically purchase it by weight such the troy ounce pound gram or kilo it is priced by its weight in  fine silver if an item contains lower purity levels it may fetch slightly lower prices per troy ounce of the  silver it contains silver coins silver bullion coins are possibly the oldest type of coinage in history the use of these coins for trade dates back to the drachma used during greek times a collector purchases coins as a hobby and these coins may or may not have value coins sold by weight are purchased to store financial value for the future consider some of the products from which buyers can choose american eagle coins the american silver eagle coin is as wellknown as the famed gold krugerrands minted in south africa as legal tender coins they can technically be used as currency as well as for investment purposes buy silver eagles online or by phone the united states government mints american eagles as an investment they are also collectibles that can be used as a reward gift or incentive each american eagle contains at least one troy oz of  pure silver the notable design on its obverse is based on the “walking liberty” half dollar created by adolph a weinman in  canadian coins one of the most common canadian coins is the silver maple leaf each year the government of canada issues the canadian maple leaf bullion coin it is also legal tender with a face value in canada of about  canadian dollars the market value is determined based on the current spot price the standard coin weighs  troy ounce and contains  silver the obverse side of the maple leaf features elizabeth ii the reverse has the canadian maple leaf australian coins there are two major types of silver bullion coins from australia the kookaburra has been produced at the perth mint since  and is minted of  fine silver while the obverse always features queen elizabeth ii the reverse features a different kookaburra bird each year as a result these coins may have a slightly higher collectible value than some other bullion coins they are available in four sizes ranging from one troy ounce to  kilogram with face values from  to  the australian kangaroo is minted by the royal australian mint they have legal tender value in australia and the design changes annually which also gives them more numismatic value than other bullion coins introduced in  the australian kangaroo is a one troy ounce bullion coin it is issued as both an uncirculated bullion coin and a socalled “proof” coin junk silver older coins that have silver in them junk silver aka pre coins is an informal term to describe a circulated  silver dime quarter or half dollar that has the bullion value of the silver it contains this type of circulated coin has no collectible or numismatic value beginners and people who are looking to invest on a budget are often attracted to junk silver morgan and peace silver dollars morgan dollars are one of the most collected coins in united states history these large coins were produced between  and  they are part of americas westward development which gives them historical significance they were produced again in  there are many varieties making the morgan a challenge for collectors in  the silver peace dollar was released and produced until  while most morgan dollars are worth little more than their actual melt value despite what rare coin dealers attempt to argue those that are in nearly pristine condition can be considered collectible and carry a premium well above the spot price these coins represent peace liberty and power in america numismatic coins numismatic coins are different from bullion coins bullion investing is premised on inflation hedge survival and building wealth conversely numismatic coins are supposedly collectible numismatic coins are not produced in modern times and some of them are actually rare although most coins marketed as “rare” are not rare at all the truly rare coins are valued mostly on their collectible value rather than the silver content only experienced collectors should purchase any form of numismatic or rare coin as there are so many scammers out there taking advantage of novices even if you do happen upon a truly rare coin one should not expect to be able to sell them quickly or at a profit until much further into the future the bidask spreads are extremely high – sometime  or more do your own research or better yet only buy bullion coins bars and rounds that are priced based on their actual metal melt value rather than some highly subjective numismatic value what is a silver bullion bar silver bars are a type of bullion many investors decide to add them to their portfolios the silver is shaped into actual bars that are usually sold in troy ounces sometimes they are sold in gram or fractional ounce sizes too these bars can be purchased in various ways including online and at local shops silver bar sizes bar sizes are typically oneounce  oz  oz and  oz there are also large  ounce bars smaller bars actually cost more per ounce because the fabrication costs are higher per ounce of metal it is more cost effective for mints to produce larger bars and as a result they cost less per ounce however larger bars may be somewhat difficult to handle or store start your investment small with the  oz silver bar or the  oz silver bar here what are silver rounds silver rounds are coinshaped but are minted privately they are commonly referred to as rounds rather than coins because the word coin refers to circulating legaltender currency issued by the government rounds bear a variety of designs they can also be engraved to use as gifts or for military commemoration they do not have a face value and cannot be used as legal tender usually they weigh  troy ounce and contain  silver rounds tend to be a very costeffective way to accumulate ounces when compared to coins walking liberty money metals exchange has commissioned the creation of a proprietary round design loosely based off of the us mint’s walking liberty silver half dollar from  to  this cent piece was designed by adolph a weinman it depicted liberty walking toward the sun art historians have deemed it to be one of the most attractive united states coins a modification of this design has been used on the obverse of the american eagle since  our privately minted rounds are branded with our company name and do not bear markings that would create confusion that the round is an actual legaltender coin instead it is a lower price way to accumulate attractivelooking silver ounces money metals has these rounds in one ounce halfounce quarterounce and tenthounce sizes buffalo rounds buffalo rounds are also  troy ounce and contain  pure silver they typically feature the design from the american buffalo nickel these attractive rounds represent a important slice of american history they also have an image of the native americans private mints across the country produce buffalo rounds each year generic rounds there is a wide variety of generic rounds minted by private mints across the world for example they are made to celebrate holidays or as commemorative coins for service providers such as the armed forces as rounds they are not legal tender generic rounds general have a weight of  troy ounce of  silver medallions medallion is another word for a round medallions can be used to add silver to an investment portfolio or as collectibles some can be custom engraved to celebrate a certain occasions such as birthdays graduations holidays and more investing in silver vs gold market watchers usually keep track of the price of gold along with the sp  the dow and the price of crude oil an increasing number of market watchers are keeping an eye on silver especially since the surge in prices since  both silver and gold appear volatile when priced in the volatile us dollar but they are important financial insurance and potentially profitable the initial cost and ultimate sale price of gold is many multiples higher than silver however silver is accessible to everyone from beginners on a budget to seasoned investors both are key investments that can help hedge against inflation and financial turmoil traders often analyze the goldsilver price ratio compared to gold silver prices tend to be more volatile for those who prefer not to hold actual silver or gold precious metals can be purchased through exchangetraded funds etfs but this should not be considered as safe as owning actual bullion directly because of the counterparty risk involved in etfs silver is an especially attractive investment option because it is used for many traditional industrial purposes ranging from electrical appliances to solar panels and even clothing gold has a few industrial uses but is usually considered a luxury purchase such as gold jewelry owning both of these precious metals is a good way to balance an investment portfolio silver bullion mints bullion mints manufacture coins rounds and bars the history of coins ties in closely with the history of mints the first coins were hammered and production was slow and difficult now these sophisticated industrial facilities can produce hundreds of millions of coins bars and rounds mints produce the silver coins used for investment and currency purposes silver ira by simply opening up a new plan with a selfdirected ira provider you own physical silver inside of your retirement account precious metals can be purchased in various
