ft clamp on earth tester the hioki ft clamp on earth tester available for multiple grounding use this product was developed specifically to meet the needs of customers in north america europe and asia where there is high demand for multiple grounding measurements thanks to the small size of the clamp sensor the ft delivers a new level of convenience especially when used in confined locations at the same time the size of the grip used to open the sensor allowing the new meters to be operated with only half the force required for similar products offered by other companies advanced features compact clampon sensor for ultimate convenience in confined locations to date grounding resistance testers from other manufacturers have been characterized by their heavy weight and large jaws which complicate use of the instruments due to the difficulty of attaching them to ground wires responding to resulting demand for more compact sensors hioki engineered a lowprofile sensor just  mm wide for both instruments so that they can be used to measure ground wires that have been installed in cramped spaces the sensor is  percent smaller by volume than sensors on existing competing products larger sensor grip for improved workability hioki has enlarged the clamp sensors grip so that it can be opened with just two fingers enabling it to be operated with only half the force of existing competing products low power consumption for extended use the ft uses approximately half the power of competing products maximizing work efficiency because they can be continuously used for longer periods of time onboard storage for  data points the ft can store  data points each including a grounding resistance value and a current value in the field hioki ft datasheet  specifications   fill out the form

website bluetooth® is a trademark of bluetooth sig inc and licensed for use by hioki ee corporation   description the ft measure grounding resistance simply by clamping to multiplegrounded ground wires no auxiliary grounding rod is needed and there is no need to disconnect the ground wire from the grounding rod the compact lowprofile sensor can be used to clamp ground wires with ease and also provide ac current measurement functionality and can measure currents ranging from leakage current on the order of several ma to load currents of up to  a cat iv v key features • earth resistance measurement for multigrounded systems • measure leak current with absolute certainty with highly sensitive  ma resolution at  ma range • measure load current up to  a range • clamp at the narrowest point • data transfer to android™ phones using bluetooth® wireless technology ft • real time data transfer automatic report generation on android™ phone ft product video basic specifications accuracy
