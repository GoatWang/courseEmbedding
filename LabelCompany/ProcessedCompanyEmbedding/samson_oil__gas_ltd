via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is managements discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected aspects of our financial position and the results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying condensed financial statements you should read this in conjunction with the discussion under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the audited financial statements for the year ended june   included in our annual report on form k and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein throughout this report a barrel of oil or bbl means a stock tank barrel stb and a thousand cubic feet of gas or mcf means a thousand standard cubic feet of gas mscf overview we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition exploration exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties our strategy is to focus on the exploration exploitation and development of our major oil plays  the madison group reservoirs in the williston basin in williams and mckenzie counties north dakota and roosevelt county in montana in march  we closed on an acquisition the foreman butte acquisition of certain assets located in north dakota and montana which we refer to as the foreman butte project for a purchase price of  million the acquired assets consist of producing oil and gas wells shut in wells and associated facilities the wells are located in the madison and ratcliffe formations the majority of these wells will be operated by us however there are a number of nonoperated wells also included in this package our net oil production was  barrels of oil for the quarter ended march   compared to  barrels of oil for the quarter ended march   our net gas production was  mcf for the quarter ended march   compared to  mcf for the quarter ended march   coupled with the decrease in production following our north stockyard sale one of our significant gas wells has been down since october  while undergoing workover operations it appears these workover operations have not been successful and the operator is recommending that this well be plugged and abandoned we do not have an expected timetable for this operation as yet associated gas produced in the foreman butte project area is not as significant as the oil production therefore the acquisition has not offset decline from the sale our net oil production was  barrels of oil for the nine months ended march   compared to  barrels of oil for the nine months ended march   production has increased as a result of our acquisition of the foreman butte project and our subsequent workover activity in this project area this activity offset the decrease in production as a result of the sale of the north stockyard property which closed on october   our net gas production was  mcf of gas for the nine months ended march   compared to  mcf of gas for the nine months ended march   coupled with the decrease in production following our north stockyard sale one of our significant gas wells has been down since october  while undergoing workover operations it appears these workover operations have not been successful and the operator is recommending that this well be plugged and abandoned we do not have an expected timetable for this operation as yet associated gas produced in the foreman butte project area is not as significant as the oil production therefore the acquisition has not offset decline from the sale of the north stockyard project area for the three months ended march   and march   we reported a net gain of  million and a net loss of  million respectively the small gain in the current period reflects  million in depletion and amortization and  million in gain on derivative instruments while the loss in the prior period reflects a  million in depletion amortization and impairment for the nine months ended march   and march   we reported a net loss of  million and a net loss of  million respectively the loss in the current period reflects  million in depletion and amortization while the loss in the prior period reflects a  million in exploration expenditure and impairment expense of  million see results of operations below in the execution of our strategy our management is principally focused on economically developing additional reserves of oil and on maximizing production levels through exploration exploitation and development activities on a costeffective basis notable activities and status of material properties during the quarter ended march   and current activities acquisition producing properties foreman butte project mckenzie county north dakota mississippian madison formation williston basin samson  operated average working interest we are continuing with our workover operations to return several shutin wells back to production in the foreman butte project a fluidlevelproduction efficiency study has been completed on all the wells in the field to optimize well pump efficiency we have discovered that many of the wells have subperforming pump stroke lengths andor improperly sized pumping units as evidenced from highfluid levels located inside the wells concurrently a number of wells with behindpipe pay zones have been identified as recompletion candidates during the current quarter we commenced the first of the identified recompletion targets the davidson  a vertical wellbore in williams county was perforated in the ratcliffe zone of the madison formation the initial  hour production rate after perforating was  bop additional recompletions and well optimizations are scheduled for the upcoming quarter that may add to the production from this project additionally two new horizontal laterals are currently being planned to be drilled out of the maris h wellbore this spring the first will test the ratcliffe formation of the mississippian madison group the second will test the mission canyon formation of the mississippian madison group the lateral in the ratcliffe formation will help define the pressure depletion radius from the existing producing wellbores which will ultimately determine the number of puds proven undeveloped drilling locations we can drill in this reservoir thirdparty pressure modelling of the ratcliffe reservoir shows that relatively high reservoir pressure resides approximately  feet away from the maris  surface location it is estimated that this new lateral could produce at around  bopd if the thirdparty pressure modelling proves to be correct the second lateral in the mission canyon formation will test an undeveloped reservoir that could prove up a new oil field with the potential for many additional well locations these are expected to be drilled in the third quarter of calendar  undeveloped properties exploration activities hawk springs project goshen county wyoming permopenn project northern dj basin samson  working interest following a delay due to bad weather in the latter part of  the recompletion of the bluff  well has been further delayed due to our current focus on more capital efficient projects in the foreman butte project area the jurassic canyon springs formation will be perforated and flow tested first if this is unsuccessful the cretaceous dakota formation will subsequently be perforated and flow tested this well will be plugged and abandoned should these two operations be unsuccessful spirit of america us  well samson  working interest this well was plugged and abandoned during the second quarter of fiscal  cane creek project grand  san juan counties utah pennsylvanian paradox formation paradox basin samson  working interest on november   we entered into an other business arrangement oba with the utah school and institutional trust lands administration sitla covering approximately  grossnet acres located in grand and san juan counties utah all of which are administered by sitla we were granted an option period for two years in order to enter into a multiple mineral development agreement mmda with another company who hold leases to extract potash in an acreage position situated within our project area in november  we paid an extension fee of  in order to extend the option period to december  in november  we paid a further extension fee of  to extend the option period to december  the mmda has been finalized and is awaiting signature by both parties upon entering into the mmda sitla is obligated to deliver oil and gas leases covering our project area at cost of  per acre to us this acreage is located in the heart of the cane creek clastic play of the paradox formation along the cane creek anticline the primary drilling objective is the overpressured and oil saturated cane creek clastic interval keys to the play to date include positioning along the axis of the cane creek anticline and exposure to open natural fractures the d seismic is currently being designed to image these natural fractures the seismic shoot was surveyed and permitted this past summer while we can make no assurances we believe this project has the potential to provide robust economics in a low priced oil environment using the evidence obtained from a nearby competitor well that has produced  barrels of oilbo in just

of expected costs to drill and complete the first well to the vendor for the first development well to be drilled in the rainbow project samson has assessed the project based on offset well data and believes that the project will support  wells  in the middle bakken and  in the first bench of the three forks these wells would be expected to be configured as northsouth orientated  foot horizontals in the western drilling unit of the acquired acreage we hold a  working interest in the eastern drilling unit our interest is  continental resources has been designated as operator due to their larger

production oil production increased from  barrels for the three months ended march   to  for the three months ended march   this increase was due to our foreman butte acquisition which was completed in april  this project added  barrels of oil to our production total for the three months ended march   compared to nil for the three months ended march   this increase was offset by the decrease in production associated with the sale of the north stockyard project which was completed on october   the north stockyard field contributed  of the revenue during the quarter ended march   compared to nil for the quarter ended march   the realized oil price also increased from  per bbl for the three months ended march   to  per bbl excluding the impact of derivatives for the three months ended

months ended march   to  per bbl excluding the impact of derivatives for the nine months ended march   following a recovery in the global oil price gas revenues decreased from  million for the three months ended march   to  million for the three months ended march   due to the timing associated with receiving gas revenue checks approximately  million of gas revenue recognized in the march  quarter related to production periods prior to january  the production associated with this revenue was  mcf this decrease in the revenue recognised for the current quarter is due to a decrease in gas production which has offset an increase in the realized gas price production decreased from  mcf for the quarter ended march   to  mcf for the quarter ended march   the decrease in production was primarily due to the sale of the north stockyard project area which was completed on october   the foreman butte acquisition has not added significantly to the gas production as the wells in the acquisition area do not have a high gas content the decrease in production was offset by an increase in the realized gas price from  per mcf for the quarter ended march   to  per mcf for the quarter ended march   gas revenues decreased from  million for the nine months ended march   to  million for the nine months ended march   this decrease is due to a decrease in gas production which has offset an increase in the realized gas price production decreased from  mcf for the nine months ended march   to  mcf for the nine months ended march   the decrease in production was primarily due to the sale of the north stockyard project area which was completed on october   the foreman butte acquisition has not added significantly to the gas production as the wells in the acquisition area do not have a high gas content the decrease in production was offset by an increase in the realized gas price which increased slightly from  per mcf for the nine months ended march   to  per mcf for the nine months ended march   sale of assets for the three months ended march   we recognized  million in sale costs following the completion of the post settlement reconciliation with the purchasers of the north stockyard property these expenses related to invoices received after the settlement of the sale but relating to time periods prior to the effective date of the sale for the nine months ended march   we recognized  million in income from sale of assets as a result of the sale of our north stockyard property as at the sale date the value of the property was  million and  million in asset retirement obligation the sale value of the property was  million and we recognized  million in income from sale of assets after taking into account costs associated with the sale exploration expense exploration expenditures for the quarter ended march   and march   were less than  for either quarter exploration expenditures decreased from  million for the nine months ended march   to  million for the nine months ended march   exploration costs in the current period relate to general exploration expense exploration costs in the prior period related to previously capitalized exploration expenditure written off in relation to our hawk springs project in wyoming and wells drilled in this project area with the continued weak oil price exploration expenditure has been significantly reduced leases have been let go as they expire or delay rental payments not made causing the leases to expire impairment expense during the three months ended march   we recognized  million in impairment expense compared to nil million during the quarter ended march   the impairment expense recognized in the prior quarter relates primarily to our rainbow field and was driven by the sustained decrease in the oil price witnessed during the first quarter of  calendar year during the nine months ended march   we recognized  million in impairment expense compared with  million in impairment expense for the nine months ended march   the impairment recognized in the current period relates to a write down in the value of oil inventory held on the balance sheet related to our accounting policy of the holding inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value the impairment recognized in the prior period relates mainly to our north stockyard property and was a result of the sustained decrease in the global oil price lease operating expense lease operating expenses loe increased from  million for the quarter ended march   to  million for the quarter ended march   costs per boe excluding the impact of the workovers and production taxes were  a barrel costs have increased from  for the quarter ended march   due to increased salt water disposal costs in our foreman butte project area the wells in the foreman butte project area are also older wells than those we have previously owned and require additional fresh water and hot oil cleanouts which increase in the operating costs of the wells we are continuing to review our lease operating expenses and will shut wells in that are not economic to produce in the current oil pricing environment we are also reviewing our salt water disposals options in order to ensure we are minimizing costs lease operating expenses increased from  million for the nine months ended march  to  million for the nine months ended march   for similar reasons to those disclosed above for the three months ended march   costs per boe have increased from  for the nine months ended march   to  for the nine months ended march   excluding the impact of workovers loe and production taxes for the period ended march   was  per boe depletion depreciation and amortization expense depletion depreciation and amortization expense decreased from  million for the quarter ended march   to  million for the quarter ended march   the decrease in depletion is a result of the increase in the reserve base over which depletion is

expense decreased from  million for the nine months ended march   to  million for the nine months ended march   the decrease in depletion is a result of the increase in the reserve base over which
