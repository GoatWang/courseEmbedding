thematic pavilion one of the largest pavilions in the park presence in different marketsedit seat  the first model exported by seat in  to colombia became the bestselling car in finland from  to  in its  years there was only a short period from  to  when the firm produced its cars exclusively for the domestic spanish market in  and in a rather symbolic move the company exported some  units of its seat  model destined for colombia by air freight for the first time until two years later in  seat reached a deal over the renegotiation of its licence contract with fiat which allowed the spanish firm to form an international distribution network for its cars and thereafter start its export operations massively to more than twelve different countries entering the export market in  until the early s however most seat exports were sold with fiat badging as a response to seats bid for independence fiat committed themselves to selling  seatbuilt cars a year from  compared to  the year before at the end of  just after seat had won its legal battle with fiat a quarter of the production went to egypt and latin america in europe they were represented in west germany belgium france italy austria and greece the uk ireland and various scandinavian markets were planned to be added in  this was in spite of the company only being able to export the ronda with the fura to follow to date the company has launched its own models in more than  countries worldwide in accordance with the development policies of the volkswagen group with almost threequarters of its annual production representing exports for the markets out of spain its core market remains europe while the most successful market outside of europe in terms of sales for seat is currently mexico where the company has dealer presence in  mexican states in europe the brand has been launched in almost  countries across northern western southern eastern europe and russia seat today also sells its cars in  countries in asia mostly in the middle east and the arabian peninsula in  countries in americas including north america the caribbean sea central america and south america and finally africa mainly in north africa some of its cars have been sold outside europe branded as volkswagens such as the seat ibiza hatchback known in south africa as the volkswagen polo playa the seat inca panel van as the volkswagen caddy or the seat córdoba also known as the volkswagen polo classic in the years to come seat plans expanding in even more markets the most crucial of them all being china while in the past seat held talks with the chinese car maker faw in order to form an alliance for the local production of seat models in chinalocated plants the present project to enter the chinese market comprises in  first to start selling its range with cars produced in seats spainlocated martorell plant followed later in a second phase by the local assembly of seat models in china seats further expansion plans in more markets outside of europe have yet to be realised in the past the company was considering a possible launch in the united states although this move has never been carried out rumours also of a seat model being sold as a volkswagen in canada and the united states to supplement the volkswagens brand lineup there have occasionally circulated but have always been unsubstantiated and ultimately proven to be false in the past other market areas where the brand was also present for a short time were australia and new zealand from  to  as well as south africa from june  to the end of  however the brand was withdrawn from those markets due to volkswagens decision citing that current and expected circumstances made the ongoing importation of a niche brand nonviable seat has been present in the russian federation since  in india all volkswagen group brands are assembled or imported except seat historyedit establishment of seatedit spain is the worlds eighth largest producer of automobiles and its car market stands among the largest in europe however this has not always been the case in the first half of the th century spains economy was relatively underdeveloped compared to other western european countries and had a limited automobile market in this period there was only limited car production and only a few low volume local manufacturers catering mainly to the luxury end of the market of which hispanosuiza was the most successful spains limited market for massproduced vehicles was taken over by foreign companies operating through subsidiaries that either imported cars or assembled cars from imported parts depriving the country of the technological knowhow and large investments needed for mass production the situation greatly deteriorated with the spanish civil war of  to  car demand collapsed not only due to the greatly reduced purchasing power of spaniards caused by war devastation but also because the multinational subsidiaries either ceased operations or were severely stricken by the war and its aftermath seats first emblem the lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weakened post civil war spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests seat dates its origins back to june   when the spanish bank banco urquijo with the support of a group of industrial companies hispanosuiza basconia durofelguera se de construcción naval euskalduna se de construcciones metálicas fundiciones bolueta echevarría etc founded the sociedad ibérica de automóviles de turismo siat with the goal of establishing spains own mass production car maker the initial banco urquijos project aimed at running the siat motor company as a fully private enterprise but soon after  the interventionist state holding company instituto nacional de industria ini following a decision taken by the franco government on january   the goal for the new national car brand was not to be only another licensee car maker assembling foreign designs and parts in spain but of developing the whole manufacturing process from design to assembly within spain because of the countrys lack of expertise in automotive massproduction development it was decided to find a foreign partner who would contribute technically and with its own models in the early years in exchange for cash shares bonds and royalties with the rest of europe having entered the world war ii and spain itself in ruins from its civil war the project was delayed but not abandoned due to its strategic importance josé ortizechagüe puertas seats first ever president was in  made honorary president for life seat under its current name was founded on may   under the denomination sociedad española de automóviles de turismo sa seat by the instituto nacional de industria ini with a starting capital of  million pesetas — equivalent today of almost  million euros — in the form of  thousand shares of one thousand pesetas each and in a time when the country was in need of remodelling the fundamental structures in its national economy just after the end of the world war ii the birth of seat came almost a year and a half after the spanish government and six spanish banks banco urquijo banco español de crédito banesto banco de bilbao banco de vizcaya banco hispanoamericano and banco central had signed on october   an alliance contract with the italian car manufacturer fiat so as to form a partnership with a foreign ally in order to bring to life spains major car manufacturer the favoured bidders were germanys volkswagen and italys fiat fiats bid won for several reasons including fiats prominence in spain and the fact that the company established the shortlived fiat hispania plant in guadalajara which was destroyed in the spanish civil war fiats collaboration with the french company simca proved fiats ability to manage complex international projects fiats experience in the semiprotected car market in italy was seen as the most easily transferable to the one in spain both of which had at the time customers of low incomes and limited markets for cars as well as similar road conditions in italy fiat dominated the market for vehicles under  horsepower which would initially be the main market segment in spain the relative economic isolation of world war ii damaged italy and made fiat interested in opportunities outside italy meaning that the negotiations with the italian manufacturer could prosper more easily in favour of spanish interests than with those from other countries in  the banco urquijo group had revived the siat project and in the next year the talks ended successfully with the signing of a threepart contract with the understanding that the ini would hold a  controlling interest as well as a ruling act in the new company preserving a focused approach of the enterprise in the national interest the banco urquijo group although a minority share holder looked forward to assuming a leading role in the future as soon as the company was privatesed partner car maker fiat was offered a  share in exchange of its technical assistance this way seat not only would be able to reinitiate the countrys economic recovery and as the largest employer in the s and s but would also contribute to the industrialisation of what was still a largely rural eoconomy seats barcelona zona franca site and laboratories even though there were initial thoughts of locating in less developed inland cities like valladolid and burgos it was decided that the companys plant would be constructed in the dutyfree zone area of the port of barcelona barcelona zona franca which would offer better access to the mediterranean shipping and the rest of europe through rail and road connections across the nearby french border barcelona was after all a city with an industrial history that had built up expertise in complex industrial enterprises since the latter part of the th century it was also the host location of many early historical spanish car makers like hispanosuiza and elizalde and subsidiaries of foreign car makers like ford motor ibérica and general motors peninsular being an enterprise of vital interest for the national economy as well as an investment opportunity for fiats expansion plans through the iberian peninsula seat benefitted from state tariff and tax exemptions and technical assistance from its foreign partner fiat the company’s first president was the industrial and aeronautical engineer pilot and photographer josé ortizechagüe puertas who came from the spanish aircraft manufacturer construcciones aeronáuticas sa where he had held the position of ceo and who in  was meant to be named the honorary lifetime president of seat partnership with fiatedit seat  the first model produced by seat in  the construction works for seats zona franca plant began on  and the opening day came three years later on june   while in the meantime since  the spanish marque was starting preparations for setting up almost from scratch an entire supplier industry background the first car in the marques history to be produced was a seat  model that came off the production line on november   with licence plate b in the following few months the plants production output and workforce would significally increase together with the implementation of locally made components in the production process in order to limit imports from one part and from another part to push to the development of the almost nonexistent spanish supplier industry and meet seats assigned key role as the national car maker in restoring the spanish economy of the post world war ii spain by  the use of spanishmade parts had risen to  of the total and next year on may   the factory was officially opened nevertheless the impact to the spanish society could not be seen clear immediately since the first model launched by seat was considered a luxury car therefore it was highly priced and still not affordable to the average spanish consumer consequently seat needed a second more economical model to compete against simpler inexpensive designs that appeared in the local market like the biscúter which seemed to suit better to the unwealthy customers looking for a personal mean of transport in a suffering economic environment until the time seat had the technical maturity and expertise to present its first selfdeveloped model the seat  sport in  in its beginnings the company had to manufacture either rebadged or restyled models borrowed from the range of its italian partner fiat automobiles or even redeveloped them according to the needs of its own range however the first example of a seat exclusive derivative would arrive already on september  with the launch of the seat  a car which was developed inhouse by seat with no equivalent model in fiats range on the basis of the seat  as a stretched version with doors a monument in spain for the seat  a symbol of the spanish miracle in  seat founded the seat training centre in the greater zona franca plant area an institution covering the training of qualified personnel and serving the needs of the automobile industry in specialized technical human resources in that same year was launched the historical seat  which proved to be the crucial car that literally motorized spain being the first car for many spanish families and becoming a symbol of the spanish miracle as the growth of the annual production was hitting one record after another due to the heavy demand the economies of scale achieved would permit cutting costs and prices subsequently renew demand and boost sales together with profits for seat on june   the brand opened its new headquarters in madrid which hosted the firms sole — up to  — general administration offices in barcelona was found only seats plant manager until  a year when seat settled in catalonia another general direction seat  sport launched in  it was the first coupé model from seat in  fourteen years after producing cars for the domestic market seats success was signaled by its dominant position in spain ahead of its major competitors ie fasarenault citroënhispania authi and barreiros making seat the spains largest automaker in sales numbers and a wholly localized production in that year an agreement between fiat and the spanish ministry of industry was reached so as to put an end in the restrictions over exporting seat cars out of spain a term of the original licensee contract agreed with fiat in  in exchange for that fiat would increase its holding in the company from  to  and at the same time the share held by the government holding agency would be reduced from a controlling  to  the remaining  was taken by the six major spanish banks decreased from their previous  share split equally in  parts owned by every single one of them although not a majority owner fiat now was seen to control the business the deal also included various undertakings by fiat to help in the growth of seat and with the development of a new model possibly the seat  on december   seat also founded its own customer financing company financiera seat sa fiseat to be able to produce independently its own research projects seat on november   came in accordance with fiat so as to start building separate infrastructures aiming at developing new technologies as the brand arranged in  some provisional facilities in the site of the future technical center in martorell and in  began construction works this goal would only take five years till  to be reached with the completion of the first phase in the construction of seats technical center a facility designed by the catalan architect josep antoni coderch during the same period the manufacturer continued to dominate the spanish auto market producing  cars — more than  of the spanish production total — in  despite disruption that year caused by strikes and a serious flood at the coastally sited barcelona plant however with just  cars per thousand people spanish car sales were seen as ripe for further growth and seat faced the prospect of increased competition with other major manufacturers contemplating establishment or expansion of local production facilities in the still heavily protected spanish car market in  seat and citroënhispania jointly contributed equal shares in founding the vigolocated factory of industrias mecánicas de galicia sa indugasa producing constantvelocity joints essential components used in frontwheel drive cars ie in a transmission layout the use of which was becoming more and more common at the time this plant — which in the next years would supply parts not only to seat and citroënhispania but also to ford españa — was meant to be transferred later in  to the multinational company gkn on may  after a request from the spanish state authorities to ensure the rescue of the jobs for the workers in the authi owned factories seat moved on talks with the parent company british leyland motor corporation blmc of the bankrupt authi in order to take over the brands operations in spain leaving aside gms interest in it something which would otherwise open the path for the american automaker to enter the spanish market thus jeopardizing the relationship with fiat the talks ended soon on july  when an agreement was announced between the two parts under which seat would acquire from blmc the authi brand along with its assets for  million pesetas the imposed acquisition of the landaben plant would also result in giving up seats plans to build a new facility in saragossa although the authi supplier factory in manresa was transferred to a company called cometsa for  million pesetas the landaben plant in pamplona remained under seats ownership to continue production on february  only of seat cars this time the s were a decade of rising prosperity in spain which is reflected in the announcement in august  that seat would commence local production of the lancia beta three years later beta production by seat indeed commenced at the companys recently acquired pamplona plant though only the coupe and hpe liftback versions were included the spanish cars were fitted with a simplified suspension system and smaller engines than their italian counterparts in order to qualify for a lower car tax rate in  seats leasing company liseat was founded and in  the gearbox del prat facility was set up as a specialised plant in the production of gearboxes gear mechanisms and differentials in el prat del llobregat near barcelona dispute with fiatedit in the early s extensive discussions concerning funding and control took place between seats major shareholder the spanish government and fiat automobiles seat needed major capital investment which fiat was not prepared to contribute partially due to the oil crisis of the s and in also due to the uncertainty for fiats interests following the end of a protectionist policy against gm in spain the outcome in  was an end to the relationship with fiat after nearly  years a rather surprising decision in spite of the favourable perspectives for the spanish economy with spain being in the anteroom of the european economic community since  seat ronda the end of the cooperation with the italian firm was marked by a change in seats logo in  and the first car under the new seat logo without fiat involvement appeared in the same year the seat ronda styled by rayton fissore in collaboration with the technical centre in martorell the launch of this model though sparked a lawsuit from fiat against seat as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in fiats range the ritmo in defence of seat the then president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas showed a ronda to the press with all the parts different from the fiat ritmo painted in bright yellow to highlight the differences the case was eventually taken to the arbitration chamber of paris which in  declared that differences between both cars were important enough so as not to consider the ronda as a rebadged ritmo ending the dispute in favour of seat rumour at the time had it that fiat was angry because the ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the fiat ritmo which they had to scrap volkswagen group subsidiaryedit seat ibiza mk launched in  it was the first model developed by seat as an independent company together with porsche and karmann in  dr carl horst hahn — who had just assumed responsibility as the chairman of the volkswagenwerk ag volkswagen group — examined the opportunity of approaching seat after fiats withdrawal in his plan to expand the volkswagen groups operations out of germany and turning the german group into a global force it would also follow the precedent set by other global manufacturers such as ford in valencia and general motors in zaragoza in setting up manufacturing operations in spain however the spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms such as toyota nissan and mitsubishi in order to choose a strong partner for seat but it was hahns interest that would soon result in an industrial and commercial cooperation as well as a license agreement with seat on september   for the production in spain of the volkswagen passatsantana and poloderby models in seats zona franca and landaben factories respectively — having thus as an effect on april   the ending of the seat pandas production at the landaben assembly lines due to need of adapting this plant to the production of the vw polo — and eventually a partnership agreement was signed on june   between the two parts being represented by the president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas and carl hahn on behalf of the volkswagenwerk ag seat also gained the rights to distribute volkswagens in spain seat launched its new ibiza a giugiaro styled hatchback which made use of system porsche engines and also featured underpinnings from the fiat ritmostrada in  it also formed the basis of the malaga a fourdoor family saloon seat then began to expand into markets beyond spains borders including the united kingdom where it began selling cars in the autumn of  on june   after a purchase of the  majority stake of seat followed by the increase of its share up to  on december  the volkswagen group became the major shareholder of seat on december   the volkswagen group acquired  ownership of the company thus making seat the first nongerman wholly owned subsidiary of the group fulfilling hahns expectations seat not only made a profit two years after volkswagen bought a majority of its stock but also provided a lowcost manufacturing outlet for other vw group models contributing up to  of the vw groups total output in  — as well as an opportunity to enter the relatively unexploited at that time spanish market under the seat vw and audi names the gathering of the brands main infrastructures in the greater martorell plant area has taken place in a long process beginning back in  with the opening of the seat technical centre but it was only in  when a decision was taken to start building a new main assembly facility next to the technical centre in martorell replacing the old one in zona franca in that same year began the translocation of seats madrid administration offices to barcelona with the sale of two of the brands assets in la castellana to be completed in  with the definitive installation of seats headquarters in the catalonia region seat toledo mk launched in  was the first model fully developed under volkswagen groups ownership the centralisation of the management design research and production facilities localized around the plant site was meant to serve the aim of optimising the development in the process of making new models on february   king juan carlos of spain and the newly elected since january   chairman of the volkswagen group dr ferdinand piëch inaugurated the martorell plant one of the most modern and efficient car plants in europe using the just in time process with its suppliers’ site located only  km away the first cars that rolled out of the martorell plant production lines were the seat ibiza mk and its saloon version the seat córdoba mk the new ibiza was a huge success for seat greatly expanding its market share particularly on export markets the original planning in october  to close the emblematic zona franca assembly plant as soon as the production of vehicles would be transferred to the more efficient martorell plant was overturned after an arrangement between the spanish authorities and the volkswagen group according to which the zona franca site would continue its operations but would be gradually turned into a site with an auxiliary role in the production process foundry pressshop etc meanwhile on december   the fábrica navarra de automóviles sa was founded as a new company to hold the management of the landaben factory separating any ties to seat in production matters with its shares being transferred to volkswagen on june  over which however seat would regain ownership four years later in  in  the design center in sitges — the spanish coastal town south of barcelona — and the suppliers park in zona franca were also inaugurated and in winter of the same year seats financing and leasing companies — fiseat and liseat — were sold to volkswagen financial services ag during  seat in collaboration with suzuki manufactured a door prototype model of a city car internally named as rosé aiming to replace with it the marbella in its range nevertheless this model never made it through to production seat córdoba sx the coupé version of the córdoba mk saloon the first time a seat model was manufactured out of spain was in  with the production of the seat alhambra mk in the palmela autoeuropa plant in portugal also on january  it was the first time when a nonspanish descendant the belgian pierrealain de smedt was ever appointed seats chairman the seat arosa a threedoor city hatchback was launched in  effectively replacing the marbella seats version of the fiat panda which had been in production since the early s on april   the zona franca plant marked the end in the production life cycle of the marbella model signalising an historical moment for seat with the end of vehicle production in seats oldest factory opened in  ever since the zona franca plant produces components and parts to be assembled in other locations it also signaled the demise of seats last fiatbased model in march  at the geneva motor show seat presented a modern stylised logo more rounded compared to the last one and with the use of the silver colour on a red background — instead of the previous blue — symbolising respectively the rational and the emotional this came shortly after the launch of the second generation toledo and shortly before the launch of the toledobased leon hatchback the auto emoción slogan was presented next year in september  reflecting the brands new youthful and sporty corporate

sc sports coupé hatchback sc sports coupé hatchback dr hatchback st sports tourer estatewagon nomenclatureedit seats corporate tradition as a volkswagen group subsidiary dictates that the nomenclature of its model range be inspired by spanish culture thus a large number of seats production models have been named after places in spain eg arosa ibiza córdoba león toledo altea alhambra málaga marbella ronda etc however there have been several exceptions for example the name for the seat exeo — added to the brands range in  — was influenced from the latin word ‘exire’ which means to go beyond following the marques naming trend with production models many of seats concept cars adopted names inspired by either hispanic dances eg tango bolero salsa abbreviations related to existing production models eg ibz for ibiza ibe for ibiza eléctrico tl for toledo etc or even names reminiscent of seats historic sporting roots eg fórmula cupra gt moreover in recent years special versions of the production models specific ranges have been added such as the sc or sportcoupé edition  or st for sporttourer differentiating the door and the estate versions from the standard door ones while the cupra or cup racing edition  and fr for fórmula racing has been used for the highperformance models in the range signalising seats positioning as a sportoriented brand involved in racing historic references can be found with the iconic bocanegra name meaning black mouth in spanish which accompanies the ibiza model and has its origins in the seat  sport the original seat bocanegra due to its black painted fascia in the front subrangesedit ecomotive range almost every model in seats range has an ecomotive derivative version which in comparison to the standard version has a more ecofriendly tuning reduction of weight lowresistance tyres new aerodynamics tweaks in the suspension as well as changes made to the engines electronic management software with an additional implementation of a maintenancefree diesel particle filter dpf for the diesel engines also updates in the gearbox and the gear ratios with a gearshift indicator in the dash panel reminding when it is the proper time to change gears combined with an engine startstop system and an energy recuperation system are some of the modifications adopted in the ecomotive range in order to cut down both fuel consumption and emissions the result is a range with some of the cleanest models featuring an improvement not only in gas and particles emissions but also in fuel economy without big compromise in the vehicles dynamic performance or practicality for example the seat ibiza ecomotive  tdi has co emissions coming up at  gkm and still it comes even faster from  to  kmh than the standard version featuring a door body and airconditioning while the seat león ecomotives co emissions are among the lowest in its segment too and raise up to  gkm up to the present the ecomotive range has been renowned in many occasions in  the ibiza ecomotive has been declared on top of the verkehrsclub deutschland’s  list in the “environmentally beneficial vehicle” category and in the th eco tour not only it has won in the small diesel class but also proved to be the overall winner of all categories in that specific year the seat ibiza ecomotive was also awarded with the ecobest  award  by the autobest organisation and the german newspaper bild am sonntag named it the most economic car of its class in the world the year  has been the one when once more the ibiza ecomotive was nominated for the green steering wheel award in switzerland and has set two consecutive times a new world record on fuel saving with a single tank certified by the ipmc international police motor corporation  the first when the austrian gerhard plattner drove from martorell spain to göttingen germany with an average fuel consumption of  l km and the second time in his route from cieszyn poland to frankfurt germany having achieved the world record in fuel consumption of  l km or  mpg us covering a distance of  km on a single tank multifuel range the multifuel range consists in the introduction of the flexiblefuel

presence in different marketsedit seat  the first model exported by seat in  to colombia became the bestselling car in finland from  to  in its  years there was only a short period from  to  when the firm produced its cars exclusively for the domestic spanish market in  and in a rather symbolic move the company exported some  units of its seat  model destined for colombia by air freight for the first time until two years later in  seat reached a deal over the renegotiation of its licence contract with fiat which allowed the spanish firm to form an international distribution network for its cars and thereafter start its export operations massively to more than twelve different countries entering the export market in  until the early s however most seat exports were sold with fiat badging as a response to seats bid for independence fiat committed themselves to selling  seatbuilt cars a year from  compared to  the year before at the end of  just after seat had won its legal battle with fiat a quarter of the production went to egypt and latin america in europe they were represented in west germany belgium france italy austria and greece the uk ireland and various scandinavian markets were planned to be added in  this was in spite of the company only being able to export the ronda with the fura to follow to date the company has launched its own models in more than  countries worldwide in accordance with the development policies of the volkswagen group with almost threequarters of its annual production representing exports for the markets out of spain its core market remains europe while the most successful market outside of europe in terms of sales for seat is currently mexico where the company has dealer presence in  mexican states in europe the brand has been launched in almost  countries across northern western southern eastern europe and russia seat today also sells its cars in  countries in asia mostly in the middle east and the arabian peninsula in  countries in americas including north america the caribbean sea central america and south america and finally africa mainly in north africa some of its cars have been sold outside europe branded as volkswagens such as the seat ibiza hatchback known in south africa as the volkswagen polo playa the seat inca panel van as the volkswagen caddy or the seat córdoba also known as the volkswagen polo classic in the years to come seat plans expanding in even more markets the most crucial of them all being china while in the past seat held talks with the chinese car maker faw in order to form an alliance for the local production of seat models in chinalocated plants the present project to enter the chinese market comprises in  first to start selling its range with cars produced in seats spainlocated martorell plant followed later in a second phase by the local assembly of seat models in china seats further expansion plans in more markets outside of europe have yet to be realised in the past the company was considering a possible launch in the united states although this move has never been carried out rumours also of a seat model being sold as a volkswagen in canada and the united states to supplement the volkswagens brand lineup there have occasionally circulated but have always been unsubstantiated and ultimately proven to be false in the past other market areas where the brand was also present for a short time were australia and new zealand from  to  as well as south africa from june  to the end of  however the brand was withdrawn from those markets due to volkswagens decision citing that current and expected circumstances made the ongoing importation of a niche brand nonviable seat has been present in the russian federation since  in india all volkswagen group brands are assembled or imported except seat historyedit establishment of seatedit spain is the worlds eighth largest producer of automobiles and its car market stands among the largest in europe however this has not always been the case in the first half of the th century spains economy was relatively underdeveloped compared to other western european countries and had a limited automobile market in this period there was only limited car production and only a few low volume local manufacturers catering mainly to the luxury end of the market of which hispanosuiza was the most successful spains limited market for massproduced vehicles was taken over by foreign companies operating through subsidiaries that either imported cars or assembled cars from imported parts depriving the country of the technological knowhow and large investments needed for mass production the situation greatly deteriorated with the spanish civil war of  to  car demand collapsed not only due to the greatly reduced purchasing power of spaniards caused by war devastation but also because the multinational subsidiaries either ceased operations or were severely stricken by the war and its aftermath seats first emblem the lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weakened post civil war spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests seat dates its origins back to june   when the spanish bank banco urquijo with the support of a group of industrial companies hispanosuiza basconia durofelguera se de construcción naval euskalduna se de construcciones metálicas fundiciones bolueta echevarría etc founded the sociedad ibérica de automóviles de turismo siat with the goal of establishing spains own mass production car maker the initial banco urquijos project aimed at running the siat motor company as a fully private enterprise but soon after  the interventionist state holding company instituto nacional de industria ini following a decision taken by the franco government on january   the goal for the new national car brand was not to be only another licensee car maker assembling foreign designs and parts in spain but of developing the whole manufacturing process from design to assembly within spain because of the countrys lack of expertise in automotive massproduction development it was decided to find a foreign partner who would contribute technically and with its own models in the early years in exchange for cash shares bonds and royalties with the rest of europe having entered the world war ii and spain itself in ruins from its civil war the project was delayed but not abandoned due to its strategic importance josé ortizechagüe puertas seats first ever president was in  made honorary president for life seat under its current name was founded on may   under the denomination sociedad española de automóviles de turismo sa seat by the instituto nacional de industria ini with a starting capital of  million pesetas — equivalent today of almost  million euros — in the form of  thousand shares of one thousand pesetas each and in a time when the country was in need of remodelling the fundamental structures in its national economy just after the end of the world war ii the birth of seat came almost a year and a half after the spanish government and six spanish banks banco urquijo banco español de crédito banesto banco de bilbao banco de vizcaya banco hispanoamericano and banco central had signed on october   an alliance contract with the italian car manufacturer fiat so as to form a partnership with a foreign ally in order to bring to life spains major car manufacturer the favoured bidders were germanys volkswagen and italys fiat fiats bid won for several reasons including fiats prominence in spain and the fact that the company established the shortlived fiat hispania plant in guadalajara which was destroyed in the spanish civil war fiats collaboration with the french company simca proved fiats ability to manage complex international projects fiats experience in the semiprotected car market in italy was seen as the most easily transferable to the one in spain both of which had at the time customers of low incomes and limited markets for cars as well as similar road conditions in italy fiat dominated the market for vehicles under  horsepower which would initially be the main market segment in spain the relative economic isolation of world war ii damaged italy and made fiat interested in opportunities outside italy meaning that the negotiations with the italian manufacturer could prosper more easily in favour of spanish interests than with those from other countries in  the banco urquijo group had revived the siat project and in the next year the talks ended successfully with

the national interest the banco urquijo group although a minority share holder looked forward to assuming a leading role in the future as soon as the company was privatesed partner car maker fiat was offered a  share in exchange of its technical assistance this way seat not only would be able to reinitiate the countrys economic recovery and as the largest employer in the s and s but would also contribute to the industrialisation of what was still a largely rural eoconomy seats barcelona zona franca site and laboratories even though there were initial thoughts of locating in less developed inland cities like valladolid and burgos it was decided that the companys plant would be constructed in the dutyfree zone area of the port of barcelona barcelona zona franca which would offer better access to the mediterranean shipping and the rest of europe through rail and road connections across the nearby french border barcelona was after all a city with an industrial history that had built up expertise in complex industrial enterprises since the latter part of the th century it was also the host location of many early historical spanish car makers like hispanosuiza and elizalde and subsidiaries of foreign car makers like ford motor ibérica and general motors peninsular being an enterprise of vital interest for the national economy as well as an investment opportunity for fiats expansion plans through the iberian peninsula seat benefitted from state tariff and tax exemptions and technical assistance from its foreign partner fiat the company’s first president was the industrial and aeronautical engineer pilot and photographer josé ortizechagüe puertas who came from the spanish aircraft manufacturer construcciones aeronáuticas sa where he had held the position of ceo and who in  was meant to be named the honorary lifetime president of seat partnership with fiatedit seat  the first model produced by seat in  the construction works for seats zona franca plant began on  and the opening day came three years later on june   while in the meantime since  the spanish marque was starting preparations for setting up almost from scratch an entire supplier industry background the first car in the marques history to be produced was a seat  model that came off the production line on november   with licence plate b in the following few months the plants production output and workforce would significally increase together with the implementation of locally made components in the production process in order to limit imports from one part and from another part to push to the development of the almost nonexistent spanish supplier industry and meet seats assigned key role as the national car maker in restoring the spanish economy of the post world war ii spain by  the use of spanishmade parts had risen to  of the total and next year on may   the factory was officially opened nevertheless the impact to the spanish society could not be seen clear immediately since the first model launched by seat was considered a luxury car therefore it was highly priced and still not affordable to the average spanish consumer consequently seat needed a second more economical model to compete against simpler inexpensive designs that appeared in the local market like the biscúter which seemed to suit better to the unwealthy customers looking for a personal mean of transport in a suffering economic environment until the time seat had the technical maturity and expertise to present its first selfdeveloped model the seat  sport in  in its beginnings the company had to manufacture either rebadged or restyled models borrowed from the range of its italian partner fiat automobiles or even redeveloped them according to the needs of its own range however the first example of a seat exclusive derivative would arrive already on september  with the launch of the seat  a car which was developed inhouse by seat with no equivalent model in fiats range on the basis of the seat  as a stretched version with doors a monument in spain for the seat  a symbol of the spanish miracle in  seat founded the seat training centre in the greater zona franca plant area an institution covering the training of qualified personnel and serving the needs of the automobile industry in specialized technical human resources in that same year was launched the historical seat  which proved to be the crucial car that literally motorized spain being the first car for many spanish families and becoming a symbol of the spanish miracle as the growth of the annual production was hitting one record after another due to the heavy demand the economies of scale achieved would permit cutting costs and prices subsequently renew demand and boost sales together with profits for seat on june   the brand opened its new headquarters in madrid which hosted the firms sole — up to  — general administration offices in barcelona was found only seats plant manager until  a year when seat settled in catalonia another general direction seat  sport launched in  it was the first coupé model from seat in  fourteen years after producing cars for the domestic market seats success was signaled by its dominant position in spain ahead of its major competitors ie fasarenault citroënhispania authi and barreiros making seat the spains largest automaker in sales numbers and a wholly localized production in that year an agreement between fiat and the spanish ministry of industry was reached so as to put an end in the restrictions over exporting seat cars out of spain a term of the original licensee contract agreed with fiat in  in exchange for that fiat would increase its holding in the company from  to  and at the same time the share held by the government holding agency would be reduced from a controlling  to  the remaining  was taken by the six major spanish banks decreased from their previous  share split equally in  parts owned by every single one of them although not a majority owner fiat now was seen to control the business the deal also included various undertakings by fiat to help in the growth of seat and with the development of a new model possibly the seat  on december   seat also founded its own customer financing company financiera seat sa fiseat to be able to produce independently its own research projects seat on november   came in accordance with fiat so as to start building separate infrastructures aiming at developing new technologies as the brand arranged in  some provisional facilities in the site of the future technical center in martorell and in  began construction works this goal would only take five years till  to be reached with the completion of the first phase in the construction of seats technical center a facility designed by the catalan architect josep antoni coderch during the same period the manufacturer continued to dominate the spanish auto market producing  cars — more than  of the spanish production total — in  despite disruption that year caused by strikes and a serious flood at the coastally sited barcelona plant however with just  cars per thousand people spanish car sales were seen as ripe for further growth and seat faced the prospect of increased competition with other major manufacturers contemplating establishment or expansion of local production facilities in the still heavily protected spanish car market in  seat and citroënhispania jointly contributed equal shares in founding the vigolocated factory of industrias mecánicas de galicia sa indugasa producing constantvelocity joints essential components used in frontwheel drive cars ie in a transmission layout the use of which was becoming more and more common at the time this plant — which in the next years would supply parts not only to seat and citroënhispania but also to ford españa — was meant to be transferred later in  to the multinational company gkn on may  after a request from the spanish state authorities to ensure the rescue of the jobs for the workers in the authi owned factories seat moved on talks with the parent company british leyland motor corporation blmc of the bankrupt authi in order to take over the brands operations in spain leaving aside gms interest in it something which would otherwise open the path for the american automaker to enter the spanish market thus jeopardizing the relationship with fiat the talks ended soon on july  when an agreement was announced between the two parts under which seat would acquire from blmc the authi brand along with its assets for  million pesetas the imposed acquisition of the landaben plant would also result in giving up seats plans to build a new facility in saragossa although the authi supplier factory in manresa was transferred to a company called cometsa for  million pesetas the landaben plant in pamplona remained under seats ownership to continue production on february  only of seat cars this time the s were a decade of rising prosperity in spain which is reflected in the announcement in august  that seat would commence local production of the lancia beta three years later beta production by seat indeed commenced at the companys recently acquired pamplona plant though only the coupe and hpe liftback versions were included the spanish cars were fitted with a simplified suspension system and smaller engines than their italian counterparts in order to qualify for a lower car tax rate in  seats leasing company liseat was founded and in  the gearbox del prat facility was set up as a specialised plant in the production of gearboxes gear mechanisms and differentials in el prat del llobregat near barcelona dispute with fiatedit in the early s extensive discussions concerning funding and control took place between seats major shareholder the spanish government and fiat automobiles seat needed major capital investment which fiat was not prepared to contribute partially due to the oil crisis of the s and in also due to the uncertainty for fiats interests following the end of a protectionist policy against gm in spain the outcome in  was an end to the relationship with fiat after nearly  years a rather surprising decision in spite of the favourable perspectives for the spanish economy with spain being in the anteroom of the european economic community since  seat ronda the end of the cooperation with the italian firm was marked by a change in seats logo in  and the first car under the new seat logo without fiat involvement appeared in the same year the seat ronda styled by rayton fissore in collaboration with the technical centre in martorell the launch of this model though sparked a lawsuit from fiat against seat as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in fiats range the ritmo in defence of seat the then president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas showed a ronda to the press with all the parts different from the fiat ritmo painted in bright yellow to highlight the differences the case was eventually taken to the arbitration chamber of paris which in  declared that differences between both cars were important enough so as not to consider the ronda as a rebadged ritmo ending the dispute in favour of seat rumour at the time had it that fiat was angry because the ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the fiat ritmo which they had to scrap volkswagen group subsidiaryedit seat ibiza mk launched in  it was the first model developed by seat as an independent company together with porsche and karmann in  dr carl horst hahn — who had just assumed responsibility as the chairman of the volkswagenwerk ag volkswagen group — examined the opportunity of approaching seat after fiats withdrawal in his plan to expand the volkswagen groups operations out of germany and turning the german group into a global force it would also follow the precedent set by other global manufacturers such as ford in valencia and general motors in zaragoza in setting up manufacturing operations in spain however the spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms such as toyota nissan and mitsubishi in order to choose a strong partner for seat but it was hahns interest that would soon result in an industrial and commercial cooperation as well as a license agreement with seat on september   for the production in spain of the volkswagen passatsantana and poloderby models in seats zona franca and landaben factories respectively — having thus as an effect on april   the ending of the seat pandas production at the landaben assembly lines due to need of adapting this plant to the production of the vw polo — and eventually a partnership agreement was signed on june   between the two parts being represented by the president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas and carl hahn on behalf of the volkswagenwerk ag seat also gained the rights to distribute volkswagens in spain seat launched its new ibiza a giugiaro styled hatchback which made use of system porsche engines and also featured underpinnings from the fiat ritmostrada in  it also formed the basis of the malaga a fourdoor family saloon seat then began to expand into markets beyond spains borders including the united kingdom where it began selling cars in the autumn of  on june   after a purchase of the  majority stake of seat followed by the increase of its share up to  on december  the volkswagen group became the major shareholder of seat on december   the volkswagen group acquired  ownership of the company thus making seat the first nongerman wholly owned subsidiary of the group fulfilling hahns expectations seat not only made a profit two years after volkswagen bought a majority of its stock but also provided a lowcost manufacturing outlet for other vw group models contributing up to  of the vw groups total output in  — as well as an opportunity to enter the relatively unexploited at that time spanish market under the seat vw and audi names the gathering of the brands main infrastructures in the greater martorell plant area has taken place in a long process beginning back in  with the opening of the seat technical centre but it was only in  when a decision was taken to start building a new main assembly facility next to the technical centre in martorell replacing the old one in zona franca in that same year began the translocation of seats madrid administration offices to barcelona with the sale of two of the brands assets in la castellana to be completed in  with the definitive installation of seats headquarters in the catalonia region seat toledo mk launched in  was the first model fully developed under volkswagen groups ownership the centralisation of the management design research and production facilities localized around the plant site was meant to serve the aim of optimising the development in the process of making new models on february   king juan carlos of spain and the newly elected since january   chairman of the volkswagen group dr ferdinand piëch inaugurated the martorell plant one of the most modern and efficient car plants in europe using the just in time process with its suppliers’ site located only  km away the first cars that rolled out of the martorell plant production lines were the seat ibiza mk and its saloon version the seat córdoba mk the new ibiza was a huge success for seat greatly expanding its market share particularly on export markets the original planning in october  to close the emblematic zona franca assembly plant as soon as the production of vehicles would be transferred to the more efficient martorell plant was overturned after an arrangement between the spanish authorities and the volkswagen group according to which the zona franca site would continue its operations but would be gradually turned into a site with an auxiliary role in the production process foundry pressshop etc meanwhile on december   the fábrica navarra de automóviles sa was founded as a new company to hold the management of the landaben factory separating any ties to seat in production matters with its shares being transferred to volkswagen on june  over which however seat would regain ownership four years later in  in  the design center in sitges — the spanish coastal town south of barcelona — and the suppliers park in zona franca were also inaugurated and in winter of the same year seats financing and leasing companies — fiseat and liseat — were sold to volkswagen financial services ag during  seat in collaboration with suzuki manufactured a door prototype model of a city car internally named as rosé aiming to replace with it the marbella in its range nevertheless this model never made it through to production seat córdoba sx the coupé version of the córdoba mk saloon the first time a seat model was manufactured out of spain was in  with the production of the seat alhambra mk in the palmela autoeuropa plant in portugal also on january  it was the first time when a nonspanish descendant the belgian pierrealain de smedt was ever appointed seats chairman the seat arosa a threedoor city hatchback was launched in  effectively replacing the marbella seats version of the fiat panda which had been in production since the early s on april   the zona franca plant marked the end in the production life cycle of the marbella model signalising an historical moment for seat with the end of vehicle production in seats oldest factory opened in  ever since the zona franca plant produces components and parts to be assembled in other locations it also signaled the demise of seats last fiatbased model in march  at the geneva motor show seat presented a modern stylised logo more rounded compared to the last one and with the use of the silver

sc sports coupé hatchback sc sports coupé hatchback dr hatchback st sports tourer estatewagon nomenclatureedit seats corporate tradition as a volkswagen group subsidiary dictates that the nomenclature of its model range be inspired by spanish culture thus a large number of seats production models have been named after places in spain eg arosa ibiza córdoba león toledo altea alhambra málaga marbella ronda etc however there have been several exceptions for example the name for the seat exeo — added to the brands range in  — was influenced from the latin word ‘exire’ which means to go beyond following the marques naming trend with production models many of seats concept cars adopted names inspired by either hispanic dances eg tango bolero salsa abbreviations related to existing production models eg ibz for ibiza ibe for ibiza eléctrico tl for toledo etc or even names reminiscent of seats historic sporting roots eg fórmula cupra gt moreover in recent years special versions of the production models specific ranges have been added such as the sc or sportcoupé edition  or st for sporttourer differentiating the door and the estate versions from the standard door ones while the cupra or cup racing edition  and fr for fórmula racing has been used for the highperformance models in the range signalising seats positioning as a sportoriented brand involved in racing historic references can be found with the iconic bocanegra name meaning black mouth in spanish which accompanies the ibiza model and has its origins in the seat  sport the original seat bocanegra due to its black painted fascia in the front subrangesedit ecomotive range almost every model in seats range has an ecomotive derivative version which in comparison to the standard version has a more ecofriendly tuning reduction of weight lowresistance tyres new aerodynamics tweaks in the suspension as well as changes made to the engines electronic management software with an additional implementation of a maintenancefree diesel particle filter dpf for the diesel engines also updates in the gearbox and the gear ratios with a gearshift indicator in the dash panel reminding when it is the proper time to change gears combined with an engine startstop system and an energy recuperation system are some of the modifications adopted in the ecomotive range in order to cut down both fuel consumption and emissions the result is a range with some of the cleanest models featuring an improvement not only in gas and particles emissions but also in fuel economy without big compromise in the vehicles dynamic performance or practicality for example the seat ibiza ecomotive  tdi has co emissions coming up at  gkm and still it comes even faster from  to  kmh than the standard version featuring a door body and airconditioning while the seat león ecomotives co emissions are among the lowest in its segment too and raise up to  gkm up to the present the ecomotive range has been renowned in many occasions in  the ibiza ecomotive has been declared on top of the verkehrsclub deutschland’s  list in the “environmentally beneficial vehicle” category and in the th eco tour not only it has won in the small diesel class but also proved to be the overall winner of all categories in that specific year the seat ibiza ecomotive was also awarded with the ecobest  award  by the autobest organisation and the german newspaper bild am sonntag named it the most economic car of its class in the world the year  has been the one when once more the ibiza ecomotive was nominated for the green steering wheel award in switzerland and has set two consecutive times a new world record on fuel saving with a single tank certified by the ipmc international police motor corporation  the first when the austrian gerhard plattner drove from martorell spain to göttingen germany with an average fuel consumption of  l km and the second time in his route from cieszyn poland to frankfurt germany having achieved the world record in fuel consumption of  l km or  mpg us covering a distance of  km on a single tank multifuel range the multifuel range consists in the introduction of the flexiblefuel

presence in different marketsedit seat  the first model exported by seat in  to colombia became the bestselling car in finland from  to  in its  years there was only a short period from  to  when the firm produced its cars exclusively for the domestic spanish market in  and in a rather symbolic move the company exported some  units of its seat  model destined for colombia by air freight for the first time until two years later in  seat reached a deal over the renegotiation of its licence contract with fiat which allowed the spanish firm to form an international distribution network for its cars and thereafter start its export operations massively to more than twelve different countries entering the export market in  until the early s however most seat exports were sold with fiat badging as a response to seats bid for independence fiat committed themselves to selling  seatbuilt cars a year from  compared to  the year before at the end of  just after seat had won its legal battle with fiat a quarter of the production went to egypt and latin america in europe they were represented in west germany belgium france italy austria and greece the uk ireland and various scandinavian markets were planned to be added in  this was in spite of the company only being able to export the ronda with the fura to follow to date the company has launched its own models in more than  countries worldwide in accordance with the development policies of the volkswagen group with almost threequarters of its annual production representing exports for the markets out of spain its core market remains europe while the most successful market outside of europe in terms of sales for seat is currently mexico where the company has dealer presence in  mexican states in europe the brand has been launched in almost  countries across northern western southern eastern europe and russia seat today also sells its cars in  countries in asia mostly in the middle east and the arabian peninsula in  countries in americas including north america the caribbean sea central america and south america and finally africa mainly in north africa some of its cars have been sold outside europe branded as volkswagens such as the seat ibiza hatchback known in south africa as the volkswagen polo playa the seat inca panel van as the volkswagen caddy or the seat córdoba also known as the volkswagen polo classic in the years to come seat plans expanding in even more markets the most crucial of them all being china while in the past seat held talks with the chinese car maker faw in order to form an alliance for the local production of seat models in chinalocated plants the present project to enter the chinese market comprises in  first to start selling its range with cars produced in seats spainlocated martorell plant followed later in a second phase by the local assembly of seat models in china seats further expansion plans in more markets outside of europe have yet to be realised in the past the company was considering a possible launch in the united states although this move has never been carried out rumours also of a seat model being sold as a volkswagen in canada and the united states to supplement the volkswagens brand lineup there have occasionally circulated but have always been unsubstantiated and ultimately proven to be false in the past other market areas where the brand was also present for a short time were australia and new zealand from  to  as well as south africa from june  to the end of  however the brand was withdrawn from those markets due to volkswagens decision citing that current and expected circumstances made the ongoing importation of a niche brand nonviable seat has been present in the russian federation since  in india all volkswagen group brands are assembled or imported except seat historyedit establishment of seatedit spain is the worlds eighth largest producer of automobiles and its car market stands among the largest in europe however this has not always been the case in the first half of the th century spains economy was relatively underdeveloped compared to other western european countries and had a limited automobile market in this period there was only limited car production and only a few low volume local manufacturers catering mainly to the luxury end of the market of which hispanosuiza was the most successful spains limited market for massproduced vehicles was taken over by foreign companies operating through subsidiaries that either imported cars or assembled cars from imported parts depriving the country of the technological knowhow and large investments needed for mass production the situation greatly deteriorated with the spanish civil war of  to  car demand collapsed not only due to the greatly reduced purchasing power of spaniards caused by war devastation but also because the multinational subsidiaries either ceased operations or were severely stricken by the war and its aftermath seats first emblem the lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weakened post civil war spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests seat dates its origins back to june   when the spanish bank banco urquijo with the support of a group of industrial companies hispanosuiza basconia durofelguera se de construcción naval euskalduna se de construcciones metálicas fundiciones bolueta echevarría etc founded the sociedad ibérica de automóviles de turismo siat with the goal of establishing spains own mass production car maker the initial banco urquijos project aimed at running the siat motor company as a fully private enterprise but soon after  the interventionist state holding company instituto nacional de industria ini following a decision taken by the franco government on january   the goal for the new national car brand was not to be only another licensee car maker assembling foreign designs and parts in spain but of developing the whole manufacturing process from design to assembly within spain because of the countrys lack of expertise in automotive massproduction development it was decided to find a foreign partner who would contribute technically and with its own models in the early years in exchange for cash shares bonds and royalties with the rest of europe having entered the world war ii and spain itself in ruins from its civil war the project was delayed but not abandoned due to its strategic importance josé ortizechagüe puertas seats first ever president was in  made honorary president for life seat under its current name was founded on may   under the denomination sociedad española de automóviles de turismo sa seat by the instituto nacional de industria ini with a starting capital of  million pesetas — equivalent today of almost  million euros — in the form of  thousand shares of one thousand pesetas each and in a time when the country was in need of remodelling the fundamental structures in its national economy just after the end of the world war ii the birth of seat came almost a year and a half after the spanish government and six spanish banks banco urquijo banco español de crédito banesto banco de bilbao banco de vizcaya banco hispanoamericano and banco central had signed on october   an alliance contract with the italian car manufacturer fiat so as to form a partnership with a foreign ally in order to bring to life spains major car manufacturer the favoured bidders were germanys volkswagen and italys fiat fiats bid won for several reasons including fiats prominence in spain and the fact that the company established the shortlived fiat hispania plant in guadalajara which was destroyed in the spanish civil war fiats collaboration with the french company simca proved fiats ability to manage complex international projects fiats experience in the semiprotected car market in italy was seen as the most easily transferable to the one in spain both of which had at the time customers of low incomes and limited markets for cars as well as similar road conditions in italy fiat dominated the market for vehicles under  horsepower which would initially be the main market segment in spain the relative economic isolation of world war ii damaged italy and made fiat interested in opportunities outside italy meaning that the negotiations with the italian manufacturer could prosper more easily in favour of spanish interests than with those from other countries in  the banco urquijo group had revived the siat project and in the next year the talks ended successfully with the signing of a threepart contract with the understanding that the ini would hold a  controlling interest as well as a ruling act in the new company preserving a focused approach of the enterprise in the national interest the banco urquijo group although a minority share holder looked forward to assuming a leading role in the future as soon as the company was privatesed partner car maker fiat was offered a  share in exchange of its technical assistance this way seat not only would be able to reinitiate the countrys economic recovery and as the largest employer in the s and s but would also contribute to the industrialisation of what was still a largely rural eoconomy seats barcelona zona franca site and laboratories even though there were initial thoughts of locating in less developed inland cities like valladolid and burgos it was decided that the companys plant would be constructed in the dutyfree zone area of the port of barcelona barcelona zona franca which would offer better access to the mediterranean shipping and the rest of europe through rail and road connections across the nearby french border barcelona was after all a city with an industrial history that had built up expertise in complex industrial enterprises since the latter part of the th century it was also the host location of many early historical spanish car makers like hispanosuiza and elizalde and subsidiaries of foreign car makers like ford motor ibérica and general motors peninsular being an enterprise of vital interest for the national economy as well as an investment opportunity for fiats expansion plans through the iberian peninsula seat benefitted from state tariff and tax exemptions and technical assistance from its foreign partner fiat the company’s first president was the industrial and aeronautical engineer pilot and photographer josé ortizechagüe puertas who came from the spanish aircraft manufacturer construcciones aeronáuticas sa where he had held the position of ceo and who in  was meant to be named the honorary lifetime president of seat partnership with fiatedit seat  the first model produced by seat in  the construction works for seats zona franca plant began on  and the opening day came three years later on june   while in the meantime since  the spanish marque was starting preparations for setting up almost from scratch an entire supplier industry background the first car in the marques history to be produced was a seat  model that came off the production line on november   with licence plate b in the following few months the plants production output and workforce would significally increase together with the implementation of locally made components in the production process in order to limit imports from one part and from another part to push to the development of the almost nonexistent spanish supplier industry and meet seats assigned key role as the national car maker in restoring the spanish economy of the post world war ii spain by  the use of spanishmade parts had risen to  of the total and next year on may   the factory was officially opened nevertheless the impact to the spanish society could not be seen clear immediately since the first model launched by seat was considered a luxury car therefore it was highly priced and still not affordable to the average spanish consumer consequently seat needed a second more economical model to compete against simpler inexpensive designs that appeared in the local market like the biscúter which seemed to suit better to the unwealthy customers looking for a personal mean of transport in a suffering economic environment until the time seat had the technical maturity and expertise to present its first selfdeveloped model the seat  sport in  in its beginnings the company had to manufacture either rebadged or restyled models borrowed from the range of its italian partner fiat automobiles or even redeveloped them according to the needs of its own range however the first example of a seat exclusive derivative would arrive already on september  with the launch of the seat  a car which was developed inhouse by seat with no equivalent model in fiats range on the basis of the seat  as a stretched version with doors a monument in spain for the seat  a symbol of the spanish miracle in  seat founded the seat training centre in the greater zona franca plant area an institution covering the training of qualified personnel and serving the needs of the automobile industry in specialized technical human resources in that same year was launched the historical seat  which proved to be the crucial car that literally motorized spain being the first car for many spanish families and becoming a symbol of the spanish miracle as the growth of the annual production was hitting one record after another due to the heavy demand the economies of scale achieved would permit cutting costs and prices subsequently renew demand and boost sales together with profits for seat on june   the brand opened its new headquarters in madrid which hosted the firms sole — up to  — general administration offices in barcelona was found only seats plant manager until  a year when seat settled in catalonia another general direction seat  sport launched in  it was the first coupé model from seat in  fourteen years after producing cars for the domestic market seats success was signaled by its dominant position in spain ahead of its major competitors ie fasarenault citroënhispania authi and barreiros making seat the spains largest automaker in sales numbers and a wholly localized production in that year an agreement between fiat and the spanish ministry of industry was reached so as to put an end in the restrictions over exporting seat cars out of spain a term of the original licensee contract agreed with fiat in  in exchange for that fiat would increase its holding in the company from  to  and at the same time the share held by the government holding agency would be reduced from a controlling  to  the remaining  was taken by the six major spanish banks decreased from their previous  share split equally in  parts owned by every single one of them although not a majority owner fiat now was seen to control the business the deal also included various undertakings by fiat to help in the growth of seat and with the development of a new model possibly the seat  on december   seat also founded its own customer financing company financiera seat sa fiseat to be able to produce independently its own research projects seat on november   came in accordance with fiat so as to start building separate infrastructures aiming at developing new technologies as the brand arranged in  some provisional facilities in the site of the future technical center in martorell and in  began construction works this goal would only take five years till  to be reached with the completion of the first phase in the construction of seats technical center a facility designed by the catalan architect josep antoni coderch during the same period the manufacturer continued to dominate the spanish auto market producing  cars — more than  of the spanish production total — in  despite disruption that year caused by strikes and a serious flood at the coastally sited barcelona plant however with just  cars per thousand people spanish car sales were seen as ripe for further growth and seat faced the prospect of increased competition with other major manufacturers contemplating establishment or expansion of local production facilities in the still heavily protected spanish car market in  seat and citroënhispania jointly contributed equal shares in founding the vigolocated factory of industrias mecánicas de galicia sa indugasa producing constantvelocity joints essential components used in frontwheel drive cars ie in a transmission layout the use of which was becoming more and more common at the time this plant — which in the next years would supply parts not only to seat and citroënhispania but also to ford españa — was meant to be transferred later in  to the multinational company gkn on may  after a request from the spanish state authorities to ensure the rescue of the jobs for the workers in the authi owned factories seat moved on talks with the parent company british leyland motor corporation blmc of the bankrupt authi in order to take over the brands operations in spain leaving aside gms interest in it something which would otherwise open the path for the american automaker to enter the spanish market thus jeopardizing the relationship with fiat the talks ended soon on july  when an agreement was announced between the two parts under which seat would acquire from blmc the authi brand along with its assets for  million pesetas the imposed acquisition of the landaben plant would also result in giving up seats plans to build a new facility in saragossa although the authi supplier factory in manresa was transferred to a company called cometsa for  million pesetas the landaben plant in pamplona remained under seats ownership to continue production on february  only of seat cars this time the s were a decade of rising prosperity in spain which is reflected in the announcement in august  that seat would commence local production of the lancia beta three years later beta production by seat indeed commenced at the companys recently acquired pamplona plant though only the coupe and hpe liftback versions were included the spanish cars were fitted with a simplified suspension system and smaller engines than their italian counterparts in order to qualify for a lower car tax rate in  seats leasing company liseat was founded and in  the gearbox del prat facility was set up as a specialised plant in the production of gearboxes gear mechanisms and differentials in el prat del llobregat near barcelona dispute with fiatedit in the early s extensive discussions concerning funding and control took place between seats major shareholder the spanish government and fiat automobiles seat needed major capital investment which fiat was not prepared to contribute partially due to the oil crisis of the s and in also due to the uncertainty for fiats interests following the end of a protectionist policy against gm in spain the outcome in  was an end to the relationship with fiat after nearly  years a rather surprising decision in spite of the favourable perspectives for the spanish economy with spain being in the anteroom of the european economic community since  seat ronda the end of the cooperation with the italian firm was marked by a change in seats logo in  and the first car under the new seat logo without fiat involvement appeared in the same year the seat ronda styled by rayton fissore in collaboration with the technical centre in martorell the launch of this model though sparked a lawsuit from fiat against seat as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in fiats range the ritmo in defence of seat the then president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas showed a ronda to the press with all the parts different from the fiat ritmo painted in bright yellow to highlight the differences the case was eventually taken to the arbitration chamber of paris which in  declared that differences between both cars were important enough so as not to consider the ronda as a rebadged ritmo ending the dispute in favour of seat rumour at the time had it that fiat was angry because the ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the fiat ritmo which they had to scrap volkswagen group subsidiaryedit seat ibiza mk launched in  it was the first model developed by seat as an independent company together with porsche and karmann in  dr carl horst hahn — who had just assumed responsibility as the chairman of the volkswagenwerk ag volkswagen group — examined the opportunity of approaching seat after fiats withdrawal in his plan to expand the volkswagen groups operations out of germany and turning the german group into a global force it would also follow the precedent set by other global manufacturers such as ford in valencia and general motors in zaragoza in setting up manufacturing operations in spain however the spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms such as toyota nissan and mitsubishi in order to choose a strong partner for seat but it was hahns interest that would soon result in an industrial and commercial cooperation as well as a license agreement with seat on september   for the production in spain of the volkswagen passatsantana and poloderby models in seats zona franca and landaben factories respectively — having thus as an effect on april   the ending of the seat pandas production at the landaben assembly lines due to need of adapting this plant to the production of the vw polo — and eventually a partnership agreement was signed on june   between the two parts being represented by the president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas and carl hahn on behalf of the volkswagenwerk ag seat also gained the rights to distribute volkswagens in spain seat launched its new ibiza a giugiaro styled hatchback which made use of system porsche engines and also featured underpinnings from the fiat ritmostrada in  it also formed the basis of the malaga a fourdoor family saloon seat then began to expand into markets beyond spains borders including the united kingdom where it began selling cars in the autumn of  on june   after a purchase of the  majority stake of seat followed by the increase of its share up to  on december  the volkswagen group became the major shareholder of seat on december   the volkswagen group acquired  ownership of the company thus making seat the first nongerman wholly owned subsidiary of the group fulfilling hahns expectations seat not only made a profit two years after volkswagen bought a majority of its stock but also provided a lowcost manufacturing outlet for other vw group models contributing up to  of the vw groups total output in  — as well as an opportunity to enter the relatively unexploited at that time spanish market under the seat vw and audi names the gathering of the brands main infrastructures in the greater martorell plant area has taken place in a long process beginning back in  with the opening of the seat technical centre but it was only in  when a decision was taken to start building a new main assembly facility next to the technical centre in martorell replacing the old one in zona franca in that same year began the translocation of seats madrid administration offices to barcelona with the sale of two of the brands assets in la castellana to be completed in  with the definitive installation of seats headquarters in the catalonia region seat toledo mk launched in  was the first model fully developed under volkswagen groups ownership the centralisation of the management design research and production facilities localized around the plant site was meant to serve the aim of optimising the development in the process of making new models on february   king juan carlos of spain and the newly elected since january   chairman of the volkswagen group dr ferdinand piëch inaugurated the martorell plant one of the most modern and efficient car plants in europe using the just in time process with its suppliers’ site located only  km away the first cars that rolled out of the martorell plant production lines were the seat ibiza mk and its saloon version the seat córdoba mk the new ibiza was a huge success for seat greatly expanding its market share particularly on export markets the original planning in october  to close the emblematic zona franca assembly plant as soon as the production of vehicles would be transferred to the more efficient martorell plant was overturned after an arrangement between the spanish authorities and the volkswagen group according to which the zona franca site would continue its operations but would be gradually turned into a site with an auxiliary role in the production process foundry pressshop etc meanwhile on december   the fábrica navarra de automóviles sa was founded as a new company to hold the management of the landaben factory separating any ties to seat in production matters with its shares being transferred to volkswagen on june  over which however seat would regain ownership four years later in  in  the design center in sitges — the spanish coastal town south of barcelona — and the suppliers park in zona franca were also inaugurated and in winter of the same year seats financing and leasing companies — fiseat and liseat — were sold to volkswagen financial services ag during  seat in collaboration with suzuki manufactured a door prototype model of a city car internally named as rosé aiming to replace with it the marbella in its range nevertheless this model never made it through to production seat córdoba sx the coupé version of the córdoba mk saloon the first time a seat model was manufactured out of spain was in  with the production of the seat alhambra mk in the palmela autoeuropa plant in portugal also on january  it was the first time when a nonspanish descendant the belgian pierrealain de smedt was ever appointed seats chairman the seat arosa a threedoor city hatchback was launched in  effectively replacing the marbella seats version of the fiat panda which had been in production since the early s on april   the zona franca plant marked the end in the production life cycle of the marbella model signalising an historical moment for seat with the end of vehicle production in seats oldest factory opened in  ever since the zona franca plant produces components and parts to be assembled in other locations it also signaled the demise of seats last fiatbased model in march  at the geneva motor show seat presented a modern stylised logo more rounded compared to the last one and with the use of the silver

of its model range be inspired by spanish culture thus a large number of seats production models have been named after places in spain eg arosa ibiza córdoba león toledo altea alhambra málaga marbella ronda etc however there have been several exceptions for example the name for the seat exeo — added to the brands range in  — was influenced from the latin word ‘exire’ which means to go beyond following the marques naming trend with production models many of seats concept cars adopted names inspired by either hispanic dances eg tango bolero salsa abbreviations related to existing production models eg ibz for ibiza ibe for ibiza eléctrico tl for toledo etc or even names reminiscent of seats historic sporting roots eg fórmula cupra gt moreover in recent years special versions of the production models specific ranges have been added such as the sc or sportcoupé edition  or st for sporttourer differentiating the door and the estate versions from the standard door ones while the cupra or cup racing edition  and fr for fórmula racing has been used for the highperformance models in the range signalising seats positioning as a sportoriented brand involved in racing historic references can be found with the iconic bocanegra name meaning black mouth in spanish which accompanies the ibiza model and has its origins in the seat  sport the original seat bocanegra due to its black painted fascia in the front subrangesedit ecomotive range almost every model in seats range has an ecomotive derivative version which in comparison to the standard version has a more ecofriendly tuning reduction of weight lowresistance tyres new aerodynamics tweaks in the suspension as well as changes made to the engines electronic management software with an additional implementation of a maintenancefree diesel particle filter dpf for the diesel engines also updates in the gearbox and the gear ratios with a gearshift indicator in the dash panel reminding when it is the proper time to change gears combined with an engine startstop system and an energy recuperation system are some of the modifications adopted in the ecomotive range in order to cut down both fuel consumption and emissions the result is a range with some of the cleanest models featuring an improvement not only in gas and particles emissions but also in fuel economy without big compromise in the vehicles dynamic performance or practicality for example the seat ibiza ecomotive  tdi has co emissions coming up at  gkm and still it comes even faster from  to  kmh than the standard version featuring a door body and airconditioning while the seat león ecomotives co emissions are among the lowest in its segment too and raise up to  gkm up to the present the ecomotive range has been renowned in many occasions in  the ibiza ecomotive has been declared on top of the verkehrsclub deutschland’s  list in the “environmentally beneficial vehicle” category and in the th eco tour not only it has won in the small diesel class but also proved to be the overall winner of all categories in that specific year the seat ibiza ecomotive was also awarded with the ecobest  award  by the autobest organisation and the german newspaper bild am sonntag named it the most economic car of its class in the world the year  has been the one when once more the ibiza ecomotive was nominated for the green steering wheel award in switzerland and has set two consecutive times a new world record on fuel saving with a single tank certified by the ipmc international police motor corporation  the first when the austrian gerhard plattner drove from martorell spain to göttingen germany with an average fuel consumption of  l km and the second time in his route from cieszyn poland to frankfurt germany having achieved the world record in fuel consumption of  l km or  mpg us covering a distance of  km on a single tank multifuel range the multifuel range consists in the introduction of the flexiblefuel

presence in different marketsedit seat  the first model exported by seat in  to colombia became the bestselling car in finland from  to  in its  years there was only a short period from  to  when the firm produced its cars exclusively for the domestic spanish market in  and in a rather symbolic move the company exported some  units of its seat  model destined for colombia by air freight for the first time until two years later in  seat reached a deal over the renegotiation of its licence contract with fiat which allowed the spanish firm to form an international distribution network for its cars and thereafter start its export operations massively to more than twelve different countries entering the export market in  until the early s however most seat exports were sold with fiat badging as a response to seats bid for independence fiat committed themselves to selling  seatbuilt cars a year from  compared to  the year before at the end of  just after seat had won its legal battle with fiat a quarter of the production went to egypt and latin america in europe they were represented in west germany belgium france italy austria and greece the uk ireland and various scandinavian markets were planned to be added in  this was in spite of the company only being able to export the ronda with the fura to follow to date the company has launched its own models in more than  countries worldwide in accordance with the development policies of the volkswagen group with almost threequarters of its annual production representing exports for the markets out of spain its core market remains europe while the most successful market outside of europe in terms of sales for seat is currently mexico where the company has dealer presence in  mexican states in europe the brand has been launched in almost  countries across northern western southern eastern europe and russia seat today also sells its cars in  countries in asia mostly in the middle east and the arabian peninsula in  countries in americas including north america the caribbean sea central america and south america and finally africa mainly in north africa some of its cars have been sold outside europe branded as volkswagens such as the seat ibiza hatchback known in south africa as the volkswagen polo playa the seat inca panel van as the volkswagen caddy or the seat córdoba also known as the volkswagen polo classic in the years to come seat plans expanding in even more markets the most crucial of them all being china while in the past seat held talks with the chinese car maker faw in order to form an alliance for the local production of seat models in chinalocated plants the present project to enter the chinese market comprises in  first to start selling its range with cars produced in seats spainlocated martorell plant followed later in a second phase by the local assembly of seat models in china seats further expansion plans in more markets outside of europe have yet to be realised in the past the company was considering a possible launch in the united states although this move has never been carried out rumours also of a seat model being sold as a volkswagen in canada and the united states to supplement the volkswagens brand lineup there have occasionally circulated but have always been unsubstantiated and ultimately proven to be false in the past other market areas where the brand was also present for a short time were australia and new zealand from  to  as well as south africa from june  to the end of  however the brand was withdrawn from those markets due to volkswagens decision citing that current and expected circumstances made the ongoing importation of a niche brand nonviable seat has been present in the russian federation since  in india all volkswagen group brands are assembled or imported except seat historyedit establishment of seatedit spain is the worlds eighth largest producer of automobiles and its car market stands among the largest in europe however this has not always been the case in the first half of the th century spains economy was relatively underdeveloped compared to other western european countries and had a limited automobile market in this period there was only limited car production and only a few low volume local manufacturers catering mainly to the luxury end of the market of which hispanosuiza was the most successful spains limited market for massproduced vehicles was taken over by foreign companies operating through subsidiaries that either imported cars or assembled cars from imported parts depriving the country of the technological knowhow and large investments needed for mass production the situation greatly deteriorated with the spanish civil war of  to  car demand collapsed not only due to the greatly reduced purchasing power of spaniards caused by war devastation but also because the multinational subsidiaries either ceased operations or were severely stricken by the war and its aftermath seats first emblem the lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weakened post civil war spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests seat dates its origins back to june   when the spanish bank banco urquijo with the support of a group of industrial companies hispanosuiza basconia durofelguera se de construcción naval euskalduna se de construcciones metálicas fundiciones bolueta echevarría etc founded the sociedad ibérica de automóviles de turismo siat with the goal of establishing spains own mass production car maker the initial banco urquijos project aimed at running the siat motor company as a fully private enterprise but soon after  the interventionist state holding company instituto nacional de industria ini following a decision taken by the franco government on january   the goal for the new national car brand was not to be only another licensee car maker assembling foreign designs and parts in spain but of developing the whole manufacturing process from design to assembly within spain because of the countrys lack of expertise in automotive massproduction development it was decided to find a foreign partner who would contribute technically and with its own models in the early years in exchange for cash shares bonds and royalties with the rest of europe having entered the world war ii and spain itself in ruins from its civil war the project was delayed but not abandoned due to its strategic importance josé ortizechagüe puertas seats first ever president was in  made honorary president for life seat under its current name was founded on may   under the denomination sociedad española de automóviles de turismo sa seat by the instituto nacional de industria ini with a starting capital of  million pesetas — equivalent today of almost  million euros — in the form of  thousand shares of one thousand pesetas each and in a time when the country was in need of remodelling the fundamental structures in its national economy just after the end of the world war ii the birth of seat came almost a year and a half after the spanish government and six spanish banks banco urquijo banco español de crédito banesto banco de bilbao banco de vizcaya banco hispanoamericano and banco central had signed on october   an alliance contract with the italian car manufacturer fiat so as to form a partnership with a foreign ally in order to bring to life spains major car manufacturer the favoured bidders were germanys volkswagen and italys fiat fiats bid won for several reasons including fiats prominence in spain and the fact that the company established the shortlived fiat hispania plant in guadalajara which was destroyed in the spanish civil war fiats collaboration with the french company simca proved fiats ability to manage complex international projects fiats experience in the semiprotected car market in italy was seen as the most easily transferable to the one in spain both of which had at the time customers of low incomes and limited markets for cars as well as similar road conditions in italy fiat dominated the market for vehicles under  horsepower which would initially be the main market segment in spain the relative economic isolation of world war ii damaged italy and made fiat interested in opportunities outside italy meaning that the negotiations with the italian manufacturer could prosper more easily in favour of spanish interests than with those from other countries in  the banco urquijo group had revived the siat project and in the next year the talks ended successfully with the signing of a threepart contract with the understanding that the ini would hold a  controlling interest as well as a ruling act in the new company preserving a focused approach of the enterprise in the national interest the banco urquijo group although a minority share holder looked forward to assuming a leading role in the future as soon as the company was privatesed partner car maker fiat was offered a  share in exchange of its technical assistance this way seat not only would be able to reinitiate the countrys economic recovery and as the largest employer in the s and s but would also contribute to the industrialisation of what was still a largely rural eoconomy seats barcelona zona franca site and laboratories even though there were initial thoughts of locating in less developed inland cities like valladolid and burgos it was decided that the companys plant would be constructed in the dutyfree zone area of the port of barcelona barcelona zona franca which would offer better access to the mediterranean shipping and the rest of europe through rail and road connections across the nearby french border barcelona was after all a city with an industrial history that had built up expertise in complex industrial enterprises since the latter part of the th century it was also the host location of many early historical spanish car makers like hispanosuiza and elizalde and subsidiaries of foreign car makers like ford motor ibérica and general motors peninsular being an enterprise of vital interest for the national economy as well as an investment opportunity for fiats expansion plans through the iberian peninsula seat benefitted from state tariff and tax exemptions and technical assistance from its foreign partner fiat the company’s first president was the industrial and aeronautical engineer pilot and photographer josé ortizechagüe puertas who came from the spanish aircraft manufacturer construcciones aeronáuticas sa where he had held the position of ceo and who in  was meant to be named the honorary lifetime president of seat partnership with fiatedit seat  the first model produced by seat in  the construction works for seats zona franca plant began on  and the opening day came three years later on june   while in the meantime since  the spanish marque was starting preparations for setting up almost from scratch an entire supplier industry background the first car in the marques history to be produced was a seat  model that came off the production line on november   with licence plate b in the following few months the plants production output and workforce would significally increase together with the implementation of locally made components in the production process in order to limit imports from one part and from another part to push to the development of the almost nonexistent spanish supplier industry and meet seats assigned key role as the national car maker in restoring the spanish economy of the post world war ii spain by  the use of spanishmade parts had risen to  of the total and next year on may   the factory was officially opened nevertheless the impact to the spanish society could not be seen clear immediately since the first model launched by seat was considered a luxury car therefore it was highly priced and still not affordable to the average spanish consumer consequently seat needed a second more economical model to compete against simpler inexpensive designs that appeared in the local market like the biscúter which seemed to suit better to the unwealthy customers looking for a personal mean of transport in a suffering economic environment until the time seat had the technical maturity and expertise to present its first selfdeveloped model the seat  sport in  in its beginnings the company had to manufacture either rebadged or restyled models borrowed from the range of its italian partner fiat automobiles or even redeveloped them according to the needs of its own range however the first example of a seat exclusive derivative would arrive already on september  with the launch of the seat  a car which was developed inhouse by seat with no equivalent model in fiats range on the basis of the seat  as a stretched version with doors a monument in spain for the seat  a symbol of the spanish miracle in  seat founded the seat training centre in the greater zona franca plant area an institution covering the training of qualified personnel and serving the needs of the automobile industry in specialized technical human resources in that same year was launched the historical seat  which proved to be the crucial car that literally motorized spain being the first car for many spanish families and becoming a symbol of the spanish miracle as the growth of the annual production was hitting one record after another due to the heavy demand the economies of scale achieved would permit cutting costs and prices subsequently renew demand and boost sales together with profits for seat on june   the brand opened its new headquarters in madrid which hosted the firms sole — up to  — general administration offices in barcelona was found only seats plant manager until  a year when seat settled in catalonia another general direction seat  sport launched in  it was the first coupé model from seat in  fourteen years after producing cars for the domestic market seats success was signaled by its dominant position in spain ahead of its major competitors ie fasarenault citroënhispania authi and barreiros making seat the spains largest automaker in sales numbers and a wholly localized production in that year an agreement between fiat and the spanish ministry of industry was reached so as to put an end in the restrictions over exporting seat cars out of spain a term of the original licensee contract agreed with fiat in  in exchange for that fiat would increase its holding in the company from  to  and at the same time the share held by the government holding agency would be reduced from a controlling  to  the remaining  was taken by the six major spanish banks decreased from their previous  share split equally in  parts owned by every single one of them although not a majority owner fiat now was seen to control the business the deal also included various undertakings by fiat to help in the growth of seat and with the development of a new model possibly the seat  on december   seat also founded its own customer financing company financiera seat sa fiseat to be able to produce independently its own research projects seat on november   came in accordance with fiat so as to start building separate infrastructures aiming at developing new technologies as the brand arranged in  some provisional facilities in the site of the future technical center in martorell and in  began construction works this goal would only take five years till  to be reached with the completion of the first phase in the construction of seats technical center a facility designed by the catalan architect josep antoni coderch during the same period the manufacturer continued to dominate the spanish auto market producing  cars — more than  of the spanish production total — in  despite disruption that year caused by strikes and a serious flood at the coastally sited barcelona plant however with just  cars per thousand people spanish car sales were seen as ripe for further growth and seat faced the prospect of increased competition with other major manufacturers contemplating establishment or expansion of local production facilities in the still heavily protected spanish car market in  seat and citroënhispania jointly contributed equal shares in founding the vigolocated factory of industrias mecánicas de galicia sa indugasa producing constantvelocity joints essential components used in frontwheel drive cars ie in a transmission layout the use of which was becoming more and more common at the time this plant — which in the next years would supply parts not only to seat and citroënhispania but also to ford españa — was meant to be transferred later in  to the multinational company gkn on may  after a request from the spanish state authorities to ensure the rescue of the jobs for the workers in the authi owned factories seat moved on talks with the parent company british leyland motor corporation blmc of the bankrupt authi in order to take over the brands operations in spain leaving aside gms interest in it something which would otherwise open the path for the american automaker to enter the spanish market thus jeopardizing the relationship with fiat the talks ended soon on july  when an agreement was announced between the two parts under which seat would acquire from blmc the authi brand along with its assets for  million pesetas the imposed acquisition of the landaben plant would also result in giving up seats plans to build a new facility in saragossa although the authi supplier factory in manresa was transferred to a company called cometsa for  million pesetas the landaben plant in pamplona remained under seats ownership to continue production on february  only of seat cars this time the s were a decade of rising prosperity in spain which is reflected in the announcement in august  that seat would commence local production of the lancia beta three years later beta production by seat indeed commenced at the companys recently acquired pamplona plant though only the coupe and hpe liftback versions were included the spanish cars were fitted with a simplified suspension system and smaller engines than their italian counterparts in order to qualify for a lower car tax rate in  seats leasing company liseat was founded and in  the gearbox del prat facility was set up as a specialised plant in the production of gearboxes gear mechanisms and differentials in el prat del llobregat near barcelona dispute with fiatedit in the early s extensive discussions concerning funding and control took place between seats major shareholder the spanish government and fiat automobiles seat needed major capital investment which fiat was not prepared to contribute partially due to the oil crisis of the s and in also due to the uncertainty for fiats interests following the end of a protectionist policy against gm in spain the outcome in  was an end to the relationship with fiat after nearly  years a rather surprising decision in spite of the favourable perspectives for the spanish economy with spain being in the anteroom of the european economic community since  seat ronda the end of the cooperation with the italian firm was marked by a change in seats logo in  and the first car under the new seat logo without fiat involvement appeared in the same year the seat ronda styled by rayton fissore in collaboration with the technical centre in martorell the launch of this model though sparked a lawsuit from fiat against seat as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in fiats range the ritmo in defence of seat the then president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas showed a ronda to the press with all the parts different from the fiat ritmo painted in bright yellow to highlight the differences the case was eventually taken to the arbitration chamber of paris which in  declared that differences between both cars were important enough so as not to consider the ronda as a rebadged ritmo ending the dispute in favour of seat rumour at the time had it that fiat was angry because the ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the fiat ritmo which they had to scrap volkswagen group subsidiaryedit seat ibiza mk launched in  it was the first model developed by seat as an independent company together with porsche and karmann in  dr carl horst hahn — who had just assumed responsibility as the chairman of the volkswagenwerk ag volkswagen group — examined the opportunity of approaching seat after fiats withdrawal in his plan to expand the volkswagen groups operations out of germany and turning the german group into a global force it would also follow the precedent set by other global manufacturers such as ford in valencia and general motors in zaragoza in setting up manufacturing operations in spain however the spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms such as toyota nissan and mitsubishi in order to choose a strong partner for seat but it was hahns interest that would soon result in an industrial and commercial cooperation as well as a license agreement with seat on september   for the production in spain of the volkswagen passatsantana and poloderby models in seats zona franca and landaben factories respectively — having thus as an effect on april   the ending of the seat pandas production at the landaben assembly lines due to need of adapting this plant to the production of the vw polo — and eventually a partnership agreement was signed on june   between the two parts being represented by the president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas and carl hahn on behalf of the volkswagenwerk ag seat also gained the rights to distribute volkswagens in spain seat launched its new ibiza a giugiaro styled hatchback which made use of system porsche engines and also featured underpinnings from the fiat ritmostrada in  it also formed the basis of the malaga a fourdoor family saloon seat then began to expand into markets beyond spains borders including the united kingdom where it began selling cars in the autumn of  on june   after a purchase of the  majority stake of seat followed by the increase of its share up to  on december  the volkswagen group became the major shareholder of seat on december   the volkswagen group acquired  ownership of the company thus making seat the first nongerman wholly owned subsidiary of the group fulfilling hahns expectations seat not only made a profit two years after volkswagen bought a majority of its stock but also provided a lowcost manufacturing outlet for other vw group models contributing up to  of the vw groups total output in  — as well as an opportunity to enter the relatively unexploited at that time spanish market under the seat vw and audi names the gathering of the brands main infrastructures in the greater martorell plant area has taken place in a long process beginning back in  with the opening of the seat technical centre but it was only in  when a decision was taken to start building a new main assembly facility next to the technical centre in martorell replacing the old one in zona franca in that same year began the translocation of seats madrid administration offices to barcelona with the sale of two of the brands assets in la castellana to be completed in  with the definitive installation of seats headquarters in the catalonia region seat toledo mk launched in  was the first model fully developed under volkswagen groups ownership the centralisation of the management design research and production facilities localized around the plant site was meant to serve the aim of optimising the development in the process of making new models on february   king juan carlos of spain and the newly elected since january   chairman of the volkswagen group dr ferdinand piëch inaugurated the martorell plant one of the most modern and efficient car plants in europe using the just in time process with its suppliers’ site located only  km away the first cars that rolled out of the martorell plant production lines were the seat ibiza mk and its saloon version the seat córdoba mk the new ibiza was a huge success for seat greatly expanding its market share particularly on export markets the original planning in october  to close the emblematic zona franca assembly plant as soon as the production of vehicles would be transferred to the more efficient martorell plant was overturned after an arrangement between the spanish authorities and the volkswagen group according to which the zona franca site would continue its operations but would be gradually turned into a site with an auxiliary role in the production process foundry pressshop etc meanwhile on december   the fábrica navarra de automóviles sa was founded as a new company to hold the management of the landaben factory separating any ties to seat in production matters with its shares being transferred to volkswagen on june  over which however seat would regain ownership four years later in  in  the design center in sitges — the spanish coastal town south of barcelona — and the suppliers park in zona franca were also inaugurated and in winter of the same year seats financing and leasing companies — fiseat and liseat — were sold to volkswagen financial services ag during  seat in collaboration with suzuki manufactured a door prototype model of a city car internally named as rosé aiming to replace with it the marbella in its range nevertheless this model never made it through to production seat córdoba sx the coupé version of the córdoba mk saloon the first time a seat model was manufactured out of spain was in  with the production of the seat alhambra mk in the palmela autoeuropa plant in portugal also on january  it was the first time when a nonspanish descendant the belgian pierrealain de smedt was ever appointed seats chairman the seat arosa a threedoor city hatchback was launched in  effectively replacing the marbella seats version of the fiat panda which had been in production since the early s on april   the zona franca plant marked the end in the production life cycle of the marbella model signalising an historical moment for seat with the end of vehicle production in seats oldest factory opened in  ever since the zona franca plant produces components and parts to be assembled in other locations it also signaled the demise of seats last fiatbased model in march  at the geneva motor show seat presented a modern stylised logo more rounded compared to the last one and with the use of the silver

of its model range be inspired by spanish culture thus a large number of seats production models have been named after places in spain eg arosa ibiza córdoba león toledo altea alhambra málaga marbella ronda etc however there have been several exceptions for example the name for the seat exeo — added to the brands range in  — was influenced from the latin word ‘exire’ which means to go beyond following the marques naming trend with production models many of seats concept cars adopted names inspired by either hispanic dances eg tango bolero salsa abbreviations related to existing production models eg ibz for ibiza ibe for ibiza eléctrico tl for toledo etc or even names reminiscent of seats historic sporting roots eg fórmula cupra gt moreover in recent years special versions of the production models specific ranges have been added such as the sc or sportcoupé edition  or st for sporttourer differentiating the door and the estate versions from the standard door ones while the cupra or cup racing edition  and fr for fórmula racing has been used for the highperformance models in the range signalising seats positioning as a sportoriented brand involved in racing historic references can be found with the iconic bocanegra name meaning black mouth in spanish which accompanies the ibiza model and has its origins in the seat  sport the original seat bocanegra due to its black painted fascia in the front subrangesedit ecomotive range almost every model in seats range has an ecomotive derivative version which in comparison to the standard version has a more ecofriendly tuning reduction of weight lowresistance tyres new aerodynamics tweaks in the suspension as well as changes made to the engines electronic management software with an additional implementation of a maintenancefree diesel particle filter dpf for the diesel engines also updates in the gearbox and the gear ratios with a gearshift indicator in the dash panel reminding when it is the proper time to change gears combined with an engine startstop system and an energy recuperation system are some of the modifications adopted in the ecomotive range in order to cut down both fuel consumption and emissions the result is a range with some of the cleanest models featuring an improvement not only in gas and particles emissions but also in fuel economy without big compromise in the vehicles dynamic performance or practicality for example the seat ibiza ecomotive  tdi has co emissions coming up at  gkm and still it comes even faster from  to  kmh than the standard version featuring a door body and airconditioning while the seat león ecomotives co emissions are among the lowest in its segment too and raise up to  gkm up to the present the ecomotive range has been renowned in many occasions in  the ibiza ecomotive has been declared on top of the verkehrsclub deutschland’s  list in the “environmentally beneficial vehicle” category and in the th eco tour not only it has won in the small diesel class but also proved to be the overall winner of all categories in that specific year the seat ibiza ecomotive was also awarded with the ecobest  award  by the autobest organisation and the german newspaper bild am sonntag named it the most economic car of its class in the world the year  has been the one when once more the ibiza ecomotive was nominated for the green steering wheel award in switzerland and has set two consecutive times a new world record on fuel saving with a single tank certified by the ipmc international police motor corporation  the first when the austrian gerhard plattner drove from martorell spain to göttingen germany with an average fuel consumption of  l km and the second time in his route from cieszyn poland to frankfurt germany having achieved the world record in fuel consumption of  l km or  mpg us covering a distance of  km on a single tank multifuel range the multifuel range consists in the introduction of the flexiblefuel

presence in different marketsedit seat  the first model exported by seat in  to colombia became the bestselling car in finland from  to  in its  years there was only a short period from  to  when the firm produced its cars exclusively for the domestic spanish market in  and in a rather symbolic move the company exported some  units of its seat  model destined for colombia by air freight for the first time until two years later in  seat reached a deal over the renegotiation of its licence contract with fiat which allowed the spanish firm to form an international distribution network for its cars and thereafter start its export operations massively to more than twelve different countries entering the export market in  until the early s however most seat exports were sold with fiat badging as a response to seats bid for independence fiat committed themselves to selling  seatbuilt cars a year from  compared to  the year before at the end of  just after seat had won its legal battle with fiat a quarter of the production went to egypt and latin america in europe they were represented in west germany belgium france italy austria and greece the uk ireland and various scandinavian markets were planned to be added in  this was in spite of the company only being able to export the ronda with the fura to follow to date the company has launched its own models in more than  countries worldwide in accordance with the development policies of the volkswagen group with almost threequarters of its annual production representing exports for the markets out of spain its core market remains europe while the most successful market outside of europe in terms of sales for seat is currently mexico where the company has dealer presence in  mexican states in europe the brand has been launched in almost  countries across northern western southern eastern europe and russia seat today also sells its cars in  countries in asia mostly in the middle east and the arabian peninsula in  countries in americas including north america the caribbean sea central america and south america and finally africa mainly in north africa some of its cars have been sold outside europe branded as volkswagens such as the seat ibiza hatchback known in south africa as the volkswagen polo playa the seat inca panel van as the volkswagen caddy or the seat córdoba also known as the volkswagen polo classic in the years to come seat plans expanding in even more markets the most crucial of them all being china while in the past seat held talks with the chinese car maker faw in order to form an alliance for the local production of seat models in chinalocated plants the present project to enter the chinese market comprises in  first to start selling its range with cars produced in seats spainlocated martorell plant followed later in a second phase by the local assembly of seat models in china seats further expansion plans in more markets outside of europe have yet to be realised in the past the company was considering a possible launch in the united states although this move has never been carried out rumours also of a seat model being sold as a volkswagen in canada and the united states to supplement the volkswagens brand lineup there have occasionally circulated but have always been unsubstantiated and ultimately proven to be false in the past other market areas where the brand was also present for a short time were australia and new zealand from  to  as well as south africa from june  to the end of  however the brand was withdrawn from those markets due to volkswagens decision citing that current and expected circumstances made the ongoing importation of a niche brand nonviable seat has been present in the russian federation since  in india all volkswagen group brands are assembled or imported except seat historyedit establishment of seatedit spain is the worlds eighth largest producer of automobiles and its car market stands among the largest in europe however this has not always been the case in the first half of the th century spains economy was relatively underdeveloped compared to other western european countries and had a limited automobile market in this period there was only limited car production and only a few low volume local manufacturers catering mainly to the luxury end of the market of which hispanosuiza was the most successful spains limited market for massproduced vehicles was taken over by foreign companies operating through subsidiaries that either imported cars or assembled cars from imported parts depriving the country of the technological knowhow and large investments needed for mass production the situation greatly deteriorated with the spanish civil war of  to  car demand collapsed not only due to the greatly reduced purchasing power of spaniards caused by war devastation but also because the multinational subsidiaries either ceased operations or were severely stricken by the war and its aftermath seats first emblem the lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weakened post civil war spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests seat dates its origins back to june   when the spanish bank banco urquijo with the support of a group of industrial companies hispanosuiza basconia durofelguera se de construcción naval euskalduna se de construcciones metálicas fundiciones bolueta echevarría etc founded the sociedad ibérica de automóviles de turismo siat with the goal of establishing spains own mass production car maker the initial banco urquijos project aimed at running the siat motor company as a fully private enterprise but soon after  the interventionist state holding company instituto nacional de industria ini following a decision taken by the franco government on january   the goal for the new national car brand was not to be only another licensee car maker assembling foreign designs and parts in spain but of developing the whole manufacturing process from design to assembly within spain because of the countrys lack of expertise in automotive massproduction development it was decided to find a foreign partner who would contribute technically and with its own models in the early years in exchange for cash shares bonds and royalties with the rest of europe having entered the world war ii and spain itself in ruins from its civil war the project was delayed but not abandoned due to its strategic importance josé ortizechagüe puertas seats first ever president was in  made honorary president for life seat under its current name was founded on may   under the denomination sociedad española de automóviles de turismo sa seat by the instituto nacional de industria ini with a starting capital of  million pesetas — equivalent today of almost  million euros — in the form of  thousand shares of one thousand pesetas each and in a time when the country was in need of remodelling the fundamental structures in its national economy just after the end of the world war ii the birth of seat came almost a year and a half after the spanish government and six spanish banks banco urquijo banco español de crédito banesto banco de bilbao banco de vizcaya banco hispanoamericano and banco central had signed on october   an alliance contract with the italian car manufacturer fiat so as to form a partnership with a foreign ally in order to bring to life spains major car manufacturer the favoured bidders were germanys volkswagen and italys fiat fiats bid won for several reasons including fiats prominence in spain and the fact that the company established the shortlived fiat hispania plant in guadalajara which was destroyed in the spanish civil war fiats collaboration with the french company simca proved fiats ability to manage complex international projects fiats experience in the semiprotected car market in italy was seen as the most easily transferable to the one in spain both of which had at the time customers of low incomes and limited markets for cars as well as similar road conditions in italy fiat dominated the market for vehicles under  horsepower which would initially be the main market segment in spain the relative economic isolation of world war ii damaged italy and made fiat interested in opportunities outside italy meaning that the negotiations with the italian manufacturer could prosper more easily in favour of spanish interests than with those from other countries in  the banco urquijo group had revived the siat project and in the next year the talks ended successfully with the signing of a threepart contract with the understanding that the ini would hold a  controlling interest as well as a ruling act in the new company preserving a focused approach of the enterprise in the national interest the banco urquijo group although a minority share holder looked forward to assuming a leading role in the future as soon as the company was privatesed partner car maker fiat was offered a  share in exchange of its technical assistance this way seat not only would be able to reinitiate the countrys economic recovery and as the largest employer in the s and s but would also contribute to the industrialisation of what was still a largely rural eoconomy seats barcelona zona franca site and laboratories even though there were initial thoughts of locating in less developed inland cities like valladolid and burgos it was decided that the companys plant would be constructed in the dutyfree zone area of the port of barcelona barcelona zona franca which would offer better access to the mediterranean shipping and the rest of europe through rail and road connections across the nearby french border barcelona was after all a city with an industrial history that had built up expertise in complex industrial enterprises since the latter part of the th century it was also the host location of many early historical spanish car makers like hispanosuiza and elizalde and subsidiaries of foreign car makers like ford motor ibérica and general motors peninsular being an enterprise of vital interest for the national economy as well as an investment opportunity for fiats expansion plans through the iberian peninsula seat benefitted from state tariff and tax exemptions and technical assistance from its foreign partner fiat the company’s first president was the industrial and aeronautical engineer pilot and photographer josé ortizechagüe puertas who came from the spanish aircraft manufacturer construcciones aeronáuticas sa where he had held the position of ceo and who in  was meant to be named the honorary lifetime president of seat partnership with fiatedit seat  the first model produced by seat in  the construction works for seats zona franca plant began on  and the opening day came three years later on june   while in the meantime since  the spanish marque was starting preparations for setting up almost from scratch an entire supplier industry background the first car in the marques history to be produced was a seat  model that came off the production line on november   with licence plate b in the following few months the plants production output and workforce would significally increase together with the implementation of locally made components in the production process in order to limit imports from one part and from another part to push to the development of the almost nonexistent spanish supplier industry and meet seats assigned key role as the national car maker in restoring the spanish economy of the post world war ii spain by  the use of spanishmade parts had risen to  of the total and next year on may   the factory was officially opened nevertheless the impact to the spanish society could not be seen clear immediately since the first model launched by seat was considered a luxury car therefore it was highly priced and still not affordable to the average spanish consumer consequently seat needed a second more economical model to compete against simpler inexpensive designs that appeared in the local market like the biscúter which seemed to suit better to the unwealthy customers looking for a personal mean of transport in a suffering economic environment until the time seat had the technical maturity and expertise to present its first selfdeveloped model the seat  sport in  in its beginnings the company had to manufacture either rebadged or restyled models borrowed from the range of its italian partner fiat automobiles or even redeveloped them according to the needs of its own range however the first example of a seat exclusive derivative would arrive already on september  with the launch of the seat  a car which was developed inhouse by seat with no equivalent model in fiats range on the basis of the seat  as a stretched version with doors a monument in spain for the seat  a symbol of the spanish miracle in  seat founded the seat training centre in the greater zona franca plant area an institution covering the training of qualified personnel and serving the needs of the automobile industry in specialized technical human resources in that same year was launched the historical seat  which proved to be the crucial car that literally motorized spain being the first car for many spanish families and becoming a symbol of the spanish miracle as the growth of the annual production was hitting one record after another due to the heavy demand the economies of scale achieved would permit cutting costs and prices subsequently renew demand and boost sales together with profits for seat on june   the brand opened its new headquarters in madrid which hosted the firms sole — up to  — general administration offices in barcelona was found only seats plant manager until  a year when seat settled in catalonia another general direction seat  sport launched in  it was the first coupé model from seat in  fourteen years after producing cars for the domestic market seats success was signaled by its dominant position in spain ahead of its major competitors ie fasarenault citroënhispania authi and barreiros making seat the spains largest automaker in sales numbers and a wholly localized production in that year an agreement between fiat and the spanish ministry of industry was reached so as to put an end in the restrictions over exporting seat cars out of spain a term of the original licensee contract agreed with fiat in  in exchange for that fiat would increase its holding in the company from  to  and at the same time the share held by the government holding agency would be reduced from a controlling  to  the remaining  was taken by the six major spanish banks decreased from their previous  share split equally in  parts owned by every single one of them although not a majority owner fiat now was seen to control the business the deal also included various undertakings by fiat to help in the growth of seat and with the development of a new model possibly the seat  on december   seat also founded its own customer financing company financiera seat sa fiseat to be able to produce independently its own research projects seat on november   came in accordance with fiat so as to start building separate infrastructures aiming at developing new technologies as the brand arranged in  some provisional facilities in the site of the future technical center in martorell and in  began construction works this goal would only take five years till  to be reached with the completion of the first phase in the construction of seats technical center a facility designed by the catalan architect josep antoni coderch during the same period the manufacturer continued to dominate the spanish auto market producing  cars — more than  of the spanish production total — in  despite disruption that year caused by strikes and a serious flood at the coastally sited barcelona plant however with just  cars per thousand people spanish car sales were seen as ripe for further growth and seat faced the prospect of increased competition with other major manufacturers contemplating establishment or expansion of local production facilities in the still heavily protected spanish car market in  seat and citroënhispania jointly contributed equal shares in founding the vigolocated factory of industrias mecánicas de galicia sa indugasa producing constantvelocity joints essential components used in frontwheel drive cars ie in a transmission layout the use of which was becoming more and more common at the time this plant — which in the next years would supply parts not only to seat and citroënhispania but also to ford españa — was meant to be transferred later in  to the multinational company gkn on may  after a request from the spanish state authorities to ensure the rescue of the jobs for the workers in the authi owned factories seat moved on talks with the parent company british leyland motor corporation blmc of the bankrupt authi in order to take over the brands operations in spain leaving aside gms interest in it something which would otherwise open the path for the american automaker to enter the spanish market thus jeopardizing the relationship with fiat the talks ended soon on july  when an agreement was announced between the two parts under which seat would acquire from blmc the authi brand along with its assets for  million pesetas the imposed acquisition of the landaben plant would also result in giving up seats plans to build a new facility in saragossa although the authi supplier factory in manresa was transferred to a company called cometsa for  million pesetas the landaben plant in pamplona remained under seats ownership to continue production on february  only of seat cars this time the s were a decade of rising prosperity in spain which is reflected in the announcement in august  that seat would commence local production of the lancia beta three years later beta production by seat indeed commenced at the companys recently acquired pamplona plant though only the coupe and hpe liftback versions were included the spanish cars were fitted with a simplified suspension system and smaller engines than their italian counterparts in order to qualify for a lower car tax rate in  seats leasing company liseat was founded and in  the gearbox del prat facility was set up as a specialised plant in the production of gearboxes gear mechanisms and differentials in el prat del llobregat near barcelona dispute with fiatedit in the early s extensive discussions concerning funding and control took place between seats major shareholder the spanish government and fiat automobiles seat needed major capital investment which fiat was not prepared to contribute partially due to the oil crisis of the s and in also due to the uncertainty for fiats interests following the end of a protectionist policy against gm in spain the outcome in  was an end to the relationship with fiat after nearly  years a rather surprising decision in spite of the favourable perspectives for the spanish economy with spain being in the anteroom of the european economic community since  seat ronda the end of the cooperation with the italian firm was marked by a change in seats logo in  and the first car under the new seat logo without fiat involvement appeared in the same year the seat ronda styled by rayton fissore in collaboration with the technical centre in martorell the launch of this model though sparked a lawsuit from fiat against seat as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in fiats range the ritmo in defence of seat the then president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas showed a ronda to the press with all the parts different from the fiat ritmo painted in bright yellow to highlight the differences the case was eventually taken to the arbitration chamber of paris which in  declared that differences between both cars were important enough so as not to consider the ronda as a rebadged ritmo ending the dispute in favour of seat rumour at the time had it that fiat was angry because the ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the fiat ritmo which they had to scrap volkswagen group subsidiaryedit seat ibiza mk launched in  it was the first model developed by seat as an independent company together with porsche and karmann in  dr carl horst hahn — who had just assumed responsibility as the chairman of the volkswagenwerk ag volkswagen group — examined the opportunity of approaching seat after fiats withdrawal in his plan to expand the volkswagen groups operations out of germany and turning the german group into a global force it would also follow the precedent set by other global manufacturers such as ford in valencia and general motors in zaragoza in setting up manufacturing operations in spain however the spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms such as toyota nissan and mitsubishi in order to choose a strong partner for seat but it was hahns interest that would soon result in an industrial and commercial cooperation as well as a license agreement with seat on september   for the production in spain of the volkswagen passatsantana and poloderby models in seats zona franca and landaben factories respectively — having thus as an effect on april   the ending of the seat pandas production at the landaben assembly lines due to need of adapting this plant to the production of the vw polo — and eventually a partnership agreement was signed on june   between the two parts being represented by the president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas and carl hahn on behalf of the volkswagenwerk ag seat also gained the rights to distribute volkswagens in spain seat launched its new ibiza a giugiaro styled hatchback which made use of system porsche engines and also featured underpinnings from the fiat ritmostrada in  it also formed the basis of the malaga a fourdoor family saloon seat then began to expand into markets beyond spains borders including the united kingdom where it began selling cars in the autumn of  on june   after a purchase of the  majority stake of seat followed by the increase of its share up to  on december  the volkswagen group became the major shareholder of seat on december   the volkswagen group acquired  ownership of the company thus making seat the first nongerman wholly owned subsidiary of the group fulfilling hahns expectations seat not only made a profit two years after volkswagen bought a majority of its stock but also provided a lowcost manufacturing outlet for other vw group models contributing up to  of the vw groups total output in  — as well as an opportunity to enter the relatively unexploited at that time spanish market under the seat vw and audi names the gathering of the brands main infrastructures in the greater martorell plant area has taken place in a long process beginning back in  with the opening of the seat technical centre but it was only in  when a decision was taken to start building a new main assembly facility next to the technical centre in martorell replacing the old one in zona franca in that same year began the translocation of seats madrid administration offices to barcelona with the sale of two of the brands assets in la castellana to be completed in  with the definitive installation of seats headquarters in the catalonia region seat toledo mk launched in  was the first model fully developed under volkswagen groups ownership the centralisation of the management design research and production facilities localized around the plant site was meant to serve the aim of optimising the development in the process of making new models on february   king juan carlos of spain and the newly elected since january   chairman of the volkswagen group dr ferdinand piëch inaugurated the martorell plant one of the most modern and efficient car plants in europe using the just in time process with its suppliers’ site located only  km away the first cars that rolled out of the martorell plant production lines were the seat ibiza mk and its saloon version the seat córdoba mk the new ibiza was a huge success for seat greatly expanding its market share particularly on export markets the original planning in october  to close the emblematic zona franca assembly plant as soon as the production of vehicles would be transferred to the more efficient martorell plant was overturned after an arrangement between the spanish authorities and the volkswagen group according to which the zona franca site would continue its operations but would be gradually turned into a site with an auxiliary role in the production process foundry pressshop etc meanwhile on december   the fábrica navarra de automóviles sa was founded as a new company to hold the management of the landaben factory separating any ties to seat in production matters with its shares being transferred to volkswagen on june  over which however seat would regain ownership four years later in  in  the design center in sitges — the spanish coastal town south of barcelona — and the suppliers park in zona franca were also inaugurated and in winter of the same year seats financing and leasing companies — fiseat and liseat — were sold to volkswagen financial services ag during  seat in collaboration with suzuki manufactured a door prototype model of a city car internally named as rosé aiming to replace with it the marbella in its range nevertheless this model never made it through to production seat córdoba sx the coupé version of the córdoba mk saloon the first time a seat model was manufactured out of spain was in  with the production of the seat alhambra mk in the palmela autoeuropa plant in portugal also on january  it was the first time when a nonspanish descendant the belgian pierrealain de smedt was ever appointed seats chairman the seat arosa a threedoor city hatchback was launched in  effectively replacing the marbella seats version of the fiat panda which had been in production since the early s on april   the zona franca plant marked the end in the production life cycle of the marbella model signalising an historical moment for seat with the end of vehicle production in seats oldest factory opened in  ever since the zona franca plant produces components and parts to be assembled in other locations it also signaled the demise of seats last fiatbased model in march  at the geneva motor show seat presented a modern stylised logo more rounded compared to the last one and with the use of the silver

of its model range be inspired by spanish culture thus a large number of seats production models have been named after places in spain eg arosa ibiza córdoba león toledo altea alhambra málaga marbella ronda etc however there have been several exceptions for example the name for the seat exeo — added to the brands range in  — was influenced from the latin word ‘exire’ which means to go beyond following the marques naming trend with production models many of seats concept cars adopted names inspired by either hispanic dances eg tango bolero salsa abbreviations related to existing production models eg ibz for ibiza ibe for ibiza eléctrico tl for toledo etc or even names reminiscent of seats historic sporting roots eg fórmula cupra gt moreover in recent years special versions of the production models specific ranges have been added such as the sc or sportcoupé edition  or st for sporttourer differentiating the door and the estate versions from the standard door ones while the cupra or cup racing edition  and fr for fórmula racing has been used for the highperformance models in the range signalising seats positioning as a sportoriented brand involved in racing historic references can be found with the iconic bocanegra name meaning black mouth in spanish which accompanies the ibiza model and has its origins in the seat  sport the original seat bocanegra due to its black painted fascia in the front subrangesedit ecomotive range almost every model in seats range has an ecomotive derivative version which in comparison to the standard version has a more ecofriendly tuning reduction of weight lowresistance tyres new aerodynamics tweaks in the suspension as well as changes made to the engines electronic management software with an additional implementation of a maintenancefree diesel particle filter dpf for the diesel engines also updates in the gearbox and the gear ratios with a gearshift indicator in the dash panel reminding when it is the proper time to change gears combined with an engine startstop system and an energy recuperation system are some of the modifications adopted in the ecomotive range in order to cut down both fuel consumption and emissions the result is a range with some of the cleanest models featuring an improvement not only in gas and particles emissions but also in fuel economy without big compromise in the vehicles dynamic performance or practicality for example the seat ibiza ecomotive  tdi has co emissions coming up at  gkm and still it comes even faster from  to  kmh than the standard version featuring a door body and airconditioning while the seat león ecomotives co emissions are among the lowest in its segment too and raise up to  gkm up to the present the ecomotive range has been renowned in many occasions in  the ibiza ecomotive has been declared on top of the verkehrsclub deutschland’s  list in the “environmentally beneficial vehicle” category and in the th eco tour not only it has won in the small diesel class but also proved to be the overall winner of all categories in that specific year the seat ibiza ecomotive was also awarded with the ecobest  award  by the autobest organisation and the german newspaper bild am sonntag named it the most economic car of its class in the world the year  has been the one when once more the ibiza ecomotive was nominated for the green steering wheel award in switzerland and has set two consecutive times a new world record on fuel saving with a single tank certified by the ipmc international police motor corporation  the first when the austrian gerhard plattner drove from martorell spain to göttingen germany with an average fuel consumption of  l km and the second time in his route from cieszyn poland to frankfurt germany having achieved the world record in fuel consumption of  l km or  mpg us covering a distance of  km on a single tank multifuel range the multifuel range consists in the introduction of the flexiblefuel

presence in different marketsedit seat  the first model exported by seat in  to colombia became the bestselling car in finland from  to  in its  years there was only a short period from  to  when the firm produced its cars exclusively for the domestic spanish market in  and in a rather symbolic move the company exported some  units of its seat  model destined for colombia by air freight for the first time until two years later in  seat reached a deal over the renegotiation of its licence contract with fiat which allowed the spanish firm to form an international distribution network for its cars and thereafter start its export operations massively to more than twelve different countries entering the export market in  until the early s however most seat exports were sold with fiat badging as a response to seats bid for independence fiat committed themselves to selling  seatbuilt cars a year from  compared to  the year before at the end of  just after seat had won its legal battle with fiat a quarter of the production went to egypt and latin america in europe they were represented in west germany belgium france italy austria and greece the uk ireland and various scandinavian markets were planned to be added in  this was in spite of the company only being able to export the ronda with the fura to follow to date the company has launched its own models in more than  countries worldwide in accordance with the development policies of the volkswagen group with almost threequarters of its annual production representing exports for the markets out of spain its core market remains europe while the most successful market outside of europe in terms of sales for seat is currently mexico where the company has dealer presence in  mexican states in europe the brand has been launched in almost  countries across northern western southern eastern europe and russia seat today also sells its cars in  countries in asia mostly in the middle east and the arabian peninsula in  countries in americas including north america the caribbean sea central america and south america and finally africa mainly in north africa some of its cars have been sold outside europe branded as volkswagens such as the seat ibiza hatchback known in south africa as the volkswagen polo playa the seat inca panel van as the volkswagen caddy or the seat córdoba also known as the volkswagen polo classic in the years to come seat plans expanding in even more markets the most crucial of them all being china while in the past seat held talks with the chinese car maker faw in order to form an alliance for the local production of seat models in chinalocated plants the present project to enter the chinese market comprises in  first to start selling its range with cars produced in seats spainlocated martorell plant followed later in a second phase by the local assembly of seat models in china seats further expansion plans in more markets outside of europe have yet to be realised in the past the company was considering a possible launch in the united states although this move has never been carried out rumours also of a seat model being sold as a volkswagen in canada and the united states to supplement the volkswagens brand lineup there have occasionally circulated but have always been unsubstantiated and ultimately proven to be false in the past other market areas where the brand was also present for a short time were australia and new zealand from  to  as well as south africa from june  to the end of  however the brand was withdrawn from those markets due to volkswagens decision citing that current and expected circumstances made the ongoing importation of a niche brand nonviable seat has been present in the russian federation since  in india all volkswagen group brands are assembled or imported except seat historyedit establishment of seatedit spain is the worlds eighth largest producer of automobiles and its car market stands among the largest in europe however this has not always been the case in the first half of the th century spains economy was relatively underdeveloped compared to other western european countries and had a limited automobile market in this period there was only limited car production and only a few low volume local manufacturers catering mainly to the luxury end of the market of which hispanosuiza was the most successful spains limited market for massproduced vehicles was taken over by foreign companies operating through subsidiaries that either imported cars or assembled cars from imported parts depriving the country of the technological knowhow and large investments needed for mass production the situation greatly deteriorated with the spanish civil war of  to  car demand collapsed not only due to the greatly reduced purchasing power of spaniards caused by war devastation but also because the multinational subsidiaries either ceased operations or were severely stricken by the war and its aftermath seats first emblem the lack of interest shown by the foreign firms in the weakened post civil war spanish market opened an opportunity for local interests seat dates its origins back to june   when the spanish bank banco urquijo with the support of a group of industrial companies hispanosuiza basconia durofelguera se de construcción naval euskalduna se de construcciones metálicas fundiciones bolueta echevarría etc founded the sociedad ibérica de automóviles de turismo siat with the goal of establishing spains own mass production car maker the initial banco urquijos project aimed at running the siat motor company as a fully private enterprise but soon after  the interventionist state holding company instituto nacional de industria ini following a decision taken by the franco government on january   the goal for the new national car brand was not to be only another licensee car maker assembling foreign designs and parts in spain but of developing the whole manufacturing process from design to assembly within spain because of the countrys lack of expertise in automotive massproduction development it was decided to find a foreign partner who would contribute technically and with its own models in the early years in exchange for cash shares bonds and royalties with the rest of europe having entered the world war ii and spain itself in ruins from its civil war the project was delayed but not abandoned due to its strategic importance josé ortizechagüe puertas seats first ever president was in  made honorary president for life seat under its current name was founded on may   under the denomination sociedad española de automóviles de turismo sa seat by the instituto nacional de industria ini with a starting capital of  million pesetas — equivalent today of almost  million euros — in the form of  thousand shares of one thousand pesetas each and in a time when the country was in need of remodelling the fundamental structures in its national economy just after the end of the world war ii the birth of seat came almost a year and a half after the spanish government and six spanish banks banco urquijo banco español de crédito banesto banco de bilbao banco de vizcaya banco hispanoamericano and banco central had signed on october   an alliance contract with the italian car manufacturer fiat so as to form a partnership with a foreign ally in order to bring to life spains major car manufacturer the favoured bidders were germanys volkswagen and italys fiat fiats bid won for several reasons including fiats prominence in spain and the fact that the company established the shortlived fiat hispania plant in guadalajara which was destroyed in the spanish civil war fiats collaboration with the french company simca proved fiats ability to manage complex international projects fiats experience in the semiprotected car market in italy was seen as the most easily transferable to the one in spain both of which had at the time customers of low incomes and limited markets for cars as well as similar road conditions in italy fiat dominated the market for vehicles under  horsepower which would initially be the main market segment in spain the relative economic isolation of world war ii damaged italy and made fiat interested in opportunities outside italy meaning that the negotiations with the italian manufacturer could prosper more easily in favour of spanish interests than with those from other countries in  the banco urquijo group had revived the siat project and in the next year the talks ended successfully with the signing of a threepart contract with the understanding that the ini would hold a  controlling interest as well as a ruling act in the new company preserving a focused approach of the enterprise in the national interest the banco urquijo group although a minority share holder looked forward to assuming a leading role in the future as soon as the company was privatesed partner car maker fiat was offered a  share in exchange of its technical assistance this way seat not only would be able to reinitiate the countrys economic recovery and as the largest employer in the s and s but would also contribute to the industrialisation of what was still a largely rural eoconomy seats barcelona zona franca site and laboratories even though there were initial thoughts of locating in less developed inland cities like valladolid and burgos it was decided that the companys plant would be constructed in the dutyfree zone area of the port of barcelona barcelona zona franca which would offer better access to the mediterranean shipping and the rest of europe through rail and road connections across the nearby french border barcelona was after all a city with an industrial history that had built up expertise in complex industrial enterprises since the latter part of the th century it was also the host location of many early historical spanish car makers like hispanosuiza and elizalde and subsidiaries of foreign car makers like ford motor ibérica and general motors peninsular being an enterprise of vital interest for the national economy as well as an investment opportunity for fiats expansion plans through the iberian peninsula seat benefitted from state tariff and tax exemptions and technical assistance from its foreign partner fiat the company’s first president was the industrial and aeronautical engineer pilot and photographer josé ortizechagüe puertas who came from the spanish aircraft manufacturer construcciones aeronáuticas sa where he had held the position of ceo and who in  was meant to be named the honorary lifetime president of seat partnership with fiatedit seat  the first model produced by seat in  the construction works for seats zona franca plant began on  and the opening day came three years later on june   while in the meantime since  the spanish marque was starting preparations for setting up almost from scratch an entire supplier industry background the first car in the marques history to be produced was a seat  model that came off the production line on november   with licence plate b in the following few months the plants production output and workforce would significally increase together with the implementation of locally made components in the production process in order to limit imports from one part and from another part to push to the development of the almost nonexistent spanish supplier industry and meet seats assigned key role as the national car maker in restoring the spanish economy of the post world war ii spain by  the use of spanishmade parts had risen to  of the total and next year on may   the factory was officially opened nevertheless the impact to the spanish society could not be seen clear immediately since the first model launched by seat was considered a luxury car therefore it was highly priced and still not affordable to the average spanish consumer consequently seat needed a second more economical model to compete against simpler inexpensive designs that appeared in the local market like the biscúter which seemed to suit better to the unwealthy customers looking for a personal mean of transport in a suffering economic environment until the time seat had the technical maturity and expertise to present its first selfdeveloped model the seat  sport in  in its beginnings the company had to manufacture either rebadged or restyled models borrowed from the range of its italian partner fiat automobiles or even redeveloped them according to the needs of its own range however the first example of a seat exclusive derivative would arrive already on september  with the launch of the seat  a car which was developed inhouse by seat with no equivalent model in fiats range on the basis of the seat  as a stretched version with doors a monument in spain for the seat  a symbol of the spanish miracle in  seat founded the seat training centre in the greater zona franca plant area an institution covering the training of qualified personnel and serving the needs of the automobile industry in specialized technical human resources in that same year was launched the historical seat  which proved to be the crucial car that literally motorized spain being the first car for many spanish families and becoming a symbol of the spanish miracle as the growth of the annual production was hitting one record after another due to the heavy demand the economies of scale achieved would permit cutting costs and prices subsequently renew demand and boost sales together with profits for seat on june   the brand opened its new headquarters in madrid which hosted the firms sole — up to  — general administration offices in barcelona was found only seats plant manager until  a year when seat settled in catalonia another general direction seat  sport launched in  it was the first coupé model from seat in  fourteen years after producing cars for the domestic market seats success was signaled by its dominant position in spain ahead of its major competitors ie fasarenault citroënhispania authi and barreiros making seat the spains largest automaker in sales numbers and a wholly localized production in that year an agreement between fiat and the spanish ministry of industry was reached so as to put an end in the restrictions over exporting seat cars out of spain a term of the original licensee contract agreed with fiat in  in exchange for that fiat would increase its holding in the company from  to  and at the same time the share held by the government holding agency would be reduced from a controlling  to  the remaining  was taken by the six major spanish banks decreased from their previous  share split equally in  parts owned by every single one of them although not a majority owner fiat now was seen to control the business the deal also included various undertakings by fiat to help in the growth of seat and with the development of a new model possibly the seat  on december   seat also founded its own customer financing company financiera seat sa fiseat to be able to produce independently its own research projects seat on november   came in accordance with fiat so as to start building separate infrastructures aiming at developing new technologies as the brand arranged in  some provisional facilities in the site of the future technical center in martorell and in  began construction works this goal would only take five years till  to be reached with the completion of the first phase in the construction of seats technical center a facility designed by the catalan architect josep antoni coderch during the same period the manufacturer continued to dominate the spanish auto market producing  cars — more than  of the spanish production total — in  despite disruption that year caused by strikes and a serious flood at the coastally sited barcelona plant however with just  cars per thousand people spanish car sales were seen as ripe for further growth and seat faced the prospect of increased competition with other major manufacturers contemplating establishment or expansion of local production facilities in the still heavily protected spanish car market in  seat and citroënhispania jointly contributed equal shares in founding the vigolocated factory of industrias mecánicas de galicia sa indugasa producing constantvelocity joints essential components used in frontwheel drive cars ie in a transmission layout the use of which was becoming more and more common at the time this plant — which in the next years would supply parts not only to seat and citroënhispania but also to ford españa — was meant to be transferred later in  to the multinational company gkn on may  after a request from the spanish state authorities to ensure the rescue of the jobs for the workers in the authi owned factories seat moved on talks with the parent company british leyland motor corporation blmc of the bankrupt authi in order to take over the brands operations in spain leaving aside gms interest in it something which would otherwise open the path for the american automaker to enter the spanish market thus jeopardizing the relationship with fiat the talks ended soon on july  when an agreement was announced between the two parts under which seat would acquire from blmc the authi brand along with its assets for  million pesetas the imposed acquisition of the landaben plant would also result in giving up seats plans to build a new facility in saragossa although the authi supplier factory in manresa was transferred to a company called cometsa for  million pesetas the landaben plant in pamplona remained under seats ownership to continue production on february  only of seat cars this time the s were a decade of rising prosperity in spain which is reflected in the announcement in august  that seat would commence local production of the lancia beta three years later beta production by seat indeed commenced at the companys recently acquired pamplona plant though only the coupe and hpe liftback versions were included the spanish cars were fitted with a simplified suspension system and smaller engines than their italian counterparts in order to qualify for a lower car tax rate in  seats leasing company liseat was founded and in  the gearbox del prat facility was set up as a specialised plant in the production of gearboxes gear mechanisms and differentials in el prat del llobregat near barcelona dispute with fiatedit in the early s extensive discussions concerning funding and control took place between seats major shareholder the spanish government and fiat automobiles seat needed major capital investment which fiat was not prepared to contribute partially due to the oil crisis of the s and in also due to the uncertainty for fiats interests following the end of a protectionist policy against gm in spain the outcome in  was an end to the relationship with fiat after nearly  years a rather surprising decision in spite of the favourable perspectives for the spanish economy with spain being in the anteroom of the european economic community since  seat ronda the end of the cooperation with the italian firm was marked by a change in seats logo in  and the first car under the new seat logo without fiat involvement appeared in the same year the seat ronda styled by rayton fissore in collaboration with the technical centre in martorell the launch of this model though sparked a lawsuit from fiat against seat as the former claimed the car was too similar to a car in fiats range the ritmo in defence of seat the then president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas showed a ronda to the press with all the parts different from the fiat ritmo painted in bright yellow to highlight the differences the case was eventually taken to the arbitration chamber of paris which in  declared that differences between both cars were important enough so as not to consider the ronda as a rebadged ritmo ending the dispute in favour of seat rumour at the time had it that fiat was angry because the ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the fiat ritmo which they had to scrap volkswagen group subsidiaryedit seat ibiza mk launched in  it was the first model developed by seat as an independent company together with porsche and karmann in  dr carl horst hahn — who had just assumed responsibility as the chairman of the volkswagenwerk ag volkswagen group — examined the opportunity of approaching seat after fiats withdrawal in his plan to expand the volkswagen groups operations out of germany and turning the german group into a global force it would also follow the precedent set by other global manufacturers such as ford in valencia and general motors in zaragoza in setting up manufacturing operations in spain however the spanish authorities had already started talks with other foreign firms such as toyota nissan and mitsubishi in order to choose a strong partner for seat but it was hahns interest that would soon result in an industrial and commercial cooperation as well as a license agreement with seat on september   for the production in spain of the volkswagen passatsantana and poloderby models in seats zona franca and landaben factories respectively — having thus as an effect on april   the ending of the seat pandas production at the landaben assembly lines due to need of adapting this plant to the production of the vw polo — and eventually a partnership agreement was signed on june   between the two parts being represented by the president of seat juan miguel antoñanzas and carl hahn on behalf of the volkswagenwerk ag seat also gained the rights to distribute volkswagens in spain seat launched its new ibiza a giugiaro styled hatchback which made use of system porsche engines and also featured underpinnings from the fiat ritmostrada in  it also formed the basis of the malaga a fourdoor family saloon seat then began to expand into markets beyond spains borders including the united kingdom where it began selling cars in the autumn of  on june   after a purchase of the  majority stake of seat followed by the increase of its share up to  on december  the volkswagen group became the major shareholder of seat on december   the volkswagen group acquired  ownership of the company thus making seat the first nongerman wholly owned subsidiary of the group fulfilling hahns expectations seat not only made a profit two years after volkswagen bought a majority of its stock but also provided a lowcost manufacturing outlet for other vw group models contributing up to  of the vw groups total output in  — as well as an opportunity to enter the relatively unexploited at that time spanish market under the seat vw and audi names the gathering of the brands main infrastructures in the greater martorell plant area has taken place in a long process beginning back in  with the opening of the seat technical centre but it was only in  when a decision was taken to start building a new main assembly facility next to the technical centre in martorell replacing the old one in zona franca in that same year began the translocation of seats madrid administration offices to barcelona with the sale of two of the brands assets in la castellana to be completed in  with the definitive installation of seats headquarters in the catalonia region seat toledo mk launched in  was the first model fully developed under volkswagen groups ownership the centralisation of the management design research and production facilities localized around the plant site was meant to serve the aim of optimising the development in the process of making new models on february   king juan carlos of spain and the newly elected since january   chairman of the volkswagen group dr ferdinand piëch inaugurated the martorell plant one of the most modern and efficient car plants in europe using the just in time process with its suppliers’ site located only  km away the first cars that rolled out of the martorell plant production lines were the seat ibiza mk and its saloon version the seat córdoba mk the new ibiza was a huge success for seat greatly expanding its market share particularly on export markets the original planning in october  to close the emblematic zona franca assembly plant as soon as the production of vehicles would be transferred to the more efficient martorell plant was overturned after an arrangement between the spanish authorities and the volkswagen group according to which the zona franca site would continue its operations but would be gradually turned into a site with an auxiliary role in the production process foundry pressshop etc meanwhile on december   the fábrica navarra de automóviles sa was founded as a new company to hold the management of the landaben factory separating any ties to seat in production matters with its shares being transferred to volkswagen on june  over which however seat would regain ownership four years later in  in  the design center in sitges — the spanish coastal town south of barcelona — and the suppliers park in zona franca were also inaugurated and in winter of the same year seats financing and leasing companies — fiseat and liseat — were sold to volkswagen financial services ag during  seat in collaboration with suzuki manufactured a door prototype model of a city car internally named as rosé aiming to replace with it the marbella in its range nevertheless this model never made it through to production seat córdoba sx the coupé version of the córdoba mk saloon the first time a seat model was manufactured out of spain was in  with the production of the seat alhambra mk in the palmela autoeuropa plant in portugal also on january  it was the first time when a nonspanish descendant the belgian pierrealain de smedt was ever appointed seats chairman the seat arosa a threedoor city hatchback was launched in  effectively replacing the marbella seats version of the fiat panda which had been in production since the early s on april   the zona franca plant marked the end in the production life cycle of the marbella model signalising an historical moment for seat with the end of vehicle production in seats oldest factory opened in  ever since the zona franca plant produces components and parts to be assembled in other locations it also signaled the demise of seats last fiatbased model in march  at the geneva motor show seat presented a modern stylised logo more rounded compared to the last one and with the use of the silver

of its model range be inspired by spanish culture thus a large number of seats production models have been named after places in spain eg arosa ibiza córdoba león toledo altea alhambra málaga marbella ronda etc however there have been several exceptions for example the name for the seat exeo — added to the brands range in  — was influenced from the latin word ‘exire’ which means to go beyond following the marques naming trend with production models many of seats concept cars adopted names inspired by either hispanic dances eg tango bolero salsa abbreviations related to existing production models eg ibz for ibiza ibe for ibiza eléctrico tl for toledo etc or even names reminiscent of seats historic sporting roots eg fórmula cupra gt moreover in recent years special versions of the production models specific ranges have been added such as the sc or sportcoupé edition  or st for sporttourer differentiating the door and the estate versions from the standard door ones while the cupra or cup racing edition  and fr for fórmula racing has been used for the highperformance models in the range signalising seats positioning as a sportoriented brand involved in racing historic references can be found with the iconic bocanegra name meaning black mouth in spanish which accompanies the ibiza model and has its origins in the seat  sport the original seat bocanegra due to its black painted fascia in the front subrangesedit ecomotive range almost every model in seats range has an ecomotive derivative version which in comparison to the standard version has a more ecofriendly tuning reduction of weight lowresistance tyres new aerodynamics tweaks in the suspension as well as changes made to the engines electronic management software with an additional implementation of a maintenancefree diesel particle filter dpf for the diesel engines also updates in the gearbox and the gear ratios with a gearshift indicator in the dash panel reminding when it is the proper time to change gears combined with an engine startstop system and an energy recuperation system are some of the modifications adopted in the ecomotive range in order to cut down both fuel consumption and emissions the result is a range with some of the cleanest models featuring an improvement not only in gas and particles emissions but also in fuel economy without big compromise in the vehicles dynamic performance or practicality for example the seat ibiza ecomotive  tdi has co emissions coming up at  gkm and still it comes even faster from  to  kmh than the standard version featuring a door body and airconditioning while the seat león ecomotives co emissions are among the lowest in its segment too and raise up to  gkm up to the present the ecomotive range has been renowned in many occasions in  the ibiza ecomotive has been declared on top of the verkehrsclub deutschland’s  list in the “environmentally beneficial vehicle” category and in the th eco tour not only it has won in the small diesel class but also proved to be the overall winner of all categories in that specific year the seat ibiza ecomotive was also awarded with the ecobest  award  by the autobest organisation and the german newspaper bild am sonntag named it the most economic car of its class in the world the year  has been the one when once more the ibiza ecomotive was nominated for the green steering wheel award in switzerland and has set two consecutive times a new world record on fuel saving with a single tank certified by the ipmc international police motor corporation  the first when the austrian gerhard plattner drove from martorell spain to göttingen germany with an average fuel consumption of  l km and the second time in his route from cieszyn poland to frankfurt germany having achieved the world record in fuel consumption of  l km or  mpg us covering a distance of  km on a single tank multifuel range the multifuel range consists in the introduction of the flexiblefuel
