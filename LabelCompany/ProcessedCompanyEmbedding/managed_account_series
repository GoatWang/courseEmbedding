in contrast to mutual funds which are professionally managed on behalf of many mutualfund holders managed accounts are personalized investment portfolios tailored to the specific needs of the account holder with a mutual fund the fund company hires a money manager who looks after investments in the funds portfolio and may alter the funds holdings in accordance with its objectives breaking down managed account a managed account may hold assets cash or title to property for the benefit of the client the manager may buy and sell assets without the client’s prior approval as long as the manager acts according to the client’s objectives because a managed account involves fiduciary duty the manager must act in the best interest of the client or potentially face civil or criminal penaltiessimilarities and differences between managed accounts and mutual fundsmanaged accounts and mutual funds help diversify an investor’s portfolio pools of money are invested over a variety of securities that are actively managed by professional managershowever with a managed account the investor puts in money and the manager purchases and places physical shares of securities in the account the account holder owns the securities and may have the manager sell them as desired in contrast mutual funds are classified by investors’ risk tolerance and the funds’ investment objectives not by individual preferences for example an investor with an aggressive growth profile may purchase volatile stocks whereas a conservative investor may purchase safer investments also investors purchasing shares of a mutual fund own a percentage of the value of the fund not the fund itselfwith a managed account days may pass before the manager has the money fully invested also managers may liquidate securities at specific times only conversely shares of mutual funds may typically be purchased and redeemed as desiredwhen owning a managed account the manager may attempt to offset gains and losses by buying and selling assets when it is the most taxefficient time to do so this may result in little or no tax liability in contrast mutual fund shareholders owe taxes on capital gains when portfolio managers sell underlying stocks for a profit therefore shareholders have no control over when capital gains are realizedexample of a managed accountin july  the use of managed accounts was increasing

the definition of wrap account was created to refer to a product offering a multitude of services wrapped in a single fee when the wrap business was a rather obscure niche product used primarily by sophisticated institutional investors and ultrahigh networth individual investors everyone involved in the wrap industry understood the terminology and the products benefits since then however the wrap industry has broadened to a wider market here we look at these changes as well as the benefits and vehicles of wrapped services for more information read the rap on wrap fees for retirement accounts tutorial stock basics evolution of wrap and brokerage vocabularywhen advances in technology reduced the minimum required investment the wrap account became available to an audience of affluent retail investors this new constituency was unfamiliar with the products benefits so wrap account was replaced with the more descriptive managedmoney account the change in terminology focused more on communicating the products benefits as well as its price structure fees are still fully disclosed the creation of the wrap account caused changes also in the traditional language of the brokerage industry various factions of the investment advisory business still debate the use and appropriateness of the titles broker and advisor but the underlying economics of the debate are undisputed the traditional definition of the term broker refers to an investment professional who helps match buyers and sellers in exchange for a commission the size of a traditional brokers paycheck is based on the volume of transactions brokered so if no trades take place the broker doesnt get paid regardless of whether he or she provided any investment advice to clients this role of the broker changed however as some brokers started to offer wrap accounts requiring them to manage money as well as complete client transactions thus brokers took on the responsibilities of advisors not only completing transactions a service that on its own does not regard the assets currently within the clients account but also providing portfolio management when an investment professional whether a broker or advisor works with managedmoney products he or she is paid a flat fee based on the assets under management this fee is recurring regardless of the number of transactions that take place in the investors account feebased investing as this business model is called compensates investment professionals for the advice they provide not for the number of transactions that they generate for more read fullservice brokerage or diy benefits of managed moneywhen you invest in feebased products you receive the benefit of ongoing consultation with a professional financial advisor in exchange for a predictable fee the advisor is responsible for managing your financial plan which includes examining your overall financial situation determining your risk tolerance helping you set goals recommending an asset allocation that is appropriate for your goals assisting with investment selection and monitoring your portfolio and the progress toward your goals because the advisor is paid based on a percentage of assets under management he or she has a personal stake in the success of your portfolio for example if your advisors fee is  and your portfolio contains  he or she earns  per year if your portfolio grows to  that same  fee is now worth  clearly the advisor has a financial incentive to seek out the best available products instead of only selling those that pay the highest commissions this arrangement lessens the investors concern over churning and ensures that advisors play for the same team as their clients  both client and advisor stand to win if the portfolio grows in value managedmoney investment vehicles there are five primary investment vehicles in the managedmoney environment each offering different features and benefits the particulars of each vary based on the firm providing the services but here are the general categories traditional managed or separateaccount programs unlike mutual funds where many investors pool their assets to access the services of a professional money manager traditional managedaccount programs also known as separate accounts allow investors to contract the services of a professional money manager for an account that is separate and distinct from the accounts of other investors these services include significant tax management and portfolio customization investment decisions are based on the investors individual
