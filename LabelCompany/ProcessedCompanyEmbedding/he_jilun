ratings gmi agr® score  rating gmi esg ratings environmental social and governance esg flags gmi ratings publishes environmental social and governance esg ratings on over  companies worldwide these ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies the esg ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of keymetrics® that result in an overall esg concern level as expressed by red high concern yellow average concern and green low concern flags unlike traditional esg risk models gmis rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations specifically these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best esg practices further unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics we assign contextsensitive relative weightings to our key metrics based on market regional ownership or sector differences individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank ranging from  worst ranked to  best on the basis of these keymetrics® and then converted to the red yellow or green flag designation company reports in addition to a companys overall risk rating esg reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the companys risk levels in each esg component area relative to its industry peers further the esg analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the companys overall risk level more about gmi gmi accounting and governance risk agr score  rating the gmi accounting and governance risk agr score  rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a companys management and reported financials scores range from  to  and correspond to a risk
