and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no

that its data platform data fabric has been selected by lenovo to carry out streamlining of inventory and product data from suppliers repositories vendors warehouse and manufacturing and for other ecommerce functionsdoes it fit lenovo’s requirementscurrently lenovo has a huge inventory comprising more than five million items or unique product ids amassed over a period of many years however until now information on these products remained scattered in separate databases inventory management systems and a host of other enterprise resources which made the identification of available products a cumbersome process to carry out  with the help of talend’s data fabric lenovo will now be able to unify this scattered data as well as validate its quality this will also enable lenovo to catalog the information accurately which will pave the way for more actionable information at handin a nutshell data fabric will allow lenovo to streamline inventory and product data from various sources thereby enabling employees partners as well as customers to identify product availability additionally it will also enable lenovo to advise customers in realtime on product delivery

interestbearing obligations including government and investmentgrade debt securities and money market funds the market for our products is highly competitive quickly evolving and subject to rapid changes in technology which may expand the alternatives available to our customers for their data integration requirements our current primary competitors generally fall into four categories • diversified technology companies that offer data integration solutions including ibm microsoft oracle and sap • pureplay data integration vendors including ab initio informatica and tibco • earlystage niche data integration technologies and • handcoded custom data integration solutions built internally by organizations that we target as potential customers we believe that we are wellpositioned in the marketplace relative to our competitors we are differentiated from traditional vendors by our advanced technology and rapid innovation both of which are driven by our open source platform and emerging niche vendors cannot match the scale of our product breadth or gotomarket capabilities many of our existing competitors have and some of our potential competitors could have substantial competitive advantages such as • greater name recognition and longer operating histories • larger sales and marketing budgets and resources • broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and customers • greater customer support resources • greater resources to make acquisitions • lower labor and development costs • larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios and • substantially greater financial technical and other resources we expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the data integration software market as customer requirements evolve and as new products and technologies are introduced we believe that the principal factors that drive our competitive edge in our market include • product features architecture reliability performance and effectiveness • name and reputation of the vendor or competitive offering • vision for the market and product roadmap as well as pace of innovation • interoperability with numerous big data solutions vendors • integration with leading cloud and onpremise systems • automation capabilities • ability to adapt development sales and marketing to the open source software model • strength of sales and marketing efforts • strategic partnerships with major enterprise software and infrastructure providers • quality of support • demonstrated return on investment through timetovalue and total cost of ownership and • easeofuse and efficiency during deployment company description our mission is to enable every organization to harness the power of
