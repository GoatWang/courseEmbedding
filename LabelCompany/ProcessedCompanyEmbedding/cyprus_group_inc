features are becoming more popular for outdoor living spaces the sight  sound of water has always been profound for humans nothing is more relaxing then coming home from work to sit by your water feature and have the stress of your day melt away new technology makes taking care of water features simpler than in the past new pumps filtration systems skimmers and ecosystems have revolutionized the water feature industry there are many types of water features waterfalls  streams  if you want sound then this is the way to go the higher the waterfall the louder it is pondless waterfalls or dry ponds  are one of the easiest to care for as no filtration system is needed they are also an excellent choice if safety is a major factor you get the sound of water from a stream andor waterfall but no standing water as it disappears into the gravel at the bottom the water recirculates from top to bottom the larger the basin below the less you have to refill it an autofill is an excellent idea for this so that you dont have to constantly refill the basin due to evaporation ponds  with fish koi or other or just water plants if you want to go completely natural  how about an ecosystem pond with koi fish turtles andor water plants pools  more traditional in style and usually rectilinear weirs tishways cascades arcfalls  spill edges  metal stone or plastic are used to direct the water and
