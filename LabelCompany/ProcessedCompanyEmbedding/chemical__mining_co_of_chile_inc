net income stocks of main potash producers jumped on january  as researchers fertecon ltd and argus fmb potash said that uralkali the worlds largest potash producer seeks to raise prices for brazil and china according to bloomberg news uralkali trading the potash producers trading arm wants  per ton for granular potash available in march from the largest brazilian buyers thats an increase of as much as  per ton according to the researcher the company is also seeking  per ton for the first half from china in july  russias uralkali quit the partnership with belarusian potash co bpc which together with a rival north american cartel controlled some  percent of the market as a result fertilizer stocks plummeted on fears that the russiabelarus potash dispute would flood the market with cheap potash potash market fundamentals are improving with low inventories and prices stabilizing global potash inventories have declined almost  yy in  and in every region except india potash prices have stabilized in most major markets following the weakness in the late summerfall and uralkali expects chinese contracts late december or early  to set a floor for the market global potash production is expected to grow in the years  due to world population growth and farmer economics and yield optimization as shown in the chart below source mosaic december  citi conference sqm is expanding its potassiumbased products its installed capacity was approximately  million mt in  and its effective capacity is expected to be approximately  million mt by the end of  according to the company internal development of production technologies has allowed for a better utilization of natural resources and for higher yields through increased efficiencies sqm is the only company that produces the three main products of potassium that exist in market today lithium sqm is the worlds largest producer of lithium accounting for about  of the global lithium market lithium is considered the oil of the future due to its use to power electric vehicles total production of electric cars using lithiumion batteries is expected to reach  million in  and  million in  tesla motors lithiumion

electronics they are one of the most popular types of rechargeable battery for portable electronics the kind that powers our laptops tablets and mobile phones with one of the best energy densities hybrid cars are getting more and more popular lithiumion battery powers the hybrid chevrolet volt car allowing it to run for mile kilometer stretches entirely off of the battery source sqm corporate presentation september  iodine sqm is the worlds largest producer of iodine accounting for about  of the global iodine market the compound annual growth rate of the global demand for iodine products between years  to  was  since approximately  of uses of iodine are related to human health and nutrition this percentage is expected to increase specialty plant nutrition sqm produces four principal types of specialty plant nutrients potassium nitrate sodium nitrate sodium potassium nitrate and specialty blends sqm is the global largest producer of potassium nitrate with  world market share potassium nitrate is one of the most important products in this business line the advantages of sqm products plus customized specialty blends that meet specific needs along with agronomic service provided allow sqm to create plant nutrition solutions that add value to crops through higher yields and better quality production because their products are derived from natural nitrate compounds or natural potassium brines they have certain advantages over synthetically produced fertilizers including the presence of certain beneficial trace elements which makes them more attractive to customers who prefer products of natural origin as a result specialty plant nutrition products are sold at a premium price compared to other commodity fertilizers conclusion one of the reasons for the big drop in sqms stock price along with its peers was the july  move by russias uralkali to quit the partnership with belarusian potash this caused fears that the russiabelarus potash dispute would flood the market with cheap potash but potash market fundamentals are improving with low inventories and prices stabilizing global potash inventories have declined almost  yy in  in every region except india sqm as a low cost producer will profit from the increasing demand as the worlds leading producer of lithium chemical  mining co of chile will benefit from the increasing demand for electric cars and mobile electronics devices which are powered by lithiumion batteries sqm has solid financial position its margins and return on capital parameters have been much better than its industry median its sector median and the sp  median the company is focused on longterm growth sqm has lowcost structure due to operational synergies similar processes and industrial technologies are used across its operations solar ponds evaporation salt harvesting crystallizing and drying among others chemical  mining co of chile has been paying uninterrupted dividends since  the forward annual dividend yield is very high at  and the payout ratio is only  the annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at  and over the past five years was at  i consider that besides dividend yield the consistency and the rate of raising dividend payments are the most crucial factors for dividendseeking investors and sqms performance has been quite impressive in this respect all these factors bring me to the conclusion that sqm stock is a smart longterm investment risk according to chemical  mining co of chile the markets in which the company operates are unpredictable are exposed to significant variations in supply and demand and have volatile prices additionally the supply of certain fertilizers or chemical products including certain products which the company trades vary mainly depending on the production of the top producers and their respective business strategies these factors can lead to significant impacts on sale volumes of its products the financial situation of the company and its share price in addition results of operations financial condition and prospects could be affected by changes in policies of the chilean government other political developments in or affecting chile and regulatory and legal changes or administrative practices of chilean authorities over which the company has no control disclosure i am long sqm agu i wrote this article myself

quimica y minera de chi as a hold with a ratings score of c thestreet ratings team has this to say about their recommendation we rate soc quimica y minera de chi sqm a hold the primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed  some indicating strength some showing weaknesses with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks the companys strengths can be seen in multiple areas such as its increase in net income largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and expanding profit margins however as a counter to these strengths we also find weaknesses including disappointing return on equity and a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself if you

issues and arbitrage court decision pending could have a severe impact on revenuesthe current price is too high to give an investing margin of safetychemical  mining co of chile inc nyse sqm is a company that came up when i ran a screen a few months ago the pe ratio then was lower than the current but i still want to see if there is potential in the company or not in this article i will present my findings about the company and its stock i will start with a segmented analysis of sqms businesses followed by the analysis of its business environment a fundamental analysis and will close with a conclusion where i will state my opinion about investing in sqm introduction and about sqm sqm is a global company that produces specialty plant nutrition iodine and derivatives lithium and derivatives industrial chemicals and potassium the company has global diversified sales with no customer representing more than  of sales figure  shows sqms global sales diversification figure  source sqms investor relations the global diversification means that sqms revenues depend on movements on global markets and global prices for its products to make a better analysis it is necessary to first segment the business to its core products the revenue from the various segments for the first two quarters of this year is as follows figure  revenue segmentation for sqm source sqms investor relations the sales are global but the production is domestic and sqm is mining the natural resources available in chile mostly mining mineral deposits in northern chile sqm is quite diversified so to get a clear valuation i will first analyze the individual segments and then combine the value to get a clear valuation the next few chapters are dedicated to a segmented analysis of the business specialty plant and nutrition from the caliche ore deposits sqm produces nitratebased products for specialty plant nutrients fertilizers by volume sqms sales make  of the global potassium nitrate sales as fertilizers are affected by substitute goods sqm is under the influence of the general fertilizer commodity bear market figure  shows the price movement for fertilizers in the last  years figure  fertilizer prices from  to  source ycharts current trailing plant and nutrition revenues are  million  down in relation to  the fall in revenues is closely correlated to the fall in fertilizer prices a positive thing for the future is that fertilizer demand is steadily growing figure  figure  current and expected fertilizer demand source fao but unfortunately for sqm competition in the global fertilizer market is fierce fao estimates for  to  are that potash demand is going to increase by  a year and supply by  a year phosphate demand is going to increase by  and supply by  and nitrogen demand is going to increase by  and supply by  this data shows that we cannot expect higher fertilizer prices because of the higher proportional increase in supply than in demand it will be difficult for sqm to achieve better results in this segment as a neutral estimation i will decrease the current earnings from the plant and nutrition segment by  a year for the next  years this gives us eps for the plant and nutrition segment of  for   for   for  and  for  extraordinary events could push fertilizer prices higher but those are temporary events the general outlook is not positive iodine and derivatives iodine prices are currently at around kg this is a huge slump in relation to the prices achieved in  of kg the peak in  was due to the earthquake and fukushima disaster that hit japan before that disaster prices were around kg in  sqm unfortunately anticipates a continuation of iodine price declines through  as chile accounts for more than  of world iodine production and chilean producers have announced production reductions i will assume that iodine prices will increase in the future or remain stable as iodine accounted for  of profits in the first half of  resulting in  of eps i will assume that due to the possible production reductions iodine earnings will not go lower in the long term and will possibly grow in the future as a cautious estimate i will keep the iodine eps stable at  for the next four years lithium and derivatives lithium is currently the hot commodity for sqm with tesla motors inc nasdaq tsla building the gigafactory and its expected launch in  and general demand for electric cars also growing the demand for lithium is supposed to grow goldman sachs expects that lithium demand will grow about  a year but prices are expected to remain flat due to increased production the current situation on lithium markets is in oversupply but the oversupply is supposed to decline when the gigafactory and general electric car production increases current sqms eps from lithium and derivatives are at  with possible market toughness for lithium and sqm being a historical producer that produces at low cost and was producing lithium before the batteries  gigafactory craze sqm could highly benefit from this segment the future of electric cars could create a fourfold increase in demand and with a cautious estimate that lithium prices could double in the future revenues for sqm would jump from the current  million to at least  million increasing eps related to the extra  million revenue by  the total eps for the lithium segment would then be  a year with a tougher lithium market this number could also be higher as we approach  but that is still a long way to go thus a lot of uncertainties and risks are involved in the lithium play a warning must be issued here that if lithium prices go up electric car prices would also go up and consequently demand for them would fall bringing lithium prices down because of the possible volatility in demand for lithium i will keep a cautious estimation of  eps for the sqm lithium segment that could be reached in the next  years potassium derivatives the main sqm products are potassium chloride and potassium sulphate potassium prices are also decreasing but eps from the segment are at  figure  shows that after the common spike for commodities in the  period and the rebound in  potassium prices are at multiyear lows figure  potassium chloride prices from  to  source indexmundi the outlook does not seem rosy for potassium as governments try to keep prices low and bhp billiton limited nysebhp has the potential to develop its jansen potash project bringing much more supply to market if prices increase as the chart shows that prices might stabilize and the bhp project is not expected in this decade i will keep the  eps stable for potassium for the next few years industrial chemicals the main product with industrial chemicals is solar salt but it brings only  of revenues and profits thus i will not make any estimations but just keep the  eps from this segment business environment sqm operates in chile and except for global sales is dependable on chilean law the current corporate tax in chile is  for sqm and is going to be gradually increased to  in  this increase will affect sqm with  million in deferred taxes costs that is  per share to be distributed into the next four years with the current trailing eps of  we should deduct  per share for the deferred taxes and take away another  from the earnings due to the future increase in taxes in march three sqm board members resigned over disputes on how to handle charges of bribery to political parties sqm also fired its ceo in march because of his refusal to cooperate with the investigation the company has identified suspicious payments of  million without sufficient supporting tax documentation another business issue and potential bad news is the disagreement with the chilean production development corporation corfo where corfo sued sqm stating that sqm has not fully paid quarterly revenues from  onwards for the lease of an area that covers about  hectares of the salar de atacama where sqm mines lithium currently the process is going through arbitrage and a decision from the judge can be expected next year the possible outcomes are that sqm can lose the lease for its lithium mining and has to pay restitution of damages from  to  given the bribery issues and bad public opinion that sqm has at the moment in chile i do not see such a decision as an unlikely outcome another risk that an investor must not forget when investing in chile is that chile is located in a seismicallyactive region and potential earthquakes and tsunamis might disrupt production and exports the potash corporation of saskatchewan inc nyse pot owns about  of sqm and is trying to sell its stake in sqm the ceo of pot announced the sale in may but the fact that there have been no developments or offers up till now shows that the business risks related to sqm are important and that no big companies are ready to pay the asked price fundamental analysis book value per share is  and the current pe ratio is  the debttoassets ratio is around  and the company has enough current assets to cover all its liabilities revenue per share amounts to  the current dividend yield is at  conclusion and opinion the following table shows the combined conservative estimates for sqms earnings in the next five years table  estimates for sqms eps from  to  source own calculations if we relate the estimates to the current stock price of  the company might be correctly valued at current prices and expected earnings but accounting for the potential risks like losing the lithium mining licence with bribery charges adding fuel to the fire the everpresent seismic risk and the commodities bear market likely to still be far from its bottom i would not invest in sqm at current prices a price that would give me a relatively large margin of safety would be one around the book value thus around  this would give me limited downside because even with everything turning out bad for the company and eps being around  it would give a pe ratio of  where with a dividend yield of around  i could calmly wait for better news if things turn out well for sqm and commodity markets turn around sqm could become again a star stock like it was in  and  when prices were around  but the potential risks and bleak commodity markets outlooks show that the risks outweigh the possible benefits i am
