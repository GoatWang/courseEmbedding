housing company and outstanding technological strengths as the panasonic group panahome corporation is promoting the development of smart houses and smart cities to pursue energy technologies for the entire home and for comfortable family lives casart terra builds the future with families in  we were developing a zero carbon footprint house having built an experimental house through collaboration between industry and academia we began verification testing on energy saving and energy management as a consequence the following year marked the debut of the casart terra home which fully exploits sunlight natural breezes and heat to realize a comfortable lifestyle with virtually zero co emissions the full insulation design is employed for the entire home including ceilings exterior walls and even the foundation the lowemissivity doubleglazing glass which has air between two glass panes reduces heat losses even through large windows allyear comfort and energy efficiency made possible by full insulation design and geothermal heat the eco navi ventilation system exploits geothermal heat by reducing the air conditioning load by taking in fresh air from underneath the floorboards that is cooler than the air outside in summer and warmer in winter while enhancing comfort our ventilation system also automatically selects mechanical or natural ventilation by measuring the temperature differences between the inside and outside of the house with sensors and thus maintains good ventilation while reducing thermal losses without sacrificing comfort energy efficiency was improved by combining such natural energy as geothermal heat and integrated hybrid ventilation systems in addition to a full insulation design full insulation design throughout the entire home satisfies japan�s nextgeneration energy standards ventilation system equipped with eco navi the ceiling is covered by rock wool insulation material the exterior wall�s steel is covered by insulation material  depending on plans and specifications may not meet japan�s nextgeneration energysaving standards in response to the increasing demand for zero energy houses after the great east japan earthquake panahome corporation developed a stateoftheart house called a �smart panahome� by adopting an energy creationstorage linked system for the home that combines a photovoltaic power generation system and a storage battery as well as smarthemstm for smart energy management for the entire home the smart panahome enables stressfree energy conservation and gives greater energy independence during power outages we achieved comfort and ecofriendliness for the entire home not only by adopting energy management through energy creation storage and saving equipment but also by combining energy management with passive technology for increasing the building strength with outstanding heat insulation performance and an energy creationstorage linked system for the home the smart panahome reduces co emissions to a net balance of virtually zero spatial design capitalizing on natural energy for an ecofriendly lifestyle we are scaling up our smart house solutions to apply them to an entire town panahome corporation is promoting the development of panahome smart city shioashiya one of the largest such cities in japan around  detached houses in the city will be equipped with an energy creationstorage linked system for the home a w power generation system that combines photovoltaic power generation and enefarm fuel cells and hems our goal is to achieve net zero energy and virtually zero co emissions throughout it we are also planning to build a sustainable town that ensures the safety and security of future generations  surveyed by panahome corporation as of july   panahome smart cities which are characterized by smart houses town design intended to increase asset values and town management for supporting comfortable lifestyles are being expanded across japan photo panahome smart city shioashiya panasonic�s smarthemstm will be installed in panahome smart city shioashiya this will make smart lifestyles even more intelligent through energyefficient operations of home appliances and other equipment throughout entire home and energy management that automatically reduces power consumption the town will support smart grids which will be introduced in the near future panahome smart city shioashiya image products shown here may not be available depending on the country or region zero carbon footprint houses a zero carbon footprint house is a house with virtually zero co emissions where air tightness and thermal insulation performances are enhanced natural energies are effectively used and various systematic equipment and specifications are combined that allow energy creation storage saving and links to make the energy balance visible energy creationstorage linked system for the home this system enables efficient storage of the electricity generated created by photovoltaic or fuel cell cogeneration systems and the use of this electricity when main power is close to its limit or temporarily unavailable alternating current ac is generally used to transmit electricity but since photovoltaic power generation systems and storage battery units supply direct current dc photovoltaic power generation systems are equipped with a dcac converter this power conditioner is not  efficient so energy is lost during the conversion process acdc conversion is also required for storing power in storage battery units the hardwired systems for energy creation and storage however directly store the dc power from photovoltaic panels in storage battery units to maximize the use of the generated power eco solutions company  panasonics

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
