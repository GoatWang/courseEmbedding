just starting out the other a bestseller join james blatch and mark dawson and their amazing guests as they discuss how you can make a living telling stories there’s never been a better time to be a writer james blatch hello welcome today last time well not last time but at some point when we were recording somebody emailed us to say that we have to get rid of paper cups we should get mugs mark dawson oh okay james blatch so spf mugs obviously can we afford them mark dawson we’ve already got a couple of mugs in essex james blatch there’s one of them sitting down there uh hello  these are british mugs with the union flag on them lounge’s coffee i don’t know where this … oh that’s the cosy club which looks like a private members club it’s obviously starred on that ’s type of feel in salisbury it’s rather nice isn’t it we’ve eaten there a couple of times mark dawson we have yup it’s one of my regulars james blatch yeah and surely you’ve got an actual club as well are you a member of a club mark dawson i am not a member of a club no what was it that winston churchill said about clubs james blatch no it was groucho marx mark dawson groucho marx james blatch he wouldn’t be a member of any club that had him … mark dawson that’s right very true james blatch i think it was groucho someone will look it up and tell us who said that but we are going to move on from the launch which we talked about last week and surely you can find the club membership fee out of the  you cleared in profit last time we are going to talk about should we call it ‘the beast’ the large looming single organization that … mark dawson the  pound gorilla james blatch the  pound gorilla yes cause we talk about lots of retailers and we talk about lots of services but there is one name if you’re an indie publisher frankly if you’re a traditional publisher now as well that’s a very important name in your life and that is amazon so amazon we don’t know huge amounts about it do we just this company that is there when we turn on our computers started by a guy called jeff bezos a few years ago who that thought that people buying stuff on the computer would be the future mark dawson started with books james blatch and he was right mark dawson he was absolutely right yes james blatch it was books wasn’t it yes mark dawson yeah and now of course everything is possible with amazon james blatch as you know from your affiliate sales everything and anything is possible mark dawson yes i had all kinds of things bought on amazon which we won’t go into here as a child friendly podcast but i’ve had some interesting … james blatch things that could keep a relationship alive mark dawson so i’m told james blatch and some expensive wrist watches mark dawson yes that’s true so yes amazon so i’ve known darren who we went to london to interview i’ve known darren for a couple of years now and it’s quite a funny story how i got to know darren i started to sell pretty well in  so that was when i was still employed when we were all working together in the same place watching movies for a living i was doing quite well and darren reached out to me because i think they noticed that i was selling quite strongly and they reached out to me and said “is there any way we can work together to help you sell a few more books” of course that sounded good to me so we started to work together and as the year progressed we got to november and i remember this very vividly i stopped working on the th of november  and went out to do this full time and literally an hour after i had handed in my notice yeah this would be in october i finished in november so i handed in my notice a month before an hour or so after i went into the boss’s office and said “look thanks very much you can stick your job right there “ i didn’t put it quite like that darren called me and said “hi darren it’s mark from … it’s darren from amazon” james blatch was he confused when he called you mark dawson he was as confused as i am right now he said “hi mark it’s darren from amazon i’m afraid we’ve got quite a bit of a problem with your account” so i’m thinking all right my wife’s on maternity i’ve just basically jacked my job in what on earth is the problem and he said “well if you check your bank account i think you’ll find we’ve overpaid you this month” i was expecting him to say “by maybe a few pounds” it was probably something like  pounds it was a huge amount of money anyway it was all fine basically they’re very flexible so it was paid  i didn’t earn any extra royalties for about  or  months james blatch right mark dawson as that was recouped effectively james blatch in advance mark dawson it was effectively an advance yeah but they were really relaxed about it you’ll hear from when we speak to darren that he’s a very laidback guy and a lovely lovely guy so i’ve met him lots of times now since i’ve gone full time i’ve spoken at the london book fair two times i’ll be speaking with amazon again in march this year i’ve been to dublin to do an event with them darren again i’ve spoken at an amazon academy event in london so we see each other a fair amount and the other staff at amazon who are equally lovely it’s fair to say i think that amazon has changed my life it is the company that i started to do well on first of all and i’ve got a very fond space in my heart for them because they did enable me to do what i’ve always wanted to do and that’s tell stories and entertain people and although i get amazing support now from the other platforms especially acal and kobo who i love as well the guys there are fantastic amazon is still about  of my income comes from amazon so i’m a big amazon backer unashamedly so and we can talk about some of the things that people say about amazon perhaps after we listen to the interview because not every one loves amazon in fact far from it some people actively dislike them i’m certainly not one of those people and we can have a chat about their role in the industry the responsibilities that come with being by far the biggest player but i think it would be good to do that after we’ve spoken to darren james blatch so mark and i have been released from captivity haven’t we we’ve come to the city of london mark dawson mmhmm affirmative james blatch and one of amazon’s buildings here in the uk it’s rather nice inside and this is a place you’ve been before i think mark mark dawson i have yes because audible are here and abe publishing are here as well abe pub so yeah i’ve been here a few times james blatch yeah and amazon the beast at the center of the publishing industry in the world now it sounds like a slightly negative tone but let’s bring in darren hardy who we’re here to talk to today so darren the manager of kdp in the uk darren hardy that’s right yes i’ve never been called a beast before mark dawson no james blatch ‘the beast of publishing’ there you go something for your business card well look thank you very much for coming on to the podcast amazon is such a big feature in our writers lives there are a number of platforms but the word ‘beast’ probably does describe the place amazon has right culturally it’s right at the center isn’t it now darren hardy well i think certainly programs like kindle direct publishing’s you say have had a huge impact for authors so i think we hear lots of enthusiastic response about what we’re doing clearly kindle direct publishing is in the heart of what a lot of authors are doing which is great so long may that continue james blatch good well we’ve got a few questions for you mark some from us some from our listeners i’m going to try and bring it back occasionally to newbie language because i don’t necessarily understand i haven’t published my first book yet there’s choices about kindle select and all the rest of it i can’t even get the terminology right but you know what i mean kdp select darren hardy yes there’s exclusivity on the one hand with amazon or go wide with everyone james blatch yeah  i’m getting into lingo like ‘going wide’ i may interrupt every now and again to say “what are you talking about” but where are we going to start because i know we want to get through as much as we can in the time that we’ve got mark dawson yeah i think it would be really interesting to talk to darren about his time at amazon obviously i’ve known darren for a little while now and i mentioned in the introduction the phone call that you made to me the time i handed in my notice about there being a problem with my account which was possibly the first time we’d spoken but that was not the most auspicious start but since then we’ve been to the conferences together and spoken onstage and it’s been great now i know that darren has been at amazon for a very long time so probably one of the earliest uk employees would that be fair to say darren hardy i’ve at amazon for about  years so certainly not the earliest but one of that initial group of people that have been around for a little bit of time but i’ve always worked in book selling in one form of another so fresh out of university i did that classic thing of not quite knowing what it was i wanted to do with my life working in the local bookshop while i sort of made my decisions and just falling in love with books and falling in love with the idea of authors exchanging ideas and just the huge amount of variety within the publishing world so here i am  looking after kdp james blatch  years that must be a long service award at amazon do you have a cup darren hardy no i don’t think so no nothing quite like that it’s one of the things actually that surprised me i think one of the amazing things about publishing not just amazon but especially about amazon is there are so many things happening there are so many new things coming along and changes that it actually often surprises me when i say “yes i’ve been here for this amount of time” because in some ways it feels like only yesterday there’s no sense of … i’ve worked at other businesses for a shorter periods of time and you sort of sometimes feel that you’ve been there a while it sounds a bit of a cliché but i genuinely do skip into work in the morning thinking actually there are some really fun things going to happen and i get to meet mark and people like that all the time which is one of the great things about my role is working so closely with so many authors and people within the publishing industry so yes it’s great fun mark dawson so  years ago you came to amazon for the first time so that would have been prekindle james blatch yes mark dawson prekdp so how long have you actually been involved with the kindle side of things darren hardy so i’ve been working in the kindle direct of publishing side for about three years now three and a half years i used to work on the print book side so i was sort of in the publisher relations team on that side of the business i just wanted to do something slightly different for me personally working within books and within publishing is absolutely what i love doing obviously moving from the printed books world and the managed traditionally published world into kindle was a very different thing and then coming into kindle direct publishing was sort of different all over again so it enabled me to continue within the industry but to do some different things as i say i haven’t looked back it’s been really interesting mark dawson how did you feel about the kindle when it came out i’ve said before that i wasn’t an early adopter by any means i was probably reluctant to read on a device i love books i love the smell of books and the touch and the feel of them now that’s completely changed i read everything on my kindle did you feel the same way as you came across darren hardy yes i mean not as reluctant for me i’ve always been surrounded by books and my parents and my family are absolutely emersed in books but one of the things that i was always very conscious of is some of my relatives some of my family weren’t lucky enough to be near a bookshop or weren’t lucky enough to for my older family to actually be able to go into a bookshop so one of the things i was really conscious of was that the kindle really did open the door to the access to books really did make it so much easier to get books i grew up in that generation where things like music and film were a very sort of physical product and you’d have to wait until you could go into a town and buy the new album buy your favorite band or buy the new book and so on and that immediacy and the ease was just sort of mind blowing you could see that from day one and obviously the device itself has gone through several different iterations but that whole sort of ease of access and the ability to be able to just download within  seconds and get the book that you want to read i think was self evident from the first stages i remember thinking if some of my relatives who find it harder to get to a bookshop or those kind of situations it would be brilliant for them mark dawson it is one of the things that it’s very easy for us to take for granted now i downloaded and started to read a book on the train this morning as i was coming into london it’s easy because that’s become common behavior now to forget how revolutionary that would have seemed even  years ago the idea that you could do that you would have been burned as a witch probably if you were to suggest that so when you started you would have been out in slough i guess darren hardy yes indeed yes in slough mark dawson what did john betjeman say about that darren hardy yeah come friendly bombs mark dawson so i’ve been to the slough office in another life before i was writing not to meet you but to meet the guys in the video team that was a very different office to the sleek and shiny building that we’re in now and the main building in hoburne so how have you found how have things changed abouts organizationally as the time has gone past darren hardy well obviously the business has grown in size quite significantly over that time  i think that one of the amazing things and you mentioned earlier so when i first started at amazon the products that amazon sold were a far smaller product group and group of categories and so on it’s just grown phenomenally but then not only in terms of retail but then in terms of things like web services and some of the video side of things it’s just mind blowing just how many different aspects there are to the business as an employee obviously you become conscious of growing size and people coming into the teams all the time i think the great thing is there’s a real sense of excitement a momentum and new opportunities and one of the great things i think for many of the things that we do is that you identify an opportunity to try and help customers better or to try or to help authors better you get feedback “if only we could as an author do something” the particular thing is to be sort of try and see what we can do about that where we feel like there’s an opportunity to add value that shows no signs of slowing down you sort of think about all the innovation and all the change going on over the period of time that i’ve been here for example and you would think for many people “okay surely that’s it now it’s time to start leveling off and stick with what we’ve got” but i don’t think there’s any sign of that here just look at all the changes going on in the publishing space there’s still so much to do and so many opportunities mark dawson yeah james and i as we said before we started rolling today i mean alexa is a very exciting new technology just rolled out yesterday with the fire stick there’s lots of opportunities for readers and writers there as well maybe things will develop over the next few months and years james blatch how does that innovate … how does a large company because amazon is now a very large company on a corporate level how does it keep that culture of innovation going because that’s the big trick that lots of the other older companies are really struggling with they struggle to keep as fresh as they were when their forefathers started it darren hardy yes that’s really interesting and people have written books about exactly that it’s a fascinating aspect of it i think from my experience often you’ll hear reference about amazon leadership principles and things like that there are certain values that the business works to that have been there from day one and continue to be there and i think one of the amazing things is that that is a sort of a living breathing set of principles that do get referred to on a day by day basis and are often used to help solve problems or – james blatch so it’s not just a plaque on the wall at reception darren hardy that’s it james blatch it’s something you live by darren hardy yes that’s it and i think we often get asked that when we have people come in for interviews for example that’s obviously recruitment clearly is something that amazon does a lot of and often within the interview a candidate will as “what is this these amazon leadership principles i’ve heard about these what does it really mean” often we’ll talk about that fact that this is a genuine real living breathing set of values that the company works to making sure your customer is at the heart of what you do try and be innovative try and keep things simple i think that’s what helps keeps the momentum going because they are tried and tested they work really well for the amazon business and i think have been fundamental in many of the things that you’ve seen james blatch yeah mark dawson when you say you used the word customer a few times amazon is notoriously that’s the wrong word … is famous for being customercentric so who is your customer is it the reader or is it the writer darren hardy i think it’s both and many other customer types obviously as a retail business there is a retail customer who buys products on the retail website but then when it comes to business or a group like kindle direct publishing authors are obviously fundamental in what we do there’s a huge amount of focus in the way that people will talk publicly about the customer retail focus huge amount of focus in the author as our customer what can we do better where are we really helping what are the opportunities ahead of us yeah so i think it’s one of those things where i think we have a slightly split view on that clearly to help serve our customers as best as possible as authors we also need to serve our retail customers mark dawson you mentioned the team so how big is the team for kdp in london now darren hardy well it’s one of those interesting aspects of life here is that actually the team is quite geographically spread there’s a handful of us in the london office but equally we work very closely with colleagues in luxembourg there are obviously a number of businesses around europe that work very closely so i spend a lot of time talking to my counterparts in germany in france what’s working well what can we improve what are we hearing from authors similarly in the us obviously there’s a very large industry over there it’s one of the things that we try and do is learn from each other as well as spending a lot of time hearing from authors it’s also spending a lot of time talking internally about what’s going on in your particular area and can we learn from that even things that you hear from individual authors it may be the first time you might’ve heard something from an author in france but perhaps that’s a question that is equally relevant to the uk there’s a real global focus i think i think many authors are taking that kind of a perspective now the technology and the tools that are available mean that whereas in the past you might have considered yourself as an author to publishing to the uk for example it’s now just as easy to publish into australia into the us into countries all around the world why not cast your net as widely as you can to learn about readers in all of those countries as well i think it’s a similar process for us mark dawson yeah that’s really true something that i’ve discovered over the course of the last few years  of my readers are in the states so i’m publishing obviously in the uk but the vast majority are in the us i don’t know if you guys know there’s a piece of software called ‘book report’ it’s definitely worth checking it’s a clever little piece it’s a bookmark that you go into the kdp dashboard where the reports are and it will pull that data from the amazon servers and present it in a very visual fashion the insights you can get out of it are fantastic james blatch interesting mark dawson i have  of my sales in australia which i didn’t know so i’m going to focus my marketing on that as we go forwards james blatch yes mark dawson so … go on james james blatch i was going to say we talked about innovations and the heart of amazon so should we talk out one or two of the innovations of recent i mean really hot off the press literally the press is the change in press is the print side of things so obviously amazon acquired createspace a few years back whenever that was an eon in amazon terms we’ve looked at that and our students are familiar with that process what is the change that’s just been announced darren hardy so the main way of thinking about it is in the past as an author you would have signed up to kindle direct publishing and kindle direct publishing would have taken care of your digital publishing and you would then separately sign up to createspace and that createspace service would have taken care of your print book sales now basically you can access both of those things within kindle direct publishing so kindle direct publishing is the service that will enable you to digitally and in print some of the benefits of that include things like consolidated reporting for example so you’ll go to kdp and you’ll have reporting that will combine both of your print sales and your digital sales and a lot of the publishing process is made a lot simpler by the fact that you are going through a simple work flow if i can call it that with a clear “here’s your ebook details and here are your print book details” so you’re not having to go backwards and forwards between two different systems you can do it all within the same user interface as we call it the same sort of website from our perspective and the feedback that we’re getting is that from authors saying it’s just so much simpler it’s just so much easier to go into one place and do all of it in one go and get that one set of reports so as you say we’ve just sort of announced that this beater is ongoing but there’ll obviously be changes and updates to come as we go along so watch the space keep looking at the website you’ll keep seeing new features coming on as we can add them and send us your feedback james blatch and the fee structure will be comparable for authors darren hardy in terms of the structure of publishing none of that’s changed all of your royalty rates are the same essentially it’s sort of consolidating what’s already there  so yeah mark dawson do you think … i mean i’m definitely impressed with bringing in that under one dashboard just the fact that you see the data more often means you’re more likely to focus on the data and concentrate on developing it do you think … most of my books are on createspace do you think it’s likely that those will be consolidated so that the data will be available under the kdp dash in a year or twos time darren hardy yeah i mean with any beater obviously the service is there as is at the moment we’re aware that there are things that we’ll be adding over time i think wherever there are pain points or inefficiencies from an author perspective we would always be looking to see what we can do about those so yeah i think the key thing with those kind of questions is sort of sign up give it a go see how it works for you let us know what you think and we’ll continue to sort of build on it over time mark dawson okay so you have an unusual position in that you have this birds eye view of indie publishing and have done for some time obviously i was … when i was on the radio though amazon very kindly have put me forward for press things and i was on the radio not too long ago and one of the first questions i got was from the host it was very polite but it was basically “i don’t know who you are” and i could have answered that in a number of ways but i answered as politely as i could do you find … how do you think perception of independent publishing has changed over say the last five years darren hardy it’s really interesting because i think as an industry we talk a lot about the difference between traditional publishing independent publishing and all of those kind of things from a reader’s perspective i don’t think there’s a huge amount of awareness or concern to be honest about that sort of split i think the key thing is can i read a good book is this an author i particularly like and how that author chooses to publish the book i think is relatively immaterial i think we as an industry spend a lot of time discussing these things i think from a reader’s perspective actually it’s not really that important but i think what is becoming sort of growing awareness is just how easy it is and how much impact you can have as an independently published author  i should imagine many aspiring authors will always … you’re thinking “okay i’m going to write a book how do i go about it” from various searches you’ll read various articles and all of those kind of things and i think you can see a real sort of sense within that sort of commentary that independent publishing is becoming so successful that many authors are just sort of getting on with it and almost not spending a huge amount of time debating about which way to go it’s like “well i can do this now i can do it really quickly independently publishing so that’s the route i’m going to try” i think that sort of helps build that success clearly your appearance on the radio show whilst they may have said “well i don’t exactly know who you are” figures that you no doubt talked about in that interview spoke for themselves i think in terms of the success that you found mark dawson well i was reasonably modest i was tempted not to be james blatch i mean the biggest area of lack of knowledge is in the traditional publishing area because there it’s not everywhere within it but we’ve certainly had a couple of voices in the last few months sort of been … a very common one i get independently publishing it says oh you talk about an editor “well where do you get an editor from”  as if anybody just goes to a word document uploads their book and there’s a lack of understanding and the trad industry that they go through the same process books go through the same process we’ve had a little bit and i wonder how you’ll react when you hear some of the traditional voices saying that the loss of the gatekeeper is a bad thing for readers because it’s exposing them to books that haven’t gone through that long process of long lunches before the book finally arrives darren hardy yeah i mean it’s interesting cause i think for many … certainly the authors i speak to this has been hugely liberating it’s actually something which has enabled them to sort of just get on with publishing mark dawson inaudible  darren hardy yeah exactly there’s a classic example and you hear so many examples authors talking about the fact that they were trying to get published there were people saying “this isn’t the right genre for this time” or “we’ve already published these particular books we don’t need anymore” all various reasons which probably make perfect sense for those particular people but from the author’s perspective it’s “well why is that holding me back i just want to get on with it and let the reader decide who becomes successful” because it’s all very well for one or two people to make a judgment and they probably have a huge amount of knowledge and experience but actually the people that really matter are the readers so being able to get on with it i think has been incredibly liberating for many authors and as you say actually certainly the events that i go to most independently published authors know very well how to find an editor or they know who to ask when it comes to cover design you can go to events you can read blogs there’s all sorts of ways in which you can find out about those things i don’t think from an independent publishing authors perspective any of this is a secret i think actually it’s just a fact of life when you’re publishing james blatch yeah i mean i was on radio  as well faced with this on you and yours a little while ago faced with this exact argument and i flipped it on its head and made the point that every jk rowling every ian rankin will tell you how many rejection letters they got mark dawson absolutely james blatch now those people had the tenacity to get through it but how many brilliant writers fell at that stage how many we’ve never heard from never seen their books but actually in this day and age we now do so for me it was as you say liberating is a great word for it i think darren hardy yeah and i think that the processes the tools that you have are so simple now james blatch yeah darren hardy it’s so easy to be independently published probably the biggest sort of point of debate is “am i going to do this as an author am i going to spend the time to write this book to dedicate a lot of time to crafting something that i want to publish” because once you get to that point of thinking “yes i am and i have now got a finished product” the rest of it is relatively straight forward james blatch it’s actually quite hard writing a book isn’t it darren hardy exactly right mark dawson let’s not get darren started on that one darren has been telling me he’s going to write a book for a couple of years now i always bug him darren hardy yes james blatch it’s really hard darren hardy it is exactly that i learned from mark’s example sort of being on a train commuting in to work you think “i’ve got this time to write a book” whereas mark was very diligent and got the book written i tend to fall asleep so that’s obviously what slows me down james blatch he’s an outlier mark dawson okay  so we mentioned kind of a “when” so we go to london book fair and other events there’s a great event in dublin not too long ago which had a big audience it’s easy for us in our little selfpublishing bubble if you’d like to assume that everyone knows what we know and to assume that everyone knows that it’s possible to publish in a way that has nothing to do with vanity publishing and all of that kind of stuff so how do … how far do you think the message has spread i would … do you think we’ve … let’s say there’s  writers do you think  of them now know that this is a viable option or more or less darren hardy yeah it’s a really interesting question i think it’s one of those things where awareness continues to grow but i still think there’s more that can be done i think the really interesting thing is the way that the tools and the processes are becoming so simple actually and to the point you sort of made there are many people who have probably only had in the back of their mind the idea that they might become a writer they’re the people that actually be incredibly enthused by the ease of the process and just by actually taking up the opportunity now so you sort of think about the author community as it is today then yes there may be different levels of awareness whether you’re traditionally published whether you’re independently published whatever it might be but actually there’s a really interesting opportunity for lots of different types of people to publish stories for them and it’s not always about becoming a number one best seller it’s not always about getting to a chart or making  pounds or whatever it might be it’s just the incredible sort of sense of achievement to publish a book and have some people read it and ideally leave some great reviews you know why not  there’s this terrible cliché that we always mention “everyone’s got a book in them”  why not you know  as long as you’re realistic about what you want to do and how you want to be involved with it then why not james blatch we shouldn’t be afraid to talk about the money as well keeping a significantly larger percentage of the sale price of the book is a quicker route to the kind of liberation that mark’s enjoyed of quitting his job and it is more difficult to do that traditionally publishing you have to sell the math is simple you have to sell a lot more books to have that kind of income darren hardy yes mark dawson absolutely so again you’ve got a lot of experience and you’ve been on the ground for a long time now so what’s the best story that you’ve … from an author’s perspective that you’ve heard darren hardy wow  there’s so many i mean yours james blatch don’t mention him mark dawson come on darren hardy sorry sorry but yes i mean yours is one that i’m constantly referring to because it is one of those that clearly you’ve put a huge amount of work into this and you shouldn’t underestimate just how much focus you’ve had on the writing and on the business side but that classic situation somebody on a train commuting in to work sort of having some thought about wanting to publish a book and making it happen is incredible and there are so many others somebody we’ve spoken to many times louise ross lj ross is a classic example of being on a train looking out a window seeing in her case lindisfarne island thinking “somebody should write a book set there actually why don’t i write that book set there” that’s fabulous story because it’s just something that everybody will no doubt have done in their lives just looked out a window and thought “hmm that’s interesting” and there are many many others i think the great thing is that these examples it’s not like there was some sort of unique epiphany that only you could have experienced it’s the sort of situation that anybody could have been in now it takes a certain tenacity to make it happen but anybody could be in that situation i think that’s what’s really inspiring and that’s what’s really inspiring for me in the work that i do i get to meet people like you and many other authors every day and every story i just think “yeah isn’t that incredible that person’s taken the opportunity and made it work for them” as i say it’s not always necessarily about saying “great thank you i’ve got to number one” it’s just “ people have downloaded my book isn’t that amazing” yeah if that’s what you’re looking for that is amazing mark dawson i even remember very vividly actually this is going back to  now i remember the first time i had a sale that i didn’t think was from someone who i knew james blatch your mum mark dawson my mum yeah buying lots of copies that was a pretty amazing moment then the first time someone i didn’t know signed up to my mailing list or left a review those are small way points along the journey but they were at the time they were as exciting as getting traditional deal or seeing my print books on storefronts and that kind of thing darren hardy and i think that’s one of the key things as an author as a and aspiring author as a budding author to think about what it is that you want mark dawson yeah darren hardy because yes you could think “i want to be the world’s most famous author”  that’s clearly a very big challenge to set yourselves it may be “i just want to sell  copies to people i don’t know and get maybe one or two customer reviews”  there’s obviously a myriad of things in between those two points just sort of work accordingly and that will determine part of your strategies as it were in terms of publishing what do i want to get out of this as an author therefore what am i prepared to put into it james blatch yeah that’s something we often refer to on the podcast isn’t it and j penn summed it up with that key question you have to ask yourself is “what does success look like to you”  and once you’ve answered that a lot of things become easier it brings a focus to where you’re going mark dawson so you mentioned a strategy so we have to take … i’m going to stand in for james here this is where james gets his money’s worth so james is a new author just working through his first book hopefully he’ll get it he’s very lazy but he’ll get it ready by the end of the year what would your advice be to writers like james who are thinking now “how should i publish my book” maybe a common or traditional and also then what the options are available independently darren hardy i think one of the key things to bear in mind is to spend that time getting the book right i think because the publishing process can be so quick and so simple there’s almost like a tendency to want to get to that as quickly as you can but you really have to spend the time making the book as strong as you can and being really proud of it i think that’s one of the things that we often hear from authors is making sure you’ve go the edit right making sure you’re really happy with the cover design and just because you can put it somewhere very quickly don’t think that the speed is the real aim it’s to put something out there that you can be proud of so i think yes make the time get the book right and then as we’ve said actually think about what your priorities are think about do you want to do certain things yourself we often hear from people who’ve written a book but maybe they have a background in marketing maybe they have a background in graphic design or whatever it might be so therefore they want to do the cover design or they want to do their marketing plan but equally if there are certain areas that you are less comfortable with do you want to try and outsource that do you want to hire somebody do you want to get some advice for those sorts of things the author community especially the independent author community is incredibly generous with its time and advice spend the time to think about what you want and get lots of advice about how best to go about that because i think there’s very rarely one solution that fits for everybody it’s usually a question of well this is the bit i want in this are this is the bit i want from that area that is the package that’s going to work for me and that’s what i’m going to go with and then learn and try and test one of the great things about independent publishing is you have so much flexibility if you try a certain price point and you don’t think it’s working for you then you can go back and change it if you put up a product description and you think on reflection maybe that’s not quite saying to my readers what i want to say you can go back and change it so constantly see it as a learning process and calibrate it in the ways that are going to work for you james blatch the two strands to the business and the author both have their challenges you must come across people … the way you described yourself at the beginning as somebody surrounded by books and from a family that were readers and had books everywhere i think some people might be a little surprised to think of you in amazon probably the detractors think that it’s full of young kids who don’t care about the … they see it as a product it’s digital business and some people do look at it rather negatively actually you obviously adore books and you come from that area and you almost represent the person who might struggle with the business side of things might struggle with all the technology you obviously don’t you worked in the heart of it but that must be something your readers talk to you occasionally about but just don’t understand it darren hardy from a readers point – james blatch sorry i meant writer’s just … i don’t understand it darren hardy absolutely  with any profession you have people in all sorts of different backgrounds looking at how they work in that profession i think we’re … it’s certainly something we’re very mindful of is we’re always looking to try to make the tools and processes as simple as possible and try and explain them as clearly as possible but of course you have to deal with people with a lot of different backgrounds and so it’s not like a finished process where you think “okay that’s done it’s really simple we can now move one”  we’re constantly listening and trying to see how we can make things even better i think again as an independent author you have the choice so if you’re thinking actually i want some technical advice about how to design a cover let’s say then you have that opportunity it’s not that you have to do it in one particular way similarly with the marketing side of things there are plenty of people out there who will give you lots of advice about how to market now you can listen to that advice and decide whether it’s right for you but there’s lots of help out there to help you make those decisions whilst you’re independently publishing and there’s that sense that you think “okay i’m an individual publishing on my own” actually there’s a huge community out there that you can engage with equally if the idea of talking to any other person about your book is something you definitely don’t want to do then you don’t have to either you can work on your own and make it happen in the way that you want it’s one of those things where again you decide it’s for you to make that choice mark dawson a few closing questions now just in terms of best practice what would you say is the error that you see most often in terms of books that are coming up on the platform darren hardy i don’t know in terms of errors i think the advice that we often hear is make sure that you have spent time researching what you’re doing treat it as a business mark this is something that you’ve said many times treat it as a business and treat it seriously if you want to make a big impact or make a big impact with your publishing think about your cover design think about your product description how’s that going to work with your readers and is it sort of conveying the messages that you want it to convey i think the other thing is again think about how much work do you wan to put into your publishing we have all sorts of tools and processes we have programs like kdp select that you can use to try promotions many authors now are very busy active on social media if you are serious about trying to become a bestseller in however you choose to define that then it’s going to take some work so you need to think about how that’s going to happen you can’t just publish the book and then sit back and think “great i’ll now wait and then next week i will be at number one and an international bestseller”  so if they’re the kind of things you’re aiming for then think about the plan put a plan together and structure it as you would a business mark dawson yeah that’s very good advice how many books are on the platform now live darren hardy that’s a very good question millions i mean when you look at the kindle store in the uk there are millions of books on the website and clearly it continues to grow mark dawson that’s one of the things that i think quite strongly that there’s almost certainly been the next great british novel has probably been published in the last five years has probably been published independently and probably or might not be noticed because their author isn’t comfortable with the marketing side of things you’re right it does need to be treated in a businesslike fashion if you want to sell significant amounts of copies let’s just say … you have james james is published and he wants to get amazon’s attention what would be the best way of doing that darren hardy well i think the key thing is to get your reader’s attention and build a readership for your book  so i think the best ways of doing that are again assuming that you want to is to start talking to your readership create a mailing list if that’s what you want to do create a facebook page if that’s what you want to do we’re always looking as everybody does we’re always looking at the charts you mentioned earlier around the nature of the people in the amazon business and in kindle direct publishing there are many many book lovers here and we’re constantly debating the great new read that you’ve read or having an argument about a book that somebody loves and somebody else didn’t quite sort of warm to so we’re always looking at what’s in our charts and we’re always looking at those authors that are seeing success the way that the amazon website works is so much of it is driven by recommendation that’s sort of tailored to the individual reader the individual customer so if your book is being looked at by readers is being bought by readers that will enable our recommendation systems to then recommend that book to other readers you can sort of see the snowball then building in terms of getting in front of even more readers thinking about whether you want to participate with something like kindle unlimited so joining kdp select having that  day period of exclusivity in return for participating in kdp select having access to promotional deals those sorts of things all of that helps build that momentum and drive sales it’s well worth thinking about those james blatch does the business the way it’s set out with the algorithms etc lend itself more to clearly define genres than the kind of genre indefinable book darren hardy that’s a very interesting question i think the whole idea of having genrebased readers is becoming much more blurred now i guess that idea that if you walked into a bookshop or into a library or into a physical location you’d have to have a certain organization to your shelving to make it browsable online you have infinite shelving as a reader you get recommendations based on all sorts of different parameters i don’t think it’s as important perhaps but i think as an author if you’re trying especially if you’re starting out if you’re trying to find a readership for your books then you probably do need to have a reasonably clear idea of what type of reader you’re aiming for and that might be genrebased it might be lifestylebased it may be that you have written a book that you think would be really interesting for young mums or retired people or whatever it might be so then your marketing strategy or you approach may differ if that’s the sort of area that you’re going for genre’s part of it but i wouldn’t say it’s all of it mark dawson james is pitching for raf veterans from the ’’s he used to like vulcan bombers james blatch it’s not as narrow as you think mark dawson i should actually warn you we spoke to alex clarke from wildfire from headliner and james pitched his book and now alex wants to read the damned thing so i’m sure before we leave the office today james will be in your ear about getting it in kdp james blatch inundated with offers yeah mark dawson it’s been really generous the time you’ve given us darren we’ve been speaking for about an hour so i think we’ll wrap it up there so thank you once again for taking the time james blatch yeah i meant what i said it’s really heartening to know that at the center of this big digital transformational business is somebody who loves books and sees the technology as an enabler of matching readers to writers which is how it should be so thank you for your time darren hardy no problem at all thank you james blatch so darren hardy at amazon in london obviously one of the key guys in the uk for a large company as you say laid back guy and fascinating to talk to him to talk to the horses mouth and they are such a large organization that for most authors they never get that kind of personal relationship that you’ve got with them and obviously for people like adam croft and yourself and people who’ve risen above the rest if you like the rest of us that’s a unique thing but very good of them to come onto the podcast and share some of that background with us mark dawson yeah they don’t do it very often i’ve only heard darren on one podcast before and i’ve keened to get him on because there’s obviously lots of things that we can ask him before we did the interview i put a message into our facebook group and asked for people to send in questions they’d like us to put to him i think it’s reasonable to say a fair number perhaps half to  of those questions could have been termed negative questions james blatch yeah mark dawson frustrations and why is it like this and why can’t amazon do that which is fair enough what i think about when i think about amazon is they are the dominant player in the market but i think they deserve that they took a chance on the kindle however many years ago it was now perhaps even pushing eight or nine years ago they developed the technology they developed the best selfpublishing platform and the kdp is a very very easy platform to use it’s much easier than almost all of the other ones they’ve got the biggest reach you can publish worldwide with the click of the button in literally  minutes really once your assets are in place that wouldn’t have come cheap taking a risk on a piece of new kit especially when you see people saying “i’m never going to swap i love my print book”  i’m looking at my book now with print books and i love the smell of a book and i love the feel of a book i was one of those doubtful very late adopters i didn’t get to kindle until quite late but amazon gambled on that okay so now they’re the biggest player but they deserve to be when no one else was putting their neck on the line and developing something like that james blatch yeah  that’s always always the case particularly i think it might be a british mentality often i think of coldplay as an example of this if you do become a huge thing in your field suddenly people decide they don’t like you it’s an odd thing about coldplay you probably don’t know them but if you mention coldplay within  seconds someone around you will say “i hate coldplay” mark dawson i hate coldplay james blatch yeah there you go i think it’s because they’re successful because if i mentioned jesus and mary chain it’s unlikely someone would say “i hate jesus and mary chain” they just wouldn’t say it because they’re not successful when you are … and amazon are dominant and successful you’re always going to get some detractors because that’s part of human nature but they do it well and as you say they had a vision i’m probably one of those people who sat around the … where we used to work in the bbfc when they said people aren’t going to be buying dvds and bluray’s in the future and i took a while to be convinced that you should invest in this area there was no hesitation in jeff bezos’s household where he decided this was almost certainly as far as he was concerned going to be the way it’s going and they put their eggs in that basket and boy it’s paid off mark dawson yeah as we say in salisbury “haters gonna hate” james blatch yeah mark dawson and that’s fine amazon is an enormous company obviously let’s say something blindingly obvious they’re an enormous company with enormous revenues i’ve been to see their distribution center in  milton keynes and it’s absolutely it would blow your mind how big it is it is so vast almost impossible to describe and with that kind of success inevitably will come questions and authors who are frustrated that they can’t make their book sell sometimes they’ll lash out and blame the platform rather than perhaps blame the book maybe it’s a book problem or maybe it’s a marketing problem so i think amazon doesn’t get everything right there are issues with ku i’m not in the kindle unlimited for a number of reasons the system has been scammed a bit recently by people uploading garbage basically and then clickfarming all the way to the end of the book so they get their per pages read thing unfortunately amazon is trying to deal with that it’s a difficult problem to solve and in the sweep up some innocent authors have been caught up and and had their books pulled that’s not great there have been cases where slightly unpleasant emails have been automated emails go out when perhaps it wouldn’t necessarily have been the thing to do that’s an economy of scale thing it would be very difficult for amazon to employ a  customer service helpers – james blatch yeah mark dawson to deal with those problems i think a level of automation is necessary you can usually get things appealed you can usually reach a person by replying to those emails and get things fixed james blatch yeah it is without question it is the number one struggle for companies that just grow to that scale is keeping some sort of personal … you can deal with the routine it’s dealing with the things that are slightly outside the routine that becomes very people intensive i’ve been in the wrong side of ebay a couple of times innocently trying to sell something mark dawson oh yeah james blatch innocently selling something sellers decide to return it on spurious grounds even though the description was accurate and on both occasions they immediately have ruled against me because they’ve just made this blanket decision that they’re going to … i don’t know if you google this i’m not the only one i won’t sell on ebay anymore and i think they have struggled to do that struggled to bridge that gap why are you laughing mark dawson just thinking about your james blatch adult toys james blatch that was not what i was selling it was a macbook pro anyway so but my feeling with amazon is that they make earnest attempts to try and do that i know it’s frustrating and there will be people who listen to this podcast who have had their accounts shut down through no fault of their own and then struggled to get repairs but um – mark dawson probably not you don’t hear that very often that kind of draconian shut down is very unusual they may have had issues that have needed to be remedied one thing to say is a really good way if people are in london and they’re going to the london boat fair obviously we’ll be there james blatch yeah mark dawson one thing i would recommend is amazon will be there probably i haven’t had it confirmed yet but i think it’s in the author hq they have a lot of stuff darren will be there and they are very approachable very open to people going up to the stall introducing themselves come and meet us i’d be happy to introduce anyone to the guys at amazon it’s really good way just to you know get some advice from amazon james blatch yeah mark dawson they’re very happy to reach out – james blatch there’s an opportunity to have a personal chat with someone from amazon mark dawson yeah james blatch yeah so talking about lbf the london book fair if you’re coming over to the uk or you’re in the uk and going to visit we will be there for the three or four days of the week and we’re going to have a little get together on the wednesday night so we’re going to announce the venue in our facebook groups if you join “ads for authors – self publishing formula” and “ads for authors” facebook group or actually we’ll put it into all the groups we’ll give you the venue as soon as we resolve that but we will go out and buy some drinks for people who’ve come up and said “hello” and identified themselves as spf community members by what do you say one trouser leg rolled up and the secret handshake mark dawson i need to work on that james blatch yeah mark dawson one of james’ elicite products … you can wave your james blatch love doll james blatch this is libelous do you know a lawyer mark dawson i do i am a lawyer james blatch yeah exactly sue yourself mark dawson it’s not liable if it’s true anyway … move on james blatch that’s one of the defense … actually that’s not a defense of liable the defense is you’ve got to be able to prove it whether it’s true or not that’s like course work anyway getting bogged down brilliant to have amazon on the spf podcast and thank you very much indeed to them for taking their time we’ll definitely revisit that in the future we’ve got some exciting stuff coming up we’re going to really delve deeply into some paid advertising areas including ams the new platform on amazon but also facebook ads in the next few weeks we’ve got a very exciting author interview coming up in the next few weeks as well with holly ward one of the biggest selling romance authors on the planet an absolutely lovely woman who does not do interviews very often and did a brilliant interview for us for spf so very exciting thank you so much indeed for listening you can get all the podcasts back on our website selfpublishingformulacom you can email us podcastselfpublishingformulacom please do join our facebook groups our growing array of facebook groups whether they are specifically for your genre or generally for advice so ads for authors is probably the main one what’s the other one not genius because that’s links the
