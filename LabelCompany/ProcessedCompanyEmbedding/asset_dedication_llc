how does the asset dedication strategy work step  secure future cash flow needs whether a client is saving for a down payment on their first home preparing for their initial years of retirement or looking to protect their principal for another cash flow need they should have investments that can help them fulfill those needs regardless of how the market reacts given this we purchase fixed income securities to generate the specific cash flow when it’s needed most  learn more… predictable cash flows principal protection rising interest rate management step  align growth investments with timebased goals the market has repeatedly shown us that the longer you remain invested in equities the greater your chance of seeing higher returns however most investors cannot afford to leave their

meet with a team member how we build a client’s critical path® step  collect financial planning information since the critical path acts as the vehicle to display a portfolio in the context of the financial plan we first need to collect the core financial planning information some pieces of information include age goal and the goal’s time horizon investable assets net desired cash flows desired

and provide the historical probabilities of success for the proposed financial plan and investments by showing investments in the context of the financial plan the feasibility of the client’s goals are shown in a historically significant manner which may allow you to keep or get your client on track below are some charts and tables that we typically include in our critical path proposals historical portfolio auditprobability of success table in each proposal our goal is to show you if your client’s proposed portfolio is realistic or if planning changes need to be made to show how realistic the proposed financial plan may be we create the chart shown in the chart the white dotted line shows what needs to happen for your client to meet their goals and the yellow lines show how a representative strategy performed during every longevitymatched period going back to  for scenarios that fall short in the chart no adjustments like reducing withdrawals or changing asset allocation were made to prevent early depletion as part of the client’s annual critical path review we provide you with recommendations to help keep your clients on track to meet their financial goals chart

process no matter how positive historical audits have been over any time period the potential for loss is always present due to factors which may not be accounted for in the historical audit the

investing with the goal of delivering a representative portfolio below is an example of how we may have implemented a client’s portfolio predictably match income needstimealign equities with income securities before building the growth portfolio we purchase fixedmaturity income securities that match the client’s projected accountspecific spending needs doing so our goal is to protect principal and give the client flexibility to ride through down markets without having to sell their growth securities at a discount click here to learn more about the income portfolio the table shows securities that we may have purchased in an attempt to match cash flows to a client’s future spending needs  the table is being shown for illustrative purposes only we sourced the securities listed in the table on  because the fixed income market is constantly changing the securities used to create this table should not be interpreted as representative of the current fixed income market the projected cash flows do not represent a guarantee individual fixed income securities have the potential for default each security is assumed to be held to maturity individual securities reflect yield to maturity yield calculations for inflationindexed securities include an assumption for future inflation we typically timealign a client’s income portfolio with their growth portfolio with the goal of improving the client’s probability of reaching their timebased goals for example if a client has income securities that are projected to meet the next ten years of their spending needs we may purchase a growth portfolio that is designed to maximize their minimum returns over a  year time horizon learn more   chart disclosures the chart uses historical index data from a number of providers to create a
