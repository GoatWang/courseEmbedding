bank kimberlite to focus on advice by william alden october    pm october    pm photothomas f oneill left and michael d coster two of the founding principals of the kimberlite groupcredit tina fineberg for the new york times wall street’s big banks advertise themselves as fullservice shops boasting that they can offer a range of services to institutional clients but one new investment bank is taking the opposite approach the kimberlite group a boutique firm that will open its doors on tuesday says its specialized focus is a benefit the firm plans to offer only advice and merchant banking services without underwriting lending or trading businesses and it plans to focus on two areas — real estate and financial institutions the business model is heavily dependent on the combined rolodexes of the four founding principals led by thomas f o’neill a founder of the investment bank sandler o’neill and michael d coster who once ran the real estate fund advisory group at lazard by taking a narrow focus they hope to avoid the possible conflicts that can come with bigger firms “it gets to be a little unwieldy” the yearold mr o’neill said “we felt we could be of better service to our clients by being independent” the founders — who also include kenneth b hamlet a former chief executive of holiday inns and alan j pomerantz a senior counsel at pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman — started kimberlite by buying the real estate advisory unit of ranieri partners where mr o’neill and mr coster most recently worked that deal closed in september mr o’neill who ran the financial services group at ranieri partners after  years at sandler o’neill said that he was splitting from ranieri because of a desire to move to a smaller operation and that the separation was amicable lewis s ranieri the chairman of ranieri partners who is known on wall street as a pioneer of mortgage securities will be a senior adviser to kimberlite in the years since the financial crisis boutique investment banks have gained market share by emphasizing their specialization by refraining from publishing research or trading for their own account their argument goes smaller banks can avoid conflicts of interest the giants of wall street rule the rankings of deal advisers but small banks have had prominent roles in some big deals this year including the  billion sale of hj heinz in which lazard was the lead adviser to the buyers berkshire hathaway and g capital lazard currently ranks th this year in worldwide mergers and acquisitions by value according to thomson reuters two small banks that have sprung up in recent years have climbed to formidable positions in the league tables moelis  company which was founded in  by kenneth d moelis a former ubs banker ranks th worldwide while centerview partners founded in  is in th place thomson reuters data shows to stand out as a small bank it helps to be narrowly focused said joel jeffrey an analyst at keefe bruyette  woods “the firms that focus primarily on the advisory side of the business are likely to be more successful than ones that do more of a farreaching and comprehensive brokerage platform” mr jeffrey said “people are valuing advice that is independent from where they get the financing” at the same time big banks have shown that there remains plenty of demand for the fullservice model jpmorgan chase which is ranked third in the thomson reuters league table said in its  annual report that its “scale and broad crossmarket capabilities” like offering both advice and financing for deals were useful for clients but kimberlite’s role is different from that of the big banks said mr coster who is a cochief executive of the new firm along with mr o’neill catering to institutional investors real estate companies and financial firms kimberlite is aiming to act as a trusted adviser “nobody can distribute product faster or more efficiently than wall street but it’s still a product” mr coster  said “we’re helping clients think through what the right product is” kimberlite — whose name refers to the volcanic rock in which diamonds can be found — has more than a dozen active engagements with clients in its real estate and financial groups said mr coster who runs the firm’s real estate practice mr o’neill runs the financial institutions group and mr hamlet is chairman of the firm mr o’neill the most senior banker in the room isn’t the only kimberlite founder to have started a small bank in the past after leaving lazard mr coster cofounded occom capital partners which was sold to ranieri partners in  with just  employees including its founders kimberlite is settling into office space in midtown manhattan that it is subletting from ellis lake capital a paper sign with the firm’s name was hanging last week from the office door but the firm is more established than its spare environs suggest a table in the office was cluttered with lucite tombstones a visual reminder of the many deals done by the founders over the years “this is not a startup” mr o’neill said “it’s an old business just a new company” whats next loading previous post cuban says he was taken aback by

tdem survey at lulo identifies  new electromagnetic em conductive kimberlite exploration targets of up to  hectares with little or no previous magnetic signature   ·     of the new em targets are located along drainage systems feeding into the highinterest mining block  area a prolific producer of large and premiumvalue alluvial diamonds further three located near the previouslydefined ll area of interest   ·    tdem data and reinterpretation of existing magnetic data has also enabled all kimberlite targets in the cacuilo valley to be reclassified in order of prospectivity   ·    this reclassification and accessibility will guide updated  drilling laboratory analysis and sampling programs which aim to identify the primary kimberlite sources of the exceptional lulo alluvial diamonds first laboratory results due this quarter   ·    lulo kimberlite exploration program now funded from lucapas share of distributions from the lulo alluvial mining operations thus achieving primary objectives lucapa diamond company limited asx lom lucapa or the company and its partners empresa nacional de diamantes ep endiama and rosas  petalas are pleased to provide an update on the kimberlite exploration program at the lulo diamond project in angola   the kimberlite exploration program aims to locate the primary hard rock sources of the large and premiumvalue lulo alluvial diamonds production from which lulo achieved the highest per carat sale prices us in the world in    the latest step in the lulo kimberlite exploration program involved a helicopterborne time domain electromagnetic tdem survey flown over the cacuilo river valley and its main tributaries where lucapa and its partners have identified extensive alluvial diamond deposits   the skytem m survey was flown between february and april  in one block comprising km of flight lines   the lines were spaced at a nominal m flown in a northsouth direction with tie lines at m intervals flown in an eastwest direction at a nominal terrain clearance of m electromagnetic em and magnetic data was collected along with terrain elevation   the tdem survey completes the airborne geophysical tools to be used by the lulo partners to guide and update the ongoing kimberlite drilling program by identifying new non or low magnetic targets and to provide further definition of magnetic targets previously identified from aeromagnetic surveys flown over the entire km  lulo concession by fugro airborne surveys in  and     new em targets identified the tdem results identified  new kimberlite targets within the cacuilo river valley area demonstrating conductive em signatures figures  with little or no discernible magnetic signatures these new mapped targets range in size up to  hectares   of the  new targets five g g g g and g are located along drainage systems feeding into the mining block  area figure  which has been a regular source of large and premiumvalue irregular shaped and jagged edged alluvial diamonds   another three of the new em targets g g and g are located further southeast along the cacuilo river near the ll kimberlite area figures  and  this region was previously highlighted as an area of exploration interest due to favourable mineral chemistry results including a microdiamond and g garnets see asx announcement  december      reclassification of existing kimberlite targets analysis of the tdem data and the reinterpretation of existing magnetic data highlighted  priority one kimberlite targets within the cacuilo valley area figure    these targets all demonstrated strongly conductive em signatures supporting the existence of favourable nearsurface pyroclastic kimberlite pk material associated with kimberlite pipes many of these priority one targets are also located along topographical drainage systems feeding into the mining block  area and the ll area of interest to the southeast   apart from the strength of their em signatures the priority one kimberlite targets are also predominantly large ha ranging in size up to ha     a further  emmagnetic kimberlite targets were classified as priority two and three   these targets are in addition to the seven kimberlites l l l l l l and l  figure  from which drill core has already been dispatched to cape town for laboratory analysis see asx announcement  july    next steps  systematic drilling laboratory analysis and bulk sampling the tdem results have enabled the lulo geological team to update the ongoing kimberlite drilling program while three drilling rigs are currently available the lulo partners will consider allocating additional resources to this program   kimberlite drilling will continue at lulo for the remainder of  with the aim of extracting core from the priority targets identified from the tdem results this systematic drilling program will also include a planned deep hole at the l target figure  when ground conditions permit   the core from this ongoing drilling program will be dispatched to cape town for laboratory analysis periodically throughout the program   as detailed in the asx announcement of  july  the laboratory analysis process involves crushing the drill core and extracting kimberlite indicator minerals including garnet ilmenite chrome spinel chrome diopside and zircon from heavy liquid concentrates these indicator minerals are then analysed using an electron microprobe to determine their mineral chemistry   the mineral chemistry results are in turn used to prioritise likely diamondiferous kimberlite pipes for follow up geological work including further drilling and bulk sampling to test for diamond content and grade future kimberlite bulk sampling programs will have to include processing of large tonnages to get meaningful data as a result of the lowgrade highvalue nature of the lulo diamond resource   as previously advised the lulo partners expect to receive the results during the september  quarter from the first batch of kimberlite samples undergoing laboratory analysis in cape town   alluvial channels apart from defining kimberlite targets the tdem survey was also used to identify shallow conductive horizons along the cacuilo river associated with alluvial channels these areas will be tested using the sedidrill rig to determine the presence of potential diamondbearing gravel   funding in place as previously advised lucapa will fund the kimberlite drilling program from the companys share of prorata distributions from the lulo alluvial mining operations this includes the us million distribution million declared in may    for an on behalf of the lucapa board   stephen wetherall managing director   about lucapa        lucapa diamond company limited is a growing diamond company with a portfolio of highquality production development and exploration assets in angola lesotho botswana and australia the companys focus on highvalue production is designed to protect cash flows as pricing in this sector of the diamond market remains robust   lucapas flagship asset is the lulo diamond project in angola which produced the highest  per carat price of any run of mine diamond production in the world in  and continues to produce some of the largest diamonds on record from that region lucapa and its lulo partners are also welladvanced in their search for the primary source of these large and premiumvalue alluvial diamonds with three rigs now available to drill priority kimberlite targets   in keeping with the companys growth strategy lucapa has secured a  interest in the advanced highquality mothae kimberlite project in lesotho which is located in the heart of the worlds highestvalue cluster of kimberlite mines lucapa plans to commence production at mothae in    lucapa has also defined drilling targets at two earlierstage diamond projects  orapa area f in botswanas orapa diamond field and brooking in the west kimberley lamproite province in western australia   lucapas

generated from a  rise in mining volumes to  bulk cubic metres bcm leaving sml on track to achieve record and targeted annual production of  bcm for calendar    the grade of the diamonds recovered during the quarter improved  to  carats per  cubic metres while the average size of the diamonds recovered was steady at  carats   mining operations in april and may  were focused primarily on mining

average prices for the quarter and comparative periods   alluvial exploration   mining and exploration activities at lulo have been focused on the cacuilo river valley area which runs for more than km through the south west of the lulo concession   during the quarter the lulo partners conducted their first exploration along the lulo river which is within the awarded km mining licence area this is with the aim of establishing economic resource areas along the much larger and longer lulo river to add to the current inferred alluvial jorc resource   this involved constructing a km road northeast from the cacuilo river mining operations to the lulo river to enable the mobile sedidrill rig to access this area   the sedidrill was successful in recovering alluvial gravels further drilling is being planned to define sufficient gravels for a bulk sample to test for diamond content quality and grade   kimberlite exploration   the lulo kimberlite exploration program is designed to locate the primary hardrock sources of the exceptional quality and value alluvial diamonds being mined along the cacuilo river valley area within the km lulo concession   exploration has historically been focused on magnetic targets identified from previous airborne aeromagnetic surveys in the alluvial areas where large and premiumvalue diamonds have been recovered and where there is also supporting geological evidence of proximal kimberlite pipes   in april  the new hanjin db drilling rig was commissioned at lulo after being shipped to angola from korea this increased to three the number of rigs available for drilling during the quarter to further the kimberlite exploration program   during the quarter an  line km helicopterborne time domain electromagnetic tdem survey was completed over the cacuilo river valley area the analysis and interpretation of this data is in the final stage with the results imminent     the tdem survey was designed to guide and update the lulo kimberlite drilling program by identifying other possible nonmagnetic kimberlites through identifying new anomalies with em conductive signatures as well as to provide further definition of known targets identified from the earlier aeromagnetic surveys   in addition the tdem survey data would also be used to locate alluvium channels that could assist in mapping new alluvial diamond deposits along the cacuilo river   as announced to the asx on  may  preliminary analysis of the tdem data resulted in the discovery of the coarse nearsurface l kimberlite located km upstream of mining block    core from l was included in the first batch of kimberlite drill core samples dispatched during the quarter for laboratory analysis in cape town south africa this batch also included coarse kimberlite core samples from l l l l l and l   the laboratory analysis process involves crushing the drill core and extracting kimberlite indicator minerals including garnet ilmenite chrome spinel chrome diopside and zircon from heavy liquid concentrates these indicator minerals are then analysed using an electron microprobe to determine their mineral chemistry   the mineral chemistry results are used to prioritise kimberlites for follow up work including further drilling and bulk sampling the first results from the kimberlite samples currently undergoing laboratory analysis in cape town are expected in the september  quarter         mothae kimberlite project lesotho   during the previous quarter lucapa acquired a  interest in the advanced highvalue mothae kimberlite project this followed an international tender process run by the government of the kingdom of lesotho who has retained a  interest   mothae is considered complementary to lulo in that both resources are known to host large and premiumvalue diamonds a sector of the diamond industry that has seen pricing remain robust mothae is located at the heart of the highestprice cluster of kimberlite mines in the world and within km of londonlisted gem diamonds letseng mine the worlds highest  per carat kimberlite diamond mine   lucapa notes the recent announcement by gem diamonds on july  of the recovery of a  carat dcolour type iia gem from letseng which closely followed two  carat diamond recoveries in june    the highvalue nature of the mothae resource is also reflected in the independent jorc resource estimate of more than  million carats of diamonds at a modelled average diamond value of us per carat at a mm bottom cutoff size  this is the second highest average price per carat of any kimberlite resource in the world while the jorc classified resource has been estimated to a depth of m independent modelling of the mothae kimberlite pipe extends to m see asx announcement  march    under the phase  development plan lucapa plans to process  million tonnes of mainly weathered nearsurface kimberlite material at  tonnes per annum over the first three years this material is primarily freedig which means it will require limited drilling and blasting  lucapa will commence detailed studies for the phase  development plan for mothae once phase  is fully commissioned   lucapa is able to fasttrack mine development at mothae because the  hectare kimberlite pipe has already been well defined through drilling and trial mining the trial mining produced more than  carats of diamonds which included individual stones of up to  carats and type iia gems these diamonds were sold for usm with individual stones achieving prices of up to us per carat   in developing mothae within the next  months lucapa will also leverage off the significant operating experience its board and management team have in lesotho including at the neighbouring letseng and kao mines      the company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the original market announcement and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the mothae resource estimate in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed  the company confirms that the form and context in which the competent persons findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market announcement during the quarter lucapa undertook multiple work streams to advance its phase  development plan for mothae these included ·     optimising mine planning and plant throughput modelling ·     updating the financial and production modelling to determine optimisation impact on project economics ·     environmental audit and approval applications ·     commenced the tendering process for large contracts and contractors ·     development infrastructure planning including plant slimes and fresh water dam locations ·     commencement of earth works and upgrading of accommodation units ·     strengthening the technical management team   orapa area f botswana   lucapas orapa area f project is located km east of the prolific orapa diamond mine in botswana previous exploration work carried out by lucapa was successful in defining a doublelobed coincident gravitymagnetic feature at the an anomaly measuring approximately m x m   during the quarter lucapa commenced the environmental approval process to drill an a drilling contract is being finalised with drilling of the an anomaly expected to commence during the current september  quarter   brooking diamond project western australia   lucapas brooking diamond project is located within km of the ellendale diamond field in western australias kimberley district which was formerly the worlds leading producer of rare fancy yellow diamonds   previous exploration work carried out by lucapa identified a series of welldefined conductors at brooking potentially associated with lamproite a host rock for diamonds   during the quarter lucapa commenced planning for a heritage survey over the areas at brooking where drilling is planned this survey is expected to be completed soon enabling drilling to commence later in the september  quarter   corporate   lucapa cash balance   at  june  lucapa held cash reserves of usm am in addition lulo mining company sml lucapa  owner and operator held cash of us million at  june    lucapas cash balance included usm in lulo loan repayments repatriated from angola during the quarter  the repatriation process for the final usm portion of the loan repayment due to lucapa is expected to be completed this quarter   lucapas usm cash balance does not include the usm distribution paid to the company in the previous quarter see asx announcement  march  as previously advised lucapa will repatriate its capital loan repayments from lulo mining company sml but will set aside and leave in angola its  share of the alluvial distributions declared to the sml partners to fund the ongoing lulo kimberlite exploration program   during the quarter lucapa received usm in proceeds from the conversion of  unlisted a options by directors and management the remaining unlisted a options expired on  april  and       may    mothae funding package   on  may  lucapa announced a funding package of up to usm am to fund

the usm consideration for mothae lucapa originally scheduled to make the second usm payment to the government of lesotho during the quarter however in agreement with the government this payment was deferred until after the countrys national general elections which were held in early june    with the elections now concluded the new government and new ministers sworn in the government of lesotho and lucapa are meeting in lesotho shortly to conclude the payment formalities lucapa will pay the government of lesotho the usm second payment in july  and commence the monthly payments of us over the following eight months to complete the us million consideration   aim listing   in  lucapa appointed london firm panmure gordon  co as its uk advisers as part of plans to consider a dual listing on londons aim market   lucapa continues to visit london to present to uk institutional investors and funds to promote lucapa and outline the companys development plans for lulo and the highvalue mothae kimberlite   the positive feedback from these road shows has prompted lucapa to commit to plans for a dual listing on londons aim market as a result preparations for the aim listing are being advanced with lucapa shares expected to be trading on the aim market in the december  quarter   lucapa believes that the aim listing will help the company achieve its objective of attracting institutional and cornerstone investors to its share register   brooking consideration   during the quarter lucapa issued  fully paid ordinary shares and  unlisted a options expiring  may  to leopold diamond company
