email print  print  email this article to please enter your email address subject comments mark buthman graduated from the university of iowa in may of  with a degree in finance and business the next month he went to work for kimberlyclark as a cost analyst at a memphis manufacturing facility thirtythree years later he is still with the paperproducts maker the only fulltime employer he’s had but not for much longer buthman the company’s cfo since january  will step down from that role on april  and retire at yearend although he’s now one of the more senior finance chiefs among fortune  companies and his particular employer has  billion in annual revenue and  employees buthman says he never aspired to the role for much of his career he assumed he’d wind up running one of kimberlyclark’s businesses mark buthman that changed in the late s when he was vice president of strategic planning and analysis and began to see that he was on a track that could take him to the top finance seat if that was what he wanted in  tom falk then the company’s chief operating officer confided in buthman that falk would likely be kimberlyclark’s next chief executive and that when that time came he wanted buthman to be his cfo “tom is probably the smartest person i’ve ever met and he’s got a brilliant financial mind” buthman says of falk who’s still the ceo “i told him ‘tom you’re so good at finance that i’m not sure being your cfo would be much fun’ i stepped back over a weekend to think and talk to my wife about it i wanted to be at the leadership table that would set the company’s course for the future so on monday i told him that if that was the role he wanted me to play i’d be honored to do it” questioning his suitability for a role was old hat for buthman “early on in my career i was a beneficiary of leaders in our organization who always saw more potential in me than i saw in myself” he says “before i became cfo i never had a job at kimberlyclark that lasted more than two years in each climb to the next level there was an element of uncertainty some people brim with confidence and make their own path i learned along the way people saw that potential in me and that’s part of our job as leaders to make that right judgment of when someone is ready to stretch to that next climb” a significant challenge arose six years into buthman’s tenure as cfo he had been  when he took on the role leading a team whose senior members were largely in their s and s “they were very good at what they did they’d all been in their roles at kimberlyclark or elsewhere for at least  years and they were not going to let me make a mistake” he says “they were like a warm blanket” in  the company put an early retirement offer on the table and eight of those people left in the same month suddenly buthman was missing  years of leadership experience “we had robust succession plans for every one of them and we had started to build capabilities behind them but i didn’t think it was all going to happen at once” he says “i was really nervous it turned out to be an excellent learning experience though buthman was overwhelmed by a surge of innovation and fresh ideas put forth by the new group over the next year for example the new blood came up with a number of ideas for closing the books earlier and since  the turnaround time has shrunk from nine days to four forming a new leadership team with largely different backgrounds from the old one and reaping the benefits from the new perspectives opened his eyes buthman decided he would set their direction and “just let them go” “now we made more mistakes at first” he says “but it was a way to unlock our potential and make my impact much bigger i was involved in important things that i really had to have my heart and soul in but there are many important decisions that have to be made in a finance organization every day that are much better made by for example our treasurer our head of tax or the cfo of our consumer division instead of having my hands in the mix” in fact the need to make fewer decisions is a hallmark of a modern cfo according to buthman when he started out back in the s he says all information flowed uphill in an organization so those at the top added value by making key strategic decisions “today i actually make relatively few decisions because information is now disseminated so widely my job now is to set direction set boundaries help set culture and try to put the people closest to a problem in a position to make good decisions” the idea that new leadership brings fresh ideas is actually one of the reasons behind buthman’s plan to retire “i am now one of those people who have been in a role for a long time” he says “the organization kind of adapts to you succession planning is not just about individual people it’s about the whole ecosystem fresh eyes on old problems create innovation i’m at a point where after  years in the cfo role all my best ideas have been tried i didn’t want to be the guy who stayed a year or two too long i have a certain way of leading and maria henry who will take the finance reins from buthman will have a different way” he gives some other reasons for his impending departure he’s accomplished most of what he set out to accomplish for one he also wants to “exercise his leadership muscles” outside of kimberlyclark perhaps as a member of boards and as a mentor to young finance professionals “i have an idea that new cfos may not have enough support to get them jumpstarted and there may be an opportunity to help them either as a cfo or a coach” he says otherwise buthman still young at  says he doesn’t yet know what else his future may hold one thing he won’t do he says is take another cfo job asked to name the highlight of his career buthman says that from a company standpoint there was no one event that stood out he points instead to the three ceos he’s worked under each of which pushed kimberlyclark in a new direction the first darwin smith in the s took it from a pulpandpaper operation managing millions of acres of timberland around the world to a consumerproducts company the second wayne sanders pushed for a change in portfolio composition in the s when buthman as a point person on a series of acquisitions and divestitures helped to again reshape the company that effort created the international business that is now its growth driver falk’s tenure has been about shaping the organization’s execution focus putting together a deeper leadership team and improving its marketing brandbuilding and strategicthinking capabilities from a personal standpoint buthman says he’s proudest of having had an impact on people since he’s been at the company for such a long time he’s gotten “hundreds” of notes since announcing his retirement plan “not one of them highlighted a business decision i made or a compelling speech or anything else businessoriented” he says “they were all about little ways i had an effect on them you don’t think about that as you’re going through the journey but to me the ability to inspire people is very fulfilling” how do you feel on the inside buthman is asked about leaving the company after so many years he doesn’t appear to be overly sentimental “people come and go” he says “it doesn’t mean your personal relationships with them change i’ve had a long run so i’m anxious to try some other things to push myself and grow i’m ready for a change” leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name  email

google print driving individual innovation mark buthman cfo kimberlyclark mark buthman mark buthman svp and cfo of kimberlyclark corporation since  is known for establishing the “power of a cfo” a mindset to motivate his finance organization of  people to offer ideas and challenge the status quo in addition to overseeing a global finance organization spanning  countries he is responsible for kimberlyclark’s real estate investor relations information technology it and procurement teams mr buthman who has announced he will be retiring at the end of the year discusses why it’s important to push not only his finance team but also it sales marketing and others to bring more value—to themselves as well as to the company q how does the “power of a cfo” work in practice in a finance organization that is so large and dispersed across different geographies mark buthman “the power of a cfo” is more about a mindset behaviors and thinking like a cfo rather than specific skills i often say that in finance our job is to bring an independent economic mindset to difficult business problems so in keeping with “the power of a cfo” this is a mindset that i want the  people in my finance organization to take the three ideas at the core of the “power of a cfo” are inspire drive and transform the simple construct of inspire drive and transform is based on my own personal objectives all the results i’m responsible for whether it’s interest expense cash flow business unit performance that’s under what i can drive and that cascades to my finance deputies i’m very much a believer that if you can get your top  leaders modeling desired behavior others will look to them and emulate them i expect everyone on my team to inspire the people around them to drive business results to improve their performance and transform their capabilities every day every single person in my organization has those three categories of objectives although they’re not strictly prescribed i want all of our employees to come to work every day trying to do things just a little bit better and to never be satisfied with the status quo in a sense it’s about individual innovation to put the program into action we encourage everyone in the finance organization to send us their ideas for improvement my leadership team provides feedback and we communicate the ideas out through various channels including videos blogs and facetoface meetings we also have an awards program to recognize achievement with an award given for each of the behaviors we’re trying to drive for example a new employee based in costa rica attended a kickoff meeting on the “power of a cfo” and followed up with an idea that later would save the company millions of dollars the program comes down to sharing great ideas especially across functional boundaries and geographies to make things better q you also train your finance staff in risktaking skills why and how are you doing that mark buthman a few years ago we conducted an engagement survey and found that our finance people did not feel empowered to take risks in fact they believed they were encouraged to avoid risk that bothered me because i knew that without the right approach to risktaking we could be held back in creating value i discussed the findings with our head of risk management and a few months later he came back with ideas for a smart risktaking and decisionmaking program to date we’ve trained  people in smart risktaking and it has become part of our core leadership behavior of decision making talk about someone who embodies “the power of a cfo” this person wasn’t operating from an assignment but rather from his own initiative q what guidance can you offer cfos looking to develop their finance teams mark buthman i think you need to articulate what your expectations are that’s the real value of the three categories of inspire drive and transform—to make it easier for others to understand my priorities setting clear expectations with your team and your customers is important and often that can involve changing the mindset of teams and recalibrating what’s expected within the business you also have to provide tools and development programs to reach everybody especially in a large organization such as an online university with hundreds of resources we provide a lot of inperson training including problemsolving for example with our top talent we do a simulation in which a cfo and a ceo come into the room and pressure test their conclusions we also offer rotations to provide people experiences within different parts of the organization when possible we provide our finance team experience outside of finance which can really stretch their leadership capabilities q is “the power of a cfo” and your other talent development programs used outside of finance mark buthman yes in part as the concepts apply universally i have talked with our sales marketing analytics and digital teams as well as our it and procurement organizations to me this can apply to anyone it’s about thinking like an aspirational leader and unlocking the potential of each person in the organization to deliver their best in a way that they can figure out of course not everyone wants to take this approach so that is the challenge my response is “it’s not just to make your life easier it’s to have a bigger impact” a big part of the challenge is figuring out how to bring changes to the wider organization so others can understand and strive for something they never had before q since the it function reports to you how do you see finance benefiting from a closer alignment to it mark buthman there’s a wealth of information out there and it is a big untapped opportunity for us the connection linking it finance and marketing is going to get closer and closer our challenge is how to connect data from across the company in a way that drives insights so it’s about figuring out how to use the data and apply individual logic to it we have a project called “true north” which uses statistical methods to understand correlations which translate into predictive analytics and to help predict actions for business decisions that are being made for example “if i do this trade promotion what will the result be or if i run this marketing campaign what will the result be” my dream is to have the right information to make the right decisions on the desktop of every decisionmaker around the world right at the time they need to make the decision it’s very possible but it’s also a very complicated problem to solve there’s no information we need to make a decision that can’t be delivered to the desktop it’s all available to us editor’s note this article is part of an ongoing series of interviews

customization capabilities and other means online shopping to set holiday record survey with the holiday shopping season in full swing the internet is widening its lead as consumers’ most preferred shopping destination and an increasingly “digital mindset” is influencing how giftgivers research and make purchases these are just some of the findings from deloitte’s st annual holiday survey of consumer spending intentions and trends the internet is not only having an impact on where people shop and how much they spend but on how they shop according to the survey deloitte’s  holiday survey consumers upbeat amid retail disruption consumers anticipate spending  more on holiday items in  and many intend to spend more than or the same as last year according to deloitte’s  annual holiday survey the expected uptick which is occurring despite flat income growth is attributed by deloitte economists to an improving labor market increasing home values and lower gas prices the survey also found that concerns about personal data protection persist nevertheless over half of those surveyed indicate they will continue to patronize retailers that have experienced a data breach views  analysis four ways cfos can avoid a digital talent crunch technology is redefining how work gets done both in the back office and in frontline operations while the rapid growth of digital technologies creates new opportunities for finance it also creates the potential for a digital divide if members of the finance team lack the necessary skillsets and business acumen they may not be able to make the most of these new digital capabilities learn how cfos can help their organization advance its digital efforts by focusing on leadership culture skills development and engagement keeping finance talent relevant to changing needs charles holley cfoinresidence it’s no secret that talent is key to a cfo’s success yet talent is a perennial top challenge for cfos that’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team says charles holley an independent senior advisor to deloitte drawing on his extensive leadership experiences he explains how to identify recruit and develop the people best suited for the fastchanging demands of finance the key he says is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business fpa why talent counts and what cfos can do to improve it to elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s fpa team can make cfos should focus on developing the team’s technical professional and leadership competencies specifically they can use a fourpart model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decisionmakers and the expectation that fpa will function more strategically rotating talent from fpa into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make this function integral to the organization’s success editors choice leading business transformation at the speed of tech kelly kramer

finance  pacesetters share this post mark buthmanchief financial officer kimberlyclark corporation kimberlyclark has a great tradition of innovation it pioneered five of the eight consumer product categories where it does business including facial tissues training and youth pants and bathroom tissue now the company is under pressure to innovate in the way it does business too as it drives an ambitious international expansion mark buthman who has been chief financial officer for more than  years sees the cfo as a facilitator and framer of issues someone who can help the company expand rapidly even while improving its profitability here he explains how the role of cfo at kimberlyclark is changing what are the primary opportunities and challenges that face kimberlyclark the biggest driver of our business is international growth as per capita incomes grow around the world our categories are among the first that consumers enter for the first time or where they aspire to better performance better brands at the same time as the economy has become more difficult in developed markets we need to provide differentiation and clear value in terms of the performance and the perception of our products people are nervous about spending our products have to be demonstrably better than the alternatives so we have to have great product innovation and great product performance and we have to communicate that performance effectively all over the world in the emerging markets are you designing new business models and changing pricing to grow rapidly the key for us is balancing the global approach—scalable ideas and model—with the local market and local consumer keeping that balance is a challenge because you want to drive scale but in local markets there are different demand dynamics that you have to respond to for instance in china with disposable diapers there are clear expectations in terms of fit and leakage protection and yet they don’t want to change their babies as often as folks in the united states do with huggies we have to figure out how to deliver to those expectations at a price point the parents in china can afford we’ve had to find a way to manufacture and to provide the same functional benefit at a lower cost how did the cfo function play a role in that we partnered with the businesses to design a new product development procurement manufacturing and marketing model in china first we framed the problem that needed to be solved then we used information and analytics to provide some options what about in the developed markets what role are you playing there in every one of our categories we have to be competitive on price and have the best performing product that’s a universal truth in a big box store where you have our products side by side with another premium product we have to price very competitively or the consumer may switch so the role we play is in working with all the parts of our company—supply chain product development manufacturing— to create a cost structure that will support sustainable investment and make the product successful we bring the various stakeholders together we’re at the table when every key strategic decision is made we bring an independent economic perspective to the decision you have been cfo for more than  years how is the role changing some things are the same we don’t have unlimited resources so the cfo has to be the champion of resource allocation next we help with setting goals and targets that balance investments we take into consideration the degree of difficulty in getting something done risks and prospects for growth profitability and returns on capital then we hold teams accountable for their business results what’s changing though is the role of information technology in business earlier the cfo had access to all the information aggregated it and used it when making decisions now thanks to the internet and other technologies people throughout the organization have great access to information in the old days my job was directing and deciding now i should be facilitating orchestrating and influencing rather than mandating my expectation for my team and myself is that we develop a compelling business case and champion the change this way we’re working to drive change that is embraced we’re not so much pushing as the organization is pulling how do you help drive agility within the business the competitive environment has accelerated so much that we’ve got to be much more nimble much more agile much more wired in in the planning process there are much shorter lead times to project what the business is going to do at kimberlyclark we talk a lot about taking smart risks in a lot of companies the finance role is being a policeman but here we’re more of a teacher a leader a facilitator if our role is just to say no any time there’s a risk on the table we’ re not going to create much value for our shareholders our job is to help frame issues and get the organization to take smart calculated risks will you provide an example where you played the facilitator and framer role in an effort that let to a new revenue opportunity one area where we have done that is in the international expansion we have helped the company size up the emerging markets opportunities and figure out how to successfully compete in them now about half of our total capital spend is on building capacity and innovation in  for the first time we spent more capital in developing markets than in developed markets the shift in our capital allocation didn’t mirror the growth of business in these newer markets it led the transformation of the business that was a shift that my team led at the same time we have dramatically increased marketing in developing markets—to establish our brands there we have done that while increasing our gross margins that’s possible because of the cost improvements we’re making what is technology’s role in making the company more efficient innovative and competitive the internet and transparency of consumer information and competitive cost information is changing the way the whole world works your ability to sustain a pricing advantage in an internetdriven world is about a nanosecond so we’re joined at the hip with the cio jennifer sepull in fact she reports to me our goal is to provide information so business leaders can make better faster and higher quality decisions my vision for our organization is to have the right information on the desktop for all of our decision makers so they can make a quality decision when they need to make it we’re not there yet the cio and the cfo can partner to bring that reality to life we need mobile and collaboration technologies to drive team engagement across functional and geographic boundaries if i can use technology to get information more rapidly across our organization it gives us the opportunity to unlock the best ideas technology also improves our ability to do things better we can compare our performance against benchmarks and we can share our problemsolving experiences i don’t have to wrestle with an issue by myself i can find somebody else who has dealt with the same issue already and learn from him or her the connections that technology provides are invaluable how has your relationship with the it function changed over the years in the old days the cfo was the gatekeeper of the money the cio had to come and ask for money like everybody else now it’s more a conversation about how we invest in it as a core capability we’re helping control costs by adopting standard technologies and standard ways of handling data across the organization and by eliminating redundant systems once you’ve done that you can free up resources to spend on new capabilities on innovation so the most important role for the cfo is framing issues that create new opportunities enthusiasm and energy throughout the company related reading new thinking hone your powers of persuasion finance is leading transformation and growth it’s time to put mobile first the consumability of data is as important as the data itself be global

retired cfo mark buthman mark buthman spent  years at kimberlyclark working his way up from a cost analyst to cfo and serving in several nonfinance posts along the way having retired at the end of  he now sits on the boards of forprofit and nonprofit organizations and serves on the financial executives advisory group for deloitte’s cfo program mr buthman discusses what his year term as cfo taught him the steps he took to develop finance employees to their full potential and how he helps to guide current and aspiring cfos in this conversation with sanford sandy cockrell iii us national managing partner cfo program deloitte llp mr buthman also talks about the relationship between the board and the cfo and what boards expect of cfos sanford cockrell iii sandy cockrell you spent your entire career at kimberlyclark but not always in finance what were the key milestones in reaching the cfo position mark buthman i always wanted to drive business results to lead teams and to coach influence and develop people those were more important motivators for me than becoming cfo in fact i think the nonfinance roles i took on were the most important because they forced me to lead without relying on my financial skills and experiences running a tissue plant for example was a fantastic leadership opportunity because i literally brought nothing to the table other than perhaps the ability to do the budget everything else was about getting the team to where it needed to go at one point i was also asked to support some ma transactions but i didn’t have extensive training in it at the time those projects came with a lot of responsibility and forced me to learn skills and a new nomenclature very rapidly they really tested my learning agility and i’m grateful that i had the opportunity to stretch myself in a new space sandy cockrell you believe in the value of measuring and improving employee engagement how have you seen such efforts translate into results mark buthman i think a highly engaged workforce correlates to improved bottomline performance about halfway into my tenure as cfo we did an engagement survey that showed that some people in my finance organization didn’t feel like they were empowered to take risks they felt like they were more encouraged to cut costs and avoid risks than to drive growth in the business that frustrated me because business is about taking calculated risks and to me the finance organization is the ideal resource to be able to help the business determine riskreward tradeoffs i shared my concern with the head of risk management at the time and he worked with someone from our legal team to put together a program called “smart risktaking” within about  months the program trained  people both within and outside finance “smart risktaking” ultimately became an element of one of the core behaviors we expected from anyone in a leadership role sandy cockrell you also have advocated for pushing decisionmaking down in the organization what is the benefit of doing that mark buthman the role of a finance leader is to drive business performance and much of that depends on empowering the organization to make smart decisions strategically tactically and operationally there are times when you have to take the decision or draw a bright line that can’t be crossed but i think leaders are most effective when they take on the roles of coach teacher and influencer so their teams make the calls and own the results prior to the digital revolution the role of the cfo was to accumulate information from different silos bring it together and make decisions at the top of the organization there was really no other way to do it today most of the information needed to make decisions—even big strategic decisions—is readily available to many people in the organization which gives the cfo a golden opportunity to push decisionmaking down and empower teams to do that one has to be good at articulating a clear vision and giving people a framework one colleague described it as “the freedom of boundaries” meaning that he understood his latitude to make decisions as long as he knew what lines couldn’t be crossed as the cfo when you empower teams this way it can free you up to have much greater influence on the business  if every decision needs to come to your desk that’s going to slow decision making and limit your impact sandy cockrell you have significant experience as a board director what has it taught you about the relationship between the board and the cfo mark buthman serving on boards has exposed me to a diverse range of business strategies and leadership styles and has given me an appreciation for the importance of looking at a business from the outside in as a cfo my experience as a board member helped me understand how to communicate to the board the essential things they need to know while keeping the discussions at a high level until i sat on the other side of those conversations as a director i didn’t fully realize the importance of communications from a board member’s perspective i stress to sitting cfos that working with the audit committee in particular can provide them with an opportunity to highlight talent in the finance organization that helps foster more trust within the audit committee that the right people are in the right roles and they are going to do the right thing board members can actually help cfos develop their talent because they bring an objective perspective free of the daytoday relationships with people i’ve also learned that what boards want to see most in a cfo is someone with a strong functional and ethical foundation a strategic mindset and the ability to attract and build exceptional talent with strong communication and influencing skills and of course cfos need to understand when and how to alert the board to an emerging issue having served in both roles i encourage cfos to view the board as a resource and to make the effort to reach out to an individual board member if their skills can help address a particular issue including talent matters sandy cockrell you spend some of your time coaching other cfos what do you encourage them to focus on mark buthman i tell new cfos that they now have broader responsibilities than they’ve ever had before yet they have only half the time to meet them all that’s because more of their time is committed to board meetings investor calls and roadshows earnings forecast reviews ceo leadership meetings travel and other activities their calendar may be booked a full year out or more so as cfo the ability to manage your time effectively and to invest it where it makes the most difference is something you have to get your arms around one technique that helped me—even although it goes against conventional teaching—was to drop most of my oneonone meetings we made exceptions for cases where someone needed coaching help in setting direction or problemsolving or needed to communicate an emerging issue i also encourage the cfos i work with to help their teams identify and act on their purpose and values as much or more than the work they do  for example when i became cfo i had a game plan to improve our core finance capabilities set a clear tone at the top have a robust set of internal controls and address talent development typical expectations for many finance organizations i refer to those as the “what” despite all the work being done however i had the sense that our finance organization including myself was still not reaching its full potential eventually i realized it was because we had not addressed the “why”  so together we rallied around a very simple message to empower our leaders to think like a cfo with a mission to drive business results inspire our teams and each other and transform the way we did our work  if everyone in an organization feels empowered to focus on those three things good outcomes can happen  at the end of the day if an organization is  right and  aligned that is a terrific result and much better than being  right and only  aligned editor’s note this article is part of an ongoing series of interviews with ceos

finance needs red yellow green building a strong team during a transition firsttime or newly hired cfos need to make critical decisions early on about who to place in top positions or risk being saddled with an underperforming team that can hamper the cfo’s ability to meet their strategic goals dr ajit kambil global research director for deloitte’s cfo program and creator of its executive transition lab explains why so much depends on the talent decisions cfos make in their first  days and describes techniques for effectively evaluating and developing finance staffers assessing risk in incentive compensation plans incentive compensation plans can align employee behaviors with a company’s objectives but there have been examples of such programs resulting in unintended consequences that have damaged reputations and financially harmed companies and shareholders learn why finance leaders should consider whether there is a process in place to identify and mitigate several potential risks of incentive compensation plans including financial reputational operational and employeeretention risks views  analysis four ways cfos can avoid a digital talent crunch technology is redefining how work gets done both in the back office and in frontline operations while the rapid growth of digital technologies creates new opportunities for finance it also creates the potential for a digital divide if members of the finance team lack the necessary skillsets and business acumen they may not be able to make the most of these new digital capabilities learn how cfos can help their organization advance its digital efforts by focusing on leadership culture skills development and engagement keeping finance talent relevant to changing needs charles holley cfoinresidence it’s no secret that talent is key to a cfo’s success yet talent is a perennial top challenge for cfos that’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team says charles holley an independent senior advisor to deloitte drawing on his extensive leadership experiences he explains how to identify recruit and develop the people best suited for the fastchanging demands of finance the key he says is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business fpa why talent counts and what cfos can do to improve it to elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s fpa team can make cfos should focus on developing the team’s technical professional and leadership competencies specifically they can use a fourpart model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decisionmakers and the expectation that fpa will function more strategically rotating talent from fpa into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make
