growth at reasonable price contrarian longterm horizonsummarywe evaluate csxs performance ratios against prior harrison railroads canadian national and canadian pacific csx has significant room for improvement however the current valuation fully reflects operating improvements relative to the operating performance and valuations of legacy harrison railroads csx nyse csx has experienced a quick rise in its share price since the announcement that e hunter harrison would be joining the company the increase is largely based on expectations for improved financial performance through the implementation of precision scheduled railroading nysearcapsr pioneered by harrison during his stents at the illinois center railroad canadian national railway nyse cni and canadian pacific railway nyse cp we decided to look into the various financial ratios of these companies to determine how they compare and develop a projection of csxs potential results and corresponding valuation assuming implementation of psr drove csxs operating ratios to those currently experienced by the firms previously led by harrison we note that for this analysis we chose to compare the ratio performance of csx with the performance of cp and cni rather than norfolk southern nyse nsc or union pacific nyse unp for the simple reason that it provides a direct comparison with firms previously led by harrison and which have implemented under his guidance the psr principles comparison ratios we began by compiling the basic financial statement information for each railroad for the most recent annual period  and calculating a selection of relevant business performance and valuation ratios we incorporated a few adjustments to normalize certain items such as eliminating the debt repurchase expense for csx during the period and the impact of additional pension contributions on cash flows for csx and cni the summary information is presented in the following chart source annual reports of csx cp and cni csx clearly underperforms the firms previously led by harrison in some cases by large margins csxs operating ratio is significantly less than either company as are income ratios with respect to revenue and return ratios with respect to assets equity and cash flow clearly there is room for improvement in csxs financial performance in reviewing the initial ratio values as well as the scale of the companies we determined that it would be most appropriate to develop a projected income statement for csx based on the operating ratios of cni in addition to being more similar in scale in terms of revenues assets and equity cni also had the lowest operating ratio of the group and its use would result in the most optimistic comparison we therefore set csxs operating ratio for our initial projection equal to that for cni and recalculated the income statement based on this ratio in essence this approach reduces the companys operating expenses in the model and therefore increases operating income but the effect is the same regardless of the exact combination of benefits whether increased revenues or reduced expenses in effect for this projection we dont need to estimate the exact revenue and expense impacts since the operating margin effectively takes all these factors above the line into account additionally we assumed that csxs debt structure was the same ie interest expense was unchanged and the same tax rate would be applicable the resulting projections are as follows source proprietary projections we project that if csx had performed on par with cni in  the company would have earned  per share versus  after eliminating the debt repurchase expense this represents a significant performance gain however in terms of return on assets and equity csx would still have underperformed cni largely due to the substantially higher taxes applicable in the united states approximately  for csx versus approximately  for cni valuation estimates we used these values to estimate the valuation per share of csx assuming the full realization of the improvement in operating ratio based on the current valuations of cp and cni using ebitda multiples and pricetoearnings ratios the valuation estimates based on these ratios are as follows the range of share values for csx utilizing cnis top tier operating margin and the current valuations for both cni and cp was  per share in comparison to csxs current share price of  csx appears fully valued of not slightly overvalued in comparison to its key harrison psr peers using an assumption that the company can achieve maximum performance results csxs per share valuation would be higher than this range if we instead utilized current valuation ratios for peers norfolk southern and union pacific however we believe this would be inappropriate for three reasons · we believe the valuations of nsc and to a lesser extent unp also incorporate harrison premiums of their own with the expectation that improvements at csx will inevitably drive competing performance improvements at nsc and unp in which case using their multiples would essentially double count the harrison premium · we believe railroad valuations are already at relatively high levels especially with pricetoearnings ratios pushing  and expectations of per share earnings growth ranging from  per year over the next few years · we believe cni and cp are the most appropriate comparable companies since these are both companies that harrison directly led at which he implemented his specific form of psr and subsequent left which will eventually happen at csx in addition adjustments in the assumptions and ratios would impact the respective share prices however given that cnis operating ratio is highly competitive only significant assumption adjustments which we believe are generally unlikely would result in material changes in the valuation range we therefore believe that csx shares are currently fully valued or slightly overvalued and reflect substantially all of the potential for performance gains from the implementation of psr in addition it is not certain that the full implementation of psr at csx would result in equivalent operating performance csx has not operated in a vacuum since the introduction of psr so the harrison implementation of psr may not result in operating improvement gains as significant as those experienced by cni and cp indeed cps operating ratio only five years ago was significantly higher than the current operating ratio of csx suggesting the company started in a worse position and had much more initial opportunity for improvement in addition factors such as differing cargo mixes between the railroads and the relative profitability of various types of cargo will impact the ultimate outcome summary we believe that csx is fully valued or slightly overvalued at the current price and already reflects substantially all of the potential improvements from the implementation of psr we recognize that the shares may continue to receive a boost from the initial stages of psr implementation and the associated financial performance improvements but as value investors we find relatively little margin for error in the current valuation we therefore recommend reducing current positions in favor of other investment opportunities disclosure i amwe are long

back notorious railman hunter harrison is making news nowadays as the selfproclaimed saviour of the great canadian pacific railway  the man that wall street loves may soon become the villain to many canadians  few recall that  started with hunter harrisons former employer  harrison was the ceo of canadian national railway a few years back – yanking harrisons juicy pension for various breaches of a nondisclosure commitments  hunter harrison started the year by coming out of retirement and announcing to all that he was prepared to get into an alley fight with cn  hunter harrison is fyouth’s villain of  because he is more than simply a mean and dangerous man that is hellbent on cutting labour and pension expenses at canadian pacific  hunter personifies corporate evils  a corporate elite more interested in his individualistic pursuit of power and fame than the business titan to lead a team or an organization to international dominance hunter harrison has built a reputation on squashing workers’ rights disregarding environmental obligations and changing the culture of an historic railway away from its concerns with safety and environmental protections to a myopic focus on profitmaximization  hunter harrison became the main guy at canadian national when cn bought illinois central to become one of the largest railway companies in the world  the canadian national railway company was wholly owned by the government of canada for the first  years or so of the companys existence  in  canadian national employed about  people in canada and the company’s operating losses were paid by canadian taxpayers the privatization of canadian national in  was followed by increased foreign ownership and a name change to cn the end result was that americans owned over  of cn stock within a few years after privatization when cn purchased illinois central a major american railroad company based out of chicago e hunter harrison the president and ceo of illinois central took over the reins of cnin  hunter harrison announced that he wanted to fire a bunch of employees to increase shareholder value of cn  hunter harrison and his new management team axed the jobs of safety supervisors environmental compliance officers and other tenured management personnel cns stock price rose after the mass firings so hunter kept announcing more and more layoffs  by  the number of cn employees had declined to  even though the merged rail company had become one of the largest in the world and was moving more freight and handling more contaminants than ever before under the hunter cn abandoned unprofitable rail lines in northern and remote regions of canada and ignored safety obligations resulting in numerous deaths and injuries to workers hunter shrugged while cn left a legacy of environmental contamination throughout the canadian wilderness ranging from contamination of pristine aboriginal lands in alberta to the abandonment of a pcb facility in north bay ontario hunter harrison demonstrated a villainous disregard for environmental protection and safety obligations while he ran cnthe hunters most dastardly deeds occurred when rail workers went on strike to protest cns blatant violations of its collective bargaining agreement the hunter was not concerned with whether the strike by the workers was legal or not he simply wanted to destroy the union so he sent scab workers from the united states to fill in for the striking canadian workers with the bravado of a railway legend hunter held amazing sway over canadian and us politicians  hunter believed that the nafta provision prohibiting a multinational company from transferring workers from one country to another was another example of big government protecting the little people  governments sat back and did nothing when hunter harrison illegally introduced scab workers into the  legal labor dispute between cn and its employees  the  strike ended but cn management continued to mistreat its employees  the unionized workers exercised their right to strike again in   this time the hunter charmed the politicos and voila canadas federal government passed backtowork legislation  although special legislation forcing unionized employees back to work is extremely rare for a private company in canada the harper government of the time defended its backtowork legislation as a special gift to cn  the above photo of hunter harrison was taken from a press conference where reporters questioned him about the hunters approach to workers rightsnice and subtle flick of the finger by the hunter to the workers and reporters  well tables are now turned and fyouth is pleased to give a finger salute to hunter harrison hunter harrison has the inside dope on cn and he wants to make money from the info  now canadian pacific – an archrival of cn for more than  years  wants to pay the hunter big money to find out where all of the bodies are buried  cn probably thought that they could stop the hunter by slashing his valuable pensions but this guy is a total sleaze  the hunter responded with a major stock market play that will dearly enrich his pocketbook at the expense of all those that misjudge the hunters character  hunter harrison is now running the show at cp rail and he has not changed one bit  the mainstream media will not tell you that hunter harrison plans to destroy the spirit and the pocketbooks of cp workers but fyouth is pleased to declare hunter harrison the villain of  editorfyouthcom  reply to hunter harrison continues to be villain of the year

canadian national railway  pm  updated ottawa — the canadian national railway publicly cautioned its former chief executive e hunter harrison on friday against participating in the hedge fund manager william a ackman’s plan to put him in charge of running the canadian pacific railway saying that would violate his employment contract mr harrison is widely credited with turning canadian national into one of north america’s most costefficient railways but the directors of canadian pacific have rejected mr ackman’s proposal to have him lead a similar transformation at that railroad which lags behind canadian national in efficiency earlier this week mr ackman whose firm pershing square capital management is the largest shareholder in canadian pacific said he was planning a proxy battle to replace the company’s board in order to make mr harrison the railroad’s chief executive canadian national however does not appear interested in seeing mr harrison improve the fortunes of its rival “as part of his employment contract with cn mr harrison agreed upon retirement as president and chief executive officer on dec   to be bound by a broad range of confidentiality and multiyear noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions” canadian national said in an email statement “cn has asked mr harrison to respect his commitments to cn and to reconsider his expressed interest in a position at canadian pacific” the montrealbased railroad said “cn has also put william a ackman of pershing square capital management lp on notice to cease any efforts to induce breaches of mr harrison’s contractual obligations to cn” mr harrison’s blanket noncompete agreement with canadian national expired at the end of  but canadian national said in an earlier statement that his

canadian national mr ackman acknowledged that if he was successful in changing chief executives mr harrison would lose his canadian national pension and require compensation from canadian pacific but he characterized the cost of that arrangement as “not material” to canadian pacific he also said friday that canadian national’s warning was an endorsement of mr harrison’s skills “this confirms to me

mentioned how the up has had a steam program for  years and the ns had one until bob claytor retired and passed away hunter cut in and said to me right away and bob claytor managed to turn over a steam engine while he was there hunter doesnt miss a thing i should have known he would have known about that accident many years ago although i dont think it had anything to do with the steam engine he was driving he then said i hate steam engines the audience chuckled when he said that they are expensive to run the liability is too high and they serve no useful purpose he never did touch on the rcp he did say he will continue to run the christmas train he then said the company contributed over a million dollars to the relief fund in new york city after hurricane sandy and was quick to point out that the norfolk southern only donated  he seems to have an answer for everything go here for my rail shots httpwwwrailpicturesnetshowphotosphpuserid building the cpr kootenay division in n scale

geep would someone please mind filling me in on claytor derailing a steam locomotive well im pretty sure what mr harrison is referring to is the  derailment in suffolk va of a ns employee special behind nw  however the  did not roll over as harrison says but bob claytor was at the throttle that day out of the  cars the  was pulling  of them derailed when one of the passenger cars picked a switch all the car were equipped with tightlock couplers except for three of the older southern heavy weight cars two of those southern passenger cars jackknifed and that where the most severe injuries were the accident  tied up the main line for a while and caused damage to excursion equipment as well as injuring quite a few ns employes and their families after that accident the type h coupler became standard for those running excursion equipment amtrak uses the type h on all of its equipment and requires any private equipment on their train to be fitted with type h couplers along with the other amtrak standards interesting note the nw  had been in a derailment in  along the tug river in that case the locomotive did indeed roll over the icc reported that the engineer had entered the curve at to high of speed and the high center of gravity cause the locomotive to tip over i believe the engineer and fireman died in that accident but i dont think any passengers died i

from where he comes  and i disagree with your characterisation of my comment  i know people who are into whatever business they are in strictly for the money and bottom line with no feeling understanding or care for the productand often of the customers either as long as the bottom line is as black as possible they feel they have done their job  in many businesses customers have been short changed  quality and quantity of product compromised local economies eliminated and lives in ruin  but the bottom line is great and the guy is called a genius  harrison appears to be border line

with steam stand at trackside today and tell me what you see isnt at least as impressive as what was commonplace in the s steam was good in its day todays escws are every bit as impressive as the berkshires and moguls  of a bygone era the trains are bigger today the systems are more complex we are moving far more freight with far fewer people than was accomplished  or  years ago ehh has it right railroading is  above and foremost a business  running steam locomotives and excursions are an expense and get in the way of production perhaps the right answer is to have museums and fan groups come up with a rail line of their own that could be used for the express purpose of running steam locomotives and vintage rail equipment  maybe a short line could be revitalized and run with steam
