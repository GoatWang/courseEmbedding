more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation

need for the capital to start up customer loyalty when large manufacturing firms may have existing customers loyal to established products or exclusive agreements with key links in the supply chain

similar products we will be in direct competition with them many of these companies may have a greater more established customer base than us we will likely lose business to such companies also many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better price for paper bags than us which may also cause us to lose business we foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants we may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations makkanotti group

conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in form k for the fiscal period ended march   filed with the sec on june     use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues costs and expenses during the reporting period management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates   property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using principally the straightline method when items are retired or otherwise disposed of income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized thereon ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and replacements and betterments are capitalized the range of estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation for principal items of property and equipment are as follows   asset category useful life   furniture and fixtures  years   office equipment  years   computer software  years     we periodically review our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset the amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the assets estimated fair value and its book value we recorded no impairment on our longlived assets during the three months ended september   and the fiscal year ended march     revenue recognition   revenue generated from providing the sale of goods and services   revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists our goods and services have been provided all significant contractual

and method of billing and collection we do not offer a refund policy      table of contents   makkanotti group corp notes to  condensed financial statements september   unaudited   revenue from sales

rendered those revenues and costs directly associated with such revenues are deferred until such time as the product or services are provided   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with asc  “accounting for income taxes” the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized as of september   the company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions   fair value measurements   the company adopted the provisions of asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements   the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments   asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable   level  — inputs that are unobservable for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions   the company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis   loss per share   the company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with asc topic   earnings per share  basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the company during the three and six months ended september   and  there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments outstanding   recently issued standards   in january  the

defined in exchange act rule af the companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of september   using the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso   a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of september   the company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses as described below      we do not have an audit committee – while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee it is the managements view that such a committee including a financial expert member is an utmost important entity level control over the companys financial statement currently the board of directors acts in the capacity of the audit committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over managements activities      table of contents      we did not maintain appropriate cash controls – as of september   the company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions and did not require dual signature on the companys bank accounts alternatively the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the company had limited transactions in their bank accounts          we did not implement appropriate information technology controls – as at september   the company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the companys data or offsite storage of data in the event of theft misplacement or loss due to unmitigated factors   accordingly the company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls   as a result of the material weaknesses described above management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of september   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by coso   changes in internal controls over financial reporting   there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as

reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues costs and expenses during the reporting period management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using principally the straightline method when items are retired or otherwise disposed of income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized thereon ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and replacements and betterments are capitalized the range of estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation for principal items of property and equipment are as follows  asset category useful life furniture and fixtures  yearsoffice equipment  yearscomputer software  years we periodically review our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset the amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the assets estimated fair value and its book value we recorded no impairment on our longlived assets during the three months ended june   and the

obligations have been satisfied and collection is reasonably assured no guarantees or warranties are provided for the goods or services we render due to the nature of the good and services provided and method of billing and collection we do not offer a refund policy  revenue from sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the end customer and collectability is reasonable assured  if

product or services are provided income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized as of june   the company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions  fair value measurements the company adopted the provisions of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments  asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable level  — inputs that are unobservable for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions the company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis loss per share the company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with asc topic  earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the company during the three months ended june   and  there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments outstanding

disclosures about market risk none item  controls and procedures management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af the companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of june   using the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of june   the company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses as described below   we do not have an audit committee – while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee it is the managements view that such a committee including a financial expert member is an utmost important entity level control over the companys financial statement currently the board of directors acts in the capacity of the audit committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over managements activities    we did not maintain appropriate cash controls – as of june   the company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions and did not require dual signature on the companys bank accounts alternatively the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the company had limited transactions in their bank accounts    we did not implement appropriate information technology controls – as at june   the company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the companys data or offsite storage of data in the event of theft misplacement or loss due to unmitigated factors  accordingly the company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls as a result of the material weaknesses described above management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of june   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by coso  changes in internal controls over financial reporting there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june   that occurred during our first fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting this quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the companys registered public

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
