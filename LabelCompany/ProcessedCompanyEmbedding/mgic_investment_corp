carefully reviewing borrowers’ credit capacity capital and collateral the four cs we can piece together a comprehensive picture of risk the presence of a highrisk factor in any one of these categories doesn’t necessarily threaten successful homeownership but when a number of interrelated highrisk characteristics are present without sufficient offsets or compensating factors their cumulative effect dramatically increases the likelihood of default the perspective we gain from evaluating the four cs gives us insight to loan quality underwriting for quality is an acquired art — not a cutanddried
