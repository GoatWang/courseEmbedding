ballantyne scott was able to publish his first works including glenfinlas and the eve of st john and his poetry then began to bring him to public attention in  the lay of the last minstrel captured wide public imagination and his career as a writer was established in spectacular fashion he published many other poems over the next ten years including the popular the lady of the lake printed in  and set in the trossachs portions of the german translation of this work were set to music by franz schubert one of these songs ellens dritter gesang is popularly labelled as schuberts ave maria

on the south bank of the river tweed nearer melrose the farm had the nickname of clarty hole and when scott built a family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions in  scott was offered the position of poet laureate he declined due to concerns that such an appointment would be a poisoned chalice as the laureateship had fallen into disrepute due to the decline in quality of work suffered by previous title holders  as a succession of poetasters had churned out conventional and obsequious odes on royal occasions he sought advice from the duke of buccleuch who counseled him to retain his literary independence and the position went to scotts friend robert southey novelismedit a legend of montrose illustration from the  edition although scott had attained worldwide celebrity through his poetry he soon tried his hand at documenting his researches into the oral tradition of the scottish borders in prose fiction—stories and novels—at the time still considered aesthetically inferior to poetry above all to such classical genres as the epic or poetic tragedy as a mimetic vehicle for portraying historical events in an innovative and astute action he wrote and published his first novel waverley anonymously in  it was a tale of the jacobite rising of  its english protagonist edward waverley like don quixote a great reader of romances has been brought up by his tory uncle who is sympathetic to jacobitism although edwards own father is a whig the youthful waverley obtains a commission in the whig army and is posted in dundee on leave he meets his uncles friend the jacobite baron bradwardine and is attracted to the barons daughter rose on a visit to the highlands edward overstays his leave and is arrested and charged with desertion but is rescued by the highland chieftain fergus macivor and his mesmerizing sister flora whose devotion to the stuart cause as it exceeded her brothers in fanaticism excelled it also in purity through flora waverley meets bonnie prince charlie and under her influence goes over to the jacobite side and takes part in the battle of prestonpans he escapes retribution however after saving the life of a whig colonel during the battle waverley whose surname reflects his divided loyalties eventually decides to lead a peaceful life of establishment respectability under the house of hanover rather than live as a proscribed rebel he chooses to marry the beautiful rose bradwardine rather than cast his lot with the sublime flora macivor who after the failure of the  rising retires to a french convent there followed a succession of novels over the next five years each with a scottish historical setting mindful of his reputation as a poet scott maintained the anonymity he had begun with waverley publishing the novels under the name author of waverley or as tales of with no author among those familiar with his poetry his identity became an open secret but scott persisted in maintaining the façade perhaps because he thought his oldfashioned father would disapprove of his engaging in such a trivial pursuit as novel writing during this time scott became known by the nickname the wizard of the north in  he was given the honour of dining with george prince regent who wanted to meet the author of waverley edgar and lucie at mermaidens well by charles robert leslie  after sir walter scotts bride of lammermoor lucie is wearing a full plaid scotts  series tales of my landlord is sometimes considered a subset of the waverley novels and was intended to illustrate aspects of scottish regional life among the best known is the bride of lammermoor a fictionalized version of an actual incident in the history of the dalrymple family that took place in the lammermuir hills in  in the novel lucie ashton and the nobly born but now dispossessed and impoverished edgar ravenswood exchange vows but the ravenswoods and the wealthy ashtons who now own the former ravenswood lands are enemies and lucies mother forces her daughter to break her engagement to edgar and marry the wealthy sir arthur bucklaw lucie falls into a depression and on their wedding night stabs the bridegroom succumbs to insanity and dies in  french romantic painter eugène delacroix painted a portrait depicting himself as the melancholy disinherited edgar ravenswood the prolonged climactic coloratura mad scene for lucia in donizettis  bel canto opera lucia di lammermoor is based on what in the novel were just a few bland sentences tales of my landlord includes the now highly regarded novel old mortality set in – against the backdrop of the ferocious anticovenanting campaign of the tory graham of claverhouse subsequently made viscount dundee called bluidy clavers by his opponents but later dubbed bonnie dundee by scott the covenanters were presbyterians who had supported the restoration of charles ii on promises of a presbyterian settlement but he had instead reintroduced episcopalian church government with draconian penalties for presbyterian worship this led to the destitution of around  ministers who had refused to take an oath of allegiance and submit themselves to bishops and who continued to conduct worship among a remnant of their flock in caves and other remote country spots the relentless persecution of these conventicles and attempts to break them up by military force had led to open revolt the story is told from the point of view of henry morton a moderate presbyterian who is unwittingly drawn into the conflict and barely escapes summary execution in writing old mortality scott drew upon the knowledge he had acquired from his researches into ballads on the subject for the minstrelsy of the scottish border scotts background as a lawyer also informed his perspective for at the time of the novel which takes place before the act of union of  english law did not apply in scotland and afterwards scotland has continued to have its own scots law as a hybrid legal system a recent critic who is a legal as well as a literary scholar argues that old mortality not only reflects the dispute between stuarts absolute monarchy and the jurisdiction of the courts but also invokes a foundational moment in british sovereignty namely the habeas corpus act also known as the great writ passed by the english parliament in  oblique reference to the origin of habeas corpus underlies scotts next novel ivanhoe set during the era of the creation of the magna carta which political conservatives like walter scott and edmund burke regarded as rooted in immemorial british custom and precedent ivanhoe  set in thcentury england marked a move away from scotts focus on the local history of scotland based partly on humes history of england and the ballad cycle of robin hood ivanhoe was quickly translated into many languages and inspired countless imitations and theatrical adaptations ivanhoe depicts the cruel tyranny of the norman overlords norman yoke over the impoverished saxon populace of england with two of the main characters rowena and locksley robin hood representing the dispossessed saxon aristocracy when the protagonists are captured and imprisoned by a norman baron scott interrupts the story to exclaim it is grievous to think that those valiant barons to whose stand against the crown the liberties of england were indebted for their existence should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of england but to those of nature and humanity but alas fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period chapter  the institution of the magna carta which happens outside the time frame of the story is portrayed as a progressive incremental reform but also as a step towards the recovery of a lost golden age of liberty endemic to england and the english system scott puts a derisive prophecy in the mouth of the jester wamba norman saw on english oak on english neck a norman yoke norman spoon to english dish and england ruled as normans wish blithe world in england never will be more till englands rid of all the four ivanhoe ch xxvii although on the surface an entertaining escapist romance alert contemporary readers would have quickly recognised the political subtext of ivanhoe which appeared immediately after the english parliament fearful of frenchstyle revolution in the aftermath of waterloo had passed the habeas corpus suspension acts of  and  and other extremely repressive measures and when traditional english charter rights versus revolutionary human rights was a topic of discussion ivanhoe was also remarkable in its sympathetic portrayal of jewish characters rebecca considered by many critics the books real heroine does not in the end get to marry ivanhoe whom she loves but scott allows her to remain faithful to her own religion rather than having her convert to christianity likewise her father isaac of york a jewish moneylender is shown as a victim rather than a villain in ivanhoe which is one of scotts waverley novels religious and sectarian fanatics are the villains while the eponymous hero is a bystander who must weigh the evidence and decide where to take a stand scotts positive portrayal of judaism which reflects his humanity and concern for religious toleration also coincided with a contemporary movement for the emancipation of the jews in england recovery of the crown jewels baronetcy and ceremonial pageantryedit rediscovering the lost honours of scotland in  george iv landing at leith in  scotts fame grew as his explorations and interpretations of scottish history and society captured popular imagination impressed by this the prince regent the future george iv gave scott permission to conduct a search for the crown jewels honours of scotland during the years of the protectorate under cromwell the crown jewels had been hidden away but had subsequently been used to crown charles ii they were not used to crown subsequent monarchs but were regularly taken to sittings of parliament to represent the absent monarch until the act of union  thereafter the honours were stored in edinburgh castle but the large locked box in which they were stored was not opened for more than  years and stories circulated that they had been lost or removed in  scott and a small team of military men opened the box and unearthed the honours from the crown room in the depths of edinburgh castle a grateful prince regent granted scott the title of baronet and in march  he received the baronetcy in london becoming sir walter scott st baronet after georges accession to the throne the city council of edinburgh invited scott at the kings behest to stagemanage the  visit of king george iv to scotland with only three weeks for planning and execution scott created a spectacular and comprehensive pageant designed not only to impress the king but also in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised scots society he used the event to contribute to the drawing of a line under an old world that pitched his homeland into regular bouts of bloody strife he along with his production team mounted what in modern days could be termed a pr event in which the king was dressed in tartan and was greeted by his people many of whom were also dressed in similar tartan ceremonial dress this form of dress proscribed after the  rebellion against the english became one of the seminal potent and ubiquitous symbols of scottish identity in his novel kenilworth elizabeth i is welcomed to the castle of that name by means of an elaborate pageant the details of which scott was well qualified to itemize much of scotts autograph work shows an almost streamofconsciousness approach to writing he included little in the way of punctuation in his drafts leaving such details to the printers to supply he eventually acknowledged in  that he was the author of the waverley novels financial problems and deathedit sir walter scotts grave at dryburgh abbey in  a ukwide banking crisis resulted in the collapse of the ballantyne printing business of which scott was the only partner with a financial interest the companys debts of £ equivalent to £ in  caused his very public ruin rather than declare himself bankrupt or to accept any kind of financial support from his many supporters and admirers including the king himself he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and determined to write his way out of debt he kept up his prodigious output of fiction as well as producing a biography of napoleon bonaparte until  by then his health was failing but he nevertheless undertook a grand tour of europe and was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went he returned to scotland and in september  during the epidemic in scotland that year died of typhus at abbotsford the home he had designed and had built near melrose in the scottish borders his wife lady scott had died in  and was buried as an episcopalian two presbyterian ministers and one episcopalian officiated at his funeral scott died owing money but his novels continued to sell and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his death personal lifeedit scotts eldest son lt walter scott inherited his fathers estate and possessions he married jane jobson only daughter of william jobson of lochore died  and his wife rachel stuart died  on  february  scott srs lawyer from at least  was hay donaldson ws died  who was also agent to the duke of buccleuch scott was donaldsons proposer when he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh his distant cousin was the poet randall swingler abbotsfordedit abbotsford house tomb of walter scott in dryburgh abbey by henry fox talbot  when scott was a boy he sometimes travelled with his father from selkirk to melrose where some of his novels are set at a certain spot the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the battle of melrose  during the summers from  scott made his home at the large house of ashestiel on the south bank of the river tweed  miles  km north of selkirk when his lease on this property expired in  scott bought cartley hole farm downstream on the tweed nearer melrose the farm had the nickname of clarty hole and when scott built a family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions the farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace scott was a pioneer of the scottish baronial style of architecture therefore abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour trophies of the chase a library of more than  volumes fine furniture and still finer pictures panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the houseverification needed it is estimated that the building cost scott more than £ equivalent to £ in  more land was purchased until scott owned nearly  acres  km a roman road with a ford near melrose used in olden days by the abbots of melrose suggested the name of abbotsford scott was buried in dryburgh abbey where his wife had earlier been interred nearby is a large statue of william wallace one of scotlands many romanticised historical figures abbotsford later gave its name

assessmentedit although he continued to be extremely popular and widely read both at home and abroad scotts critical reputation declined in the last half of the th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism and scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children this trend accelerated in the th century for example in his classic study aspects of the novel  e m forster harshly criticized scotts clumsy and slapdash writing style flat characters and thin plots in contrast the novels of scotts contemporary jane austen once appreciated only by the discerning few including as it happened sir walter scott himself rose steadily in critical esteem though austen as a female writer was still faulted for her narrow feminine choice of subject matter which unlike scott avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine nevertheless scotts importance as an innovator continued to be recognized he was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel which others trace to jane porter whose work in the genre predates scotts and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in britain and on the european continent in the cultural sphere scotts waverley novels played a significant part in the movement begun with james macphersons ossian cycle in rehabilitating the public perception of the scottish highlands and its culture which had been formally suppressed as barbaric and viewed in the southern mind as a breeding ground of hill bandits religious fanaticism and jacobite rebellions scott served as chairman of the royal society of edinburgh and was also a member of the royal celtic society his own contribution to the reinvention of scottish culture was enormous even though his recreations of the customs of the highlands were fanciful at times despite his extensive travels around his native country it is a testament to scotts contribution in creating a unified identity for scotland that edinburghs central railway station opened in  by the north british railway is called waverley the fact that scott was a lowland presbyterian rather than a gaelicspeaking catholic highlander made him more acceptable to a conservative english reading public scotts novels were certainly influential in the making of the victorian craze for all things scottish among british royalty who were anxious to claim legitimacy through their rather attenuated historical connection with the royal house of stuartcitation needed at the time scott wrote scotland was poised to move away from an era of socially divisive clan warfare to a modern world of literacy and industrial capitalism through the medium of scotts novels the violent religious and political conflicts of the countrys recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which scott defined as the subtitle of waverley tis sixty years since indicates as something that happened at least  years ago scotts advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong though unspoken contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative english speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the french style on british soil scotts orchestration of king george ivs visit to scotland in  was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that in his view accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasimedieval bloodletting to be put to rest while envisioning a more useful peaceful future after scotts work had been essentially unstudied for many decades a revival of critical interest began from the s postmodern tastes favoured discontinuous narratives and the introduction of the first person yet they were more favourable to scotts work than modernist tastes while f r leavis had disdained scott seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence the great tradition  györgy lukács the historical novel  trans  and david daiches scotts achievement as a novelist  offered a marxian political reading of scotts fiction that generated a great deal of genuine interest in his work scott is now seen as an important innovator and a key figure in the development of scottish and world literature and particularly as the inventor of the historical novel memorials and commemorationedit the scott monument on edinburghs princes street statue by sir john steell on the scott monument in edinburgh scott monument in glasgows george square statue on the glasgow monument during his lifetime scotts portrait was painted by sir edwin landseer and fellowscots sir henry raeburn and james eckford lauder in edinburgh the metretall victorian gothic spire of the scott monument was designed by george meikle kemp it was completed in   years after scotts death and dominates the south side of princes street scott is also commemorated on a stone slab in makars court outside the writers museum lawnmarket edinburgh along with other prominent scottish writers quotes from his work are also visible on the canongate wall of the scottish parliament building in holyrood there is a tower dedicated to his memory on corstorphine hill in the west of the city and as mentioned edinburghs waverley railway station takes its name from one of his novels in glasgow walter scotts monument dominates the centre of george square the main public square in the city designed by david rhind in  the monument features a large column topped by a statue of scott there is a statue of scott in new york citys central park numerous masonic lodges have been named after him and his novels for example lodge sir walter scott no perth australia and lodge waverly no edinburgh scotland the annual walter scott prize for historical fiction was created in  by the duke and duchess of buccleuch whose ancestors were closely linked to sir walter scott at £ it is one of the largest prizes in british literature the award has been presented at scotts historic home abbotsford house scott has been credited with rescuing the scottish banknote in  there was outrage in scotland at the attempt of parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds scott wrote a series of letters to the edinburgh weekly journal under the pseudonym malachi malagrowther for retaining the right of scottish banks to issue their own banknotes this provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the scottish banks to continue printing pound notes this campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the bank of scotland the image on the  series of banknotes is based on the portrait by henry raeburn during and immediately after world war i there was a movement spearheaded by president wilson and other eminent people to inculcate patriotism in american school children especially immigrants and to stress the american connection with the literature and institutions of the mother country of great britain using selected readings in middle school textbooks scotts ivanhoe continued to be required reading for many american high school students until the end of the s a bust of scott is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling literature by other authorsedit in charles baudelaires la fanfarlo  poet samuel cramer says of scott oh that tedious author a dusty exhumer of chronicles a fastidious mass of descriptions of bricabrac  and castoff things of every sort armor tableware furniture gothic inns and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about dressed in leotards in the novella however cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of scotts novels in anne brontës the tenant of wildfell hall  the narrator gilbert markham brings an elegantly bound copy of marmion as a present to the independent tenant of wildfell hall helen graham whom he is courting and is mortified when she insists on paying for it in a speech delivered at salem massachusetts on  january  to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist john brown and his followers ralph waldo emerson calls brown an example of true chivalry which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that walter scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career in his  memoir army life in a black regiment new england abolitionist thomas wentworth higginson later editor of emily dickinson described how he wrote down and preserved negro spirituals or shouts while serving as a colonel in the first south carolina volunteers the first authorized union army regiment recruited from freedmen during the civil war memorialized in the  film glory he wrote that he was a faithful student of the scottish ballads and had always envied sir walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones according to his daughter eleanor scott was an author to whom karl marx again and again returned whom he admired and knew as well as he did balzac and fielding in his  life on the mississippi mark twain satirized the impact of scotts writings declaring with humorous hyperbole that scott had so large a hand in making southern character as it existed before the american civil war that he is in great measure responsible for the war he goes on to coin the term sir walter scott disease which he blames for the souths lack of advancement twain also targeted scott in adventures of huckleberry finn where he names a sinking boat the walter scott  and in a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court  the main character repeatedly utters great scott as an oath by the end of the book however he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armor reflecting twains ambivalence on the topic the idyllic cape cod retreat of suffragists

woolf mrs ramsey glances at her husband he was reading something that moved him very much  he was tossing the pages over he was acting it – perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book she wondered what book it was oh it was one of old sir walter’s she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above that people don’t read scott any more then her husband thought “that’s what they’ll say of me” so he went and got one of those books  scotts feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit’s cottage in the antiquary made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears  it fortified him he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening  and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn’t exist at all raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott’s hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie’s drowning and mucklebackit’s sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him well let them improve upon that he thought

presbyterian worship this led to the destitution of around  ministers who had refused to take an oath of allegiance and submit themselves to bishops and who continued to conduct worship among a remnant of their flock in caves and other remote country spots the relentless persecution of these conventicles and attempts to break them up by military force had led to open revolt the story is told from the point of view of henry morton a moderate presbyterian who is unwittingly drawn into the conflict and barely escapes summary execution in writing old mortality scott drew upon the knowledge he had acquired from his researches into ballads on the subject for the minstrelsy of the scottish border scotts background as a lawyer also informed his perspective for at the time of the novel which takes place before the act of union of  english law did not apply in scotland and afterwards scotland has continued to have its own scots law as a hybrid legal system a recent critic who is a legal as well as a literary scholar argues that old mortality not only reflects the dispute between stuarts absolute monarchy and the jurisdiction of the courts but also invokes a foundational moment in british sovereignty namely the habeas corpus act also known as the great writ passed by the english parliament in  oblique reference to the origin of habeas corpus underlies scotts next novel ivanhoe set during the era of the creation of the magna carta which political conservatives like walter scott and edmund burke regarded as rooted in immemorial british custom and precedent ivanhoe  set in thcentury england marked a move away from scotts focus on the local history of scotland based partly on humes history of england and the ballad cycle of robin hood ivanhoe was quickly translated into many languages and inspired countless imitations and theatrical adaptations ivanhoe depicts the cruel tyranny of the norman overlords norman yoke over the impoverished saxon populace of england with two of the main characters rowena and locksley robin hood representing the dispossessed saxon aristocracy when the protagonists are captured and imprisoned by a norman baron scott interrupts the story to exclaim it is grievous to think that those valiant barons to whose stand against the crown the liberties of england were indebted for their existence should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of england but to those of nature and humanity but alas fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period chapter  the institution of the magna carta which happens outside the time frame of the story is portrayed as a progressive incremental reform but also as a step towards the recovery of a lost golden age of liberty endemic to england and the english system scott puts a derisive prophecy in the mouth of the jester wamba norman saw on english oak on english neck a norman yoke norman spoon to english dish and england ruled as normans wish blithe world in england never will be more till englands rid of all the four ivanhoe ch xxvii although on the surface an entertaining escapist romance alert contemporary readers would have quickly recognised the political subtext of ivanhoe which appeared immediately after the english parliament fearful of frenchstyle revolution in the aftermath of waterloo had passed the habeas corpus suspension acts of  and  and other extremely repressive measures and when traditional english charter rights versus revolutionary human rights was a topic of discussion ivanhoe was also remarkable in its sympathetic portrayal of jewish characters rebecca considered by many critics the books real heroine does not in the end get to marry ivanhoe whom she loves but scott allows her to remain faithful to her own religion rather than having her convert to christianity likewise her father isaac of york a jewish moneylender is shown as a victim rather than a villain in ivanhoe which is one of scotts waverley novels religious and sectarian fanatics are the villains while the eponymous hero is a bystander who must weigh the evidence and decide where to take a stand scotts positive portrayal of judaism which reflects his humanity and concern for religious toleration also coincided with a contemporary movement for the emancipation of the jews in england recovery of the crown jewels baronetcy and ceremonial pageantryedit rediscovering the lost honours of scotland in  george iv landing at leith in  scotts fame grew as his explorations and interpretations of scottish history and society captured popular imagination impressed by this the prince regent the future george iv gave scott permission to conduct a search for the crown jewels honours of scotland during the years of the protectorate under cromwell the crown jewels had been hidden away but had subsequently been used to crown charles ii they were not used to crown subsequent monarchs but were regularly taken to sittings of parliament to represent the absent monarch until the act of union  thereafter the honours were stored in edinburgh castle but the large locked box in which they were stored was not opened for more than  years and stories circulated that they had been lost or removed in  scott and a small team of military men opened the box and unearthed the honours from the crown room in the depths of edinburgh castle a grateful prince regent granted scott the title of baronet and in march  he received the baronetcy in london becoming sir walter scott st baronet after georges accession to the throne the city council of edinburgh invited scott at the kings behest to stagemanage the  visit of king george iv to scotland with only three weeks for planning and execution scott created a spectacular and comprehensive pageant designed not only to impress the king but also in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised scots society he used the event to contribute to the drawing of a line under an old world that pitched his homeland into regular bouts of bloody strife he along with his production team mounted what in modern days could be termed a pr event in which the king was dressed in tartan and was greeted by his people many of whom were also dressed in similar tartan ceremonial dress this form of dress proscribed after the  rebellion against the english became one of the seminal potent and ubiquitous symbols of scottish identity in his novel kenilworth elizabeth i is welcomed to the castle of that name by means of an elaborate pageant the details of which scott was well qualified to itemize much of scotts autograph work shows an almost streamofconsciousness approach to writing he included little in the way of punctuation in his drafts leaving such details to the printers to supply he eventually acknowledged in  that he was the author of the waverley novels financial problems and deathedit sir walter scotts grave at dryburgh abbey in  a ukwide banking crisis resulted in the collapse of the ballantyne printing business of which scott was the only partner with a financial interest the companys debts of £ equivalent to £ in  caused his very public ruin rather than declare himself bankrupt or to accept any kind of financial support from his many supporters and admirers including the king himself he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and determined to write his way out of debt he kept up his prodigious output of fiction as well as producing a biography of napoleon bonaparte until  by then his health was failing but he nevertheless undertook a grand tour of europe and was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went he returned to scotland and in september  during the epidemic in scotland that year died of typhus at abbotsford the home he had designed and had built near melrose in the scottish borders his wife lady scott had died in  and was buried as an episcopalian two presbyterian ministers and one episcopalian officiated at his funeral scott died owing money but his novels continued to sell and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his death personal lifeedit scotts eldest son lt walter scott inherited his fathers estate and possessions he married jane jobson only daughter of william jobson of lochore died  and his wife rachel stuart died  on  february  scott srs lawyer from at least  was hay donaldson ws died  who was also agent to the duke of buccleuch scott was donaldsons proposer when he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh his distant cousin was the poet randall swingler abbotsfordedit abbotsford house tomb of walter scott in dryburgh abbey by henry fox talbot  when scott was a boy he sometimes travelled with his father from selkirk to melrose where some of his novels are set at a certain spot the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the battle of melrose  during the summers from  scott made his home at the large house of ashestiel on the south bank of the river tweed  miles  km north of selkirk when his lease on this property expired in  scott bought cartley hole farm downstream on the tweed nearer melrose the farm had the nickname of clarty hole and when scott built a family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions the farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace scott was a pioneer of the scottish baronial style of architecture therefore abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour trophies of the chase a library of more than  volumes fine furniture and still finer pictures panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the houseverification needed it is estimated that the building cost scott more than £ equivalent to £ in  more land was purchased until scott owned nearly  acres  km a roman road with a ford near melrose used in olden days by the abbots of melrose suggested the name of abbotsford scott was buried in dryburgh abbey where his wife had earlier been interred nearby is a large statue of william

veronese easter tory corporatism tory socialism pink tory ultratories v t e later assessmentedit although he continued to be extremely popular and widely read both at home and abroad scotts critical reputation declined in the last half of the th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism and scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children this trend accelerated in the th century for example in his classic study aspects of the novel  e m forster harshly criticized scotts clumsy and slapdash writing style flat characters and thin plots in contrast the novels of scotts contemporary jane austen once appreciated only by the discerning few including as it happened sir walter scott himself rose steadily in critical esteem though austen as a female writer was still faulted for her narrow feminine choice of subject matter which unlike scott avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine nevertheless scotts importance as an innovator continued to be recognized he was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel which others trace to jane porter whose work in the genre predates scotts and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in britain and on the european continent in the cultural sphere scotts waverley novels played a significant part in the movement begun with james macphersons ossian cycle in rehabilitating the public perception of the scottish highlands and its culture which had been formally suppressed as barbaric and viewed in the southern mind as a breeding ground of hill bandits religious fanaticism and jacobite rebellions scott served as chairman of the royal society of edinburgh and was also a member of the royal celtic society his own contribution to the reinvention of scottish culture was enormous even though his recreations of the customs of the highlands were fanciful at times despite his extensive travels around his native country it is a testament to scotts contribution in creating a unified identity for scotland that edinburghs central railway station opened in  by the north british railway is called waverley the fact that scott was a lowland presbyterian rather than a gaelicspeaking catholic highlander made him more acceptable to a conservative english reading public scotts novels were certainly influential in the making of the victorian craze for all things scottish among british royalty who were anxious to claim legitimacy through their rather attenuated historical connection with the royal house of stuartcitation needed at the time scott wrote scotland was poised to move away from an era of socially divisive clan warfare to a modern world of literacy and industrial capitalism through the medium of scotts novels the violent religious and political conflicts of the countrys recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which scott defined as the subtitle of waverley tis sixty years since indicates as something that happened at least  years ago scotts advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong though unspoken contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative english speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the french style on british soil scotts orchestration of king george ivs visit to scotland in  was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that in his view accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasimedieval bloodletting to be put to rest while envisioning a more useful peaceful future after scotts work had been essentially unstudied for many decades a revival of critical interest began from the s postmodern tastes favoured discontinuous narratives and the introduction of the first person yet they were more favourable to scotts work than modernist tastes while f r leavis had disdained scott seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence the great tradition  györgy lukács the historical novel  trans  and david daiches scotts achievement as a novelist  offered a marxian political reading of scotts fiction that generated a great deal of genuine interest in his work scott is now seen as an important innovator and a key figure in the development of scottish and world literature and particularly as the inventor of the historical novel memorials and commemorationedit the scott monument on edinburghs princes street statue by sir john steell on the scott monument in edinburgh scott monument in glasgows george square statue on the glasgow monument during his lifetime scotts portrait was painted by sir edwin landseer and fellowscots sir henry raeburn and james eckford lauder in edinburgh the metretall victorian gothic spire of the scott monument was designed by george meikle kemp it was completed in   years after scotts death and dominates the south side of princes street scott is also commemorated on a stone slab in makars court outside the writers museum lawnmarket edinburgh along with other prominent scottish writers quotes from his work are also visible on the canongate wall of the scottish parliament building in holyrood there is a tower dedicated to his memory on corstorphine hill in the west of the city and as mentioned edinburghs waverley railway station takes its name from one of his novels in glasgow walter scotts monument dominates the centre of george square the main public square in the city designed by david rhind in  the monument

walter scott no perth australia and lodge waverly no edinburgh scotland the annual walter scott prize for historical fiction was created in  by the duke and duchess of buccleuch whose ancestors were closely linked to sir walter scott at £ it is one of the largest prizes in british literature the award has been presented at scotts historic home abbotsford house scott has been credited with rescuing the scottish banknote in  there was outrage in scotland at the attempt of parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds scott wrote a series of letters to the edinburgh weekly journal under the pseudonym malachi malagrowther for retaining the right of scottish banks to issue their own banknotes this provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the scottish banks to continue printing pound notes this campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the bank of scotland the image on the  series of banknotes is based on the portrait by henry raeburn during and immediately after world war i there was a movement spearheaded by president wilson and other eminent people to inculcate patriotism in american school children especially immigrants and to stress the american connection with the literature and institutions of the mother country of great britain using selected readings in middle school textbooks scotts ivanhoe continued to be required reading for many american high school students until the end of the s a bust of scott is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling literature by other authorsedit in charles baudelaires la fanfarlo  poet samuel cramer says of scott oh that tedious author a dusty exhumer of chronicles a fastidious mass of descriptions of bricabrac  and castoff things of every sort armor tableware furniture gothic inns and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about dressed in leotards in the novella however cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of scotts novels in anne brontës the tenant of wildfell hall  the narrator gilbert markham brings an elegantly bound copy of marmion as a present to the independent tenant of wildfell hall helen graham whom he is courting and is mortified when she insists on paying for it in a speech delivered at salem massachusetts on  january  to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist john brown and his followers ralph waldo emerson calls brown an example of true chivalry which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that walter scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career in his  memoir army life in a black regiment new england abolitionist thomas wentworth higginson later editor of emily dickinson described how he wrote down and preserved negro spirituals or shouts while serving as a colonel in the first south carolina volunteers the first authorized union army regiment recruited from freedmen during the civil war memorialized in the  film glory he wrote that he was a faithful student of the scottish ballads and had always envied sir walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones according to his daughter eleanor scott was an author to whom karl marx again and again returned whom he admired and knew as well as he did balzac and fielding in his  life on the mississippi mark twain satirized the impact of scotts writings declaring with humorous hyperbole that scott had so large a hand in making southern character as it existed before the american civil war that he is in great measure responsible for the war he goes on to coin the term sir walter scott disease which he blames for the souths lack of advancement twain also targeted scott in adventures of huckleberry finn where he names a sinking boat the walter scott  and in a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court  the main character repeatedly utters great scott as an oath by the end of the book however he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armor reflecting twains ambivalence on the topic the idyllic cape cod retreat of suffragists verena tarrant and olive chancellor in henry james the bostonians  is called marmion evoking what james considered the quixotic idealism of these social reformers in to the lighthouse by virginia woolf mrs ramsey glances at her husband he was reading something that moved him very much  he was tossing the pages over he was acting it – perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book she wondered what book it was oh it was one of old sir walter’s she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above that people don’t read scott any more then her husband thought “that’s what they’ll say of me” so he went and got one of those books  scotts feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit’s cottage in the antiquary made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears  it fortified him he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening  and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn’t exist at all raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott’s hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie’s drowning and mucklebackit’s sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him well let them improve upon that he thought as he finished the chapter  the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman he thought returning to scott and balzac to the

family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions in  scott was offered the position of poet laureate he declined due to concerns that such an appointment would be a poisoned chalice as the laureateship had fallen into disrepute due to the decline in quality of work suffered by previous title holders  as a succession of poetasters had churned out conventional and obsequious odes on royal occasions he sought advice from the duke of buccleuch who counseled him to retain his literary independence and the position went to scotts friend robert southey novelismedit a legend of montrose illustration from the  edition although scott had attained worldwide celebrity through his poetry he soon tried his hand at documenting his researches into the oral tradition of the scottish borders in prose fiction—stories and novels—at the time still considered aesthetically inferior to poetry above all to such classical genres as the epic or poetic tragedy as a mimetic vehicle for portraying historical events in an innovative and astute action he wrote and published his first novel waverley anonymously in  it was a tale of the jacobite rising of  its english protagonist edward waverley like don quixote a great reader of romances has been brought up by his tory uncle who is sympathetic to jacobitism although edwards own father is a whig the youthful waverley obtains a commission in the whig army and is posted in dundee on leave he meets his uncles friend the jacobite baron bradwardine and is attracted to the barons daughter rose on a visit to the highlands edward overstays his leave and is arrested and charged with desertion but is rescued by the highland chieftain fergus macivor and his mesmerizing sister flora whose devotion to the stuart cause as it exceeded her brothers in fanaticism excelled it also in purity through flora waverley meets bonnie prince charlie and under her influence goes over to the jacobite side and takes part in the battle of prestonpans he escapes retribution however after saving the life of a whig colonel during the battle waverley whose surname reflects his divided loyalties eventually decides to lead a peaceful life of establishment respectability under the house of hanover rather than live as a proscribed rebel he chooses to marry the beautiful rose bradwardine rather than cast his lot with the sublime flora macivor who after the failure of the  rising retires to a french convent there followed a succession of novels over the next five years each with a scottish historical setting mindful of his reputation as a poet scott maintained the anonymity he had begun with waverley publishing the novels under the name author of waverley or as tales of with no author among those familiar with his poetry his identity became an open secret but scott persisted in maintaining the façade perhaps because he thought his oldfashioned father would disapprove of his engaging in such a trivial pursuit as novel writing during this time scott became known by the nickname the wizard of the north in  he was given the honour of dining with george prince regent who wanted to meet the author of waverley edgar and lucie at mermaidens well by charles robert leslie  after sir walter scotts bride of lammermoor lucie is wearing a full plaid scotts  series tales of my landlord is sometimes considered a subset of the waverley novels and was intended to illustrate aspects of scottish regional life among the best known is the bride of lammermoor a fictionalized version of an actual incident in the history of the dalrymple family that took place in the lammermuir hills in  in the novel lucie ashton and the nobly born but now dispossessed and impoverished edgar ravenswood exchange vows but the ravenswoods and the wealthy ashtons who now own the former ravenswood lands are enemies and lucies mother forces her daughter to break her engagement to edgar and marry the wealthy sir arthur bucklaw lucie falls into a depression and on their wedding night stabs the bridegroom succumbs to insanity and dies in  french romantic painter eugène delacroix painted a portrait depicting himself as the melancholy disinherited edgar ravenswood the prolonged climactic coloratura mad scene for lucia in donizettis  bel canto opera lucia di lammermoor is based on what in the novel were just a few bland sentences tales of my landlord includes the now highly regarded novel old mortality set in – against the backdrop of the ferocious anticovenanting campaign of the tory graham of claverhouse subsequently made viscount dundee called bluidy clavers by his opponents but later dubbed bonnie dundee by scott the covenanters were presbyterians who had supported the restoration of charles ii on promises of a presbyterian settlement but he had instead reintroduced episcopalian church government with draconian penalties for presbyterian worship this led to the destitution of around  ministers who had refused to take an oath of allegiance and submit themselves to bishops and who continued to conduct worship among a remnant of their flock in caves and other remote country spots the relentless persecution of these conventicles and attempts to break them up by military force had led to open revolt the story is told from the point of view of henry morton a moderate presbyterian who is unwittingly drawn into the conflict and barely escapes summary execution in writing old mortality scott drew upon the knowledge he had acquired from his researches into ballads on the subject for the minstrelsy of the scottish border scotts background as a lawyer also informed his perspective for at the time of the novel which takes place before the act of union of  english law did not apply in scotland and afterwards scotland has continued to have its own scots law as a hybrid legal system a recent critic who is a legal as well as a literary scholar argues that old mortality not only reflects the dispute between stuarts absolute monarchy and the jurisdiction of the courts but also invokes a foundational moment in british sovereignty namely the habeas corpus act also known as the great writ passed by the english parliament in  oblique reference to the origin of habeas corpus underlies scotts next novel ivanhoe set during the era of the creation of the magna carta which political conservatives like walter scott and edmund burke regarded as rooted in immemorial british custom and precedent ivanhoe  set in thcentury england marked a move away from scotts focus on the local history of scotland based partly on humes history of england and the ballad cycle of robin hood ivanhoe was quickly translated into many languages and inspired countless imitations and theatrical adaptations ivanhoe depicts the cruel tyranny of the norman overlords norman yoke over the impoverished saxon populace of england with two of the main characters rowena and locksley robin hood representing the dispossessed saxon aristocracy when the protagonists are captured and imprisoned by a norman baron scott interrupts the story to exclaim it is grievous to think that those valiant barons to whose stand against the crown the liberties of england were indebted for their existence should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of england but to those of nature and humanity but alas fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period chapter  the institution of the magna carta which happens outside the time frame of the story is portrayed as a progressive incremental reform but also as a step towards the recovery of a lost golden age of liberty endemic to england and the english system scott puts a derisive prophecy in the mouth of the jester wamba norman saw on english oak on english neck a norman yoke norman spoon to english dish and england ruled as normans wish blithe world in england never will be more till englands rid of all the four ivanhoe ch xxvii although on the surface an entertaining escapist romance alert contemporary readers would have quickly recognised the political subtext of ivanhoe which appeared immediately after the english parliament fearful of frenchstyle revolution in the aftermath of waterloo had passed the habeas corpus suspension acts of  and  and other extremely repressive measures and when traditional english charter rights versus revolutionary human rights was a topic of discussion ivanhoe was also remarkable in its sympathetic portrayal of jewish characters rebecca considered by many critics the books real heroine does not in the end get to marry ivanhoe whom she loves but scott allows her to remain faithful to her own religion rather than having her convert to christianity likewise her father isaac of york a jewish moneylender is shown as a victim rather than a villain in ivanhoe which is one of scotts waverley novels religious and sectarian fanatics are the villains while the eponymous hero is a bystander who must weigh the evidence and decide where to take a stand scotts positive portrayal of judaism which reflects his humanity and concern for religious toleration also coincided with a contemporary movement for the emancipation of the jews in england recovery of the crown jewels baronetcy and ceremonial pageantryedit rediscovering the lost honours of scotland in  george iv landing at leith in  scotts fame grew as his explorations and interpretations of scottish history and society captured popular imagination impressed by this the prince regent the future george iv gave scott permission to conduct a search for the crown jewels honours of scotland during the years of the protectorate under cromwell the crown jewels had been hidden away but had subsequently been used to crown charles ii they were not used to crown subsequent monarchs but were regularly taken to sittings of parliament to represent the absent monarch until the act of union  thereafter the honours were stored in edinburgh castle but the large locked box in which they were stored was not opened for more than  years and stories circulated that they had been lost or removed in  scott and a small team of military men opened the box and unearthed the honours from the crown room in the depths of edinburgh castle a grateful prince regent granted scott the title of baronet and in march  he received the baronetcy in london becoming sir walter scott st baronet after georges accession to the throne the city council of edinburgh invited scott at the kings behest to stagemanage the  visit of king george iv to scotland with only three weeks for planning and execution scott created a spectacular and comprehensive pageant designed not only to impress the king but also in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised scots society he used the event to contribute to the drawing of a line under an old world that pitched his homeland into regular bouts of bloody strife he along with his production team mounted what in modern days could be termed a pr event in which the king was dressed in tartan and was greeted by his people many of whom were also dressed in similar tartan ceremonial dress this form of dress proscribed after the  rebellion against the english became one of the seminal potent and ubiquitous symbols of scottish identity in his novel kenilworth elizabeth i is welcomed to the castle of that name by means of an elaborate pageant the details of which scott was well qualified to itemize much of scotts autograph work shows an almost streamofconsciousness approach to writing he included little in the way of punctuation in his drafts leaving such details to the printers to supply he eventually acknowledged in  that he was the author of the waverley novels financial problems and deathedit sir walter scotts grave at dryburgh abbey in  a ukwide banking crisis resulted in the collapse of the ballantyne printing business of which scott was the only partner with a financial interest the companys debts of £ equivalent to £ in  caused his very public ruin rather than declare himself bankrupt or to accept any kind of financial support from his many supporters and admirers including the king himself he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and determined to write his way out of debt he kept up his prodigious output of fiction as well as producing a biography of napoleon bonaparte until  by then his health was failing but he nevertheless undertook a grand tour of europe and was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went he returned to scotland and in september  during the epidemic in scotland that year died of typhus at abbotsford the home he had designed and had built near melrose in the scottish borders his wife lady scott had died in  and was buried as an episcopalian two presbyterian ministers and one episcopalian officiated at his funeral scott died owing money but his novels continued to sell and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his death personal lifeedit scotts eldest son lt walter scott inherited his fathers estate and possessions he married jane jobson only daughter of william jobson of lochore died  and his wife rachel stuart died  on  february  scott srs lawyer from at least  was hay donaldson ws died  who was also agent to the duke of buccleuch scott was donaldsons proposer when he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh his distant cousin was the poet randall swingler abbotsfordedit abbotsford house tomb of walter scott in dryburgh abbey by henry fox talbot  when scott was a boy he sometimes travelled with his father from selkirk to melrose where some of his novels are set at a certain spot the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the battle of melrose  during the summers from  scott made his home at the large house of ashestiel on the south bank of the river tweed  miles  km north of selkirk when his lease on this property expired in  scott bought cartley hole farm downstream on the tweed nearer melrose the farm had the nickname of clarty hole and when scott built a family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions the farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace scott was a pioneer of the scottish baronial style of architecture therefore abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour trophies of the chase a library of more than  volumes fine furniture and still finer pictures panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the houseverification needed it is estimated that the building cost scott more than £ equivalent to £ in  more land was purchased until scott owned nearly  acres  km a roman road with a ford near

reputation declined in the last half of the th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism and scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children this trend accelerated in the th century for example in his classic study aspects of the novel  e m forster harshly criticized scotts clumsy and slapdash writing style flat characters and thin plots in contrast the novels of scotts contemporary jane austen once appreciated only by the discerning few including as it happened sir walter scott himself rose steadily in critical esteem though austen as a female writer was still faulted for her narrow feminine choice of subject matter which unlike scott avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine nevertheless scotts importance as an innovator continued to be recognized he was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel which others trace to jane porter whose work in the genre predates scotts and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in britain and on the european continent in the cultural sphere scotts waverley novels played a significant part in the movement begun with james macphersons ossian cycle in rehabilitating the public perception of the scottish highlands and its culture which had been formally suppressed as barbaric and viewed in the southern mind as a breeding ground of hill bandits religious fanaticism and jacobite rebellions scott served as chairman of the royal society of edinburgh and was also a member of the royal celtic society his own contribution to the reinvention of scottish culture was enormous even though his recreations of the customs of the highlands were fanciful at times despite his extensive travels around his native country it is a testament to scotts contribution in creating a unified identity for scotland that edinburghs central railway station opened in  by the north british railway is called waverley the fact that scott was a lowland presbyterian rather than a gaelicspeaking catholic highlander made him more acceptable to a conservative english reading public scotts novels were certainly influential in the making of the victorian craze for all things scottish among british royalty who were anxious to claim legitimacy through their rather attenuated historical connection with the royal house of stuartcitation needed at the time scott wrote scotland was poised to move away from an era of socially divisive clan warfare to a modern world of literacy and industrial capitalism through the medium of scotts novels the violent religious and political conflicts of the countrys recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which scott defined as the subtitle of waverley tis sixty years since indicates as something that happened at least  years ago scotts advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong though unspoken contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative english speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the french style on british soil scotts orchestration of king george ivs visit to scotland in  was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that in his view accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasimedieval bloodletting to be put to rest while envisioning a more useful peaceful future after scotts work had been essentially unstudied for many decades a revival of critical interest began from the s postmodern tastes favoured discontinuous narratives and the introduction of the first person yet they were more favourable to scotts work than modernist tastes while f r leavis had disdained scott seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence the great tradition  györgy lukács the historical novel  trans  and david daiches scotts achievement as a novelist  offered a marxian political reading of scotts fiction that generated a great deal of genuine interest in his work scott is now seen as an important innovator and a key figure in the development of scottish and world literature and particularly as the inventor of the historical novel memorials and commemorationedit the scott monument on edinburghs princes street statue by sir john steell on the scott monument in edinburgh scott

closely linked to sir walter scott at £ it is one of the largest prizes in british literature the award has been presented at scotts historic home abbotsford house scott has been credited with rescuing the scottish banknote in  there was outrage in scotland at the attempt of parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds scott wrote a series of letters to the edinburgh weekly journal under the pseudonym malachi malagrowther for retaining the right of scottish banks to issue their own banknotes this provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the scottish banks to continue printing pound notes this campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the bank of scotland the image on the  series of banknotes is based on the portrait by henry raeburn during and immediately after world war i there was a movement spearheaded by president wilson and other eminent people to inculcate patriotism in american school children especially immigrants and to stress the american connection with the literature and institutions of the mother country of great britain using selected readings in middle school textbooks scotts ivanhoe continued to be required reading for many american high school students until the end of the s a bust of scott is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling literature by other authorsedit in charles baudelaires la fanfarlo  poet samuel cramer says of scott oh that tedious author a dusty exhumer of chronicles a fastidious mass of descriptions of bricabrac  and castoff things of every sort armor tableware furniture gothic inns and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about dressed in leotards in the novella however cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of scotts novels in anne brontës the tenant of wildfell hall  the narrator gilbert markham brings an elegantly bound copy of marmion as a present to the independent tenant of wildfell hall helen graham whom he is courting and is mortified when she insists on paying for it in a speech delivered at salem massachusetts on  january  to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist john brown and his followers ralph waldo emerson calls brown an example of true chivalry which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that walter scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career in his  memoir army life in a black regiment new england abolitionist thomas wentworth higginson later editor of emily dickinson described how he wrote down and preserved negro spirituals or shouts while serving as a colonel in the first south carolina volunteers the first authorized union army regiment recruited from freedmen during the civil war memorialized in the  film glory he wrote that he was a faithful student of the scottish ballads and had always envied sir walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones according to his daughter eleanor scott was an author to whom karl marx again and again returned whom he admired and knew as well as he did balzac and fielding in his  life on the mississippi mark twain satirized the impact of scotts writings declaring with humorous hyperbole that scott had so large a hand in making southern character as it existed before the american civil war that he is in great measure responsible for the war he goes on to coin the term sir walter scott disease which he blames for the souths lack of advancement twain also targeted scott in adventures of huckleberry finn where he names a sinking boat the walter scott  and in a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court  the main character repeatedly utters great scott as an oath by the end of the book however he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armor reflecting twains ambivalence on the topic the idyllic cape cod retreat of suffragists verena tarrant and olive chancellor in henry james the bostonians  is called marmion evoking what james considered the quixotic idealism of these social reformers in to the lighthouse by virginia woolf mrs ramsey glances at her husband he was reading something that moved him very much  he was tossing the pages over he was acting it – perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book she wondered what book it was oh it was one of old sir walter’s she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above that people don’t read scott any more then her husband thought “that’s what they’ll say of me” so he went and got one of those books  scotts feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit’s cottage in the antiquary made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears  it fortified him he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening  and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn’t exist at all raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott’s hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie’s drowning and mucklebackit’s sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him well let them improve upon that he thought as he finished the chapter  the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman he thought returning to scott and balzac to the

family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions in  scott was offered the position of poet laureate he declined due to concerns that such an appointment would be a poisoned chalice as the laureateship had fallen into disrepute due to the decline in quality of work suffered by previous title holders  as a succession of poetasters had churned out conventional and obsequious odes on royal occasions he sought advice from the duke of buccleuch who counseled him to retain his literary independence and the position went to scotts friend robert southey novelismedit a legend of montrose illustration from the  edition although scott had attained worldwide celebrity through his poetry he soon tried his hand at documenting his researches into the oral tradition of the scottish borders in prose fiction—stories and novels—at the time still considered aesthetically inferior to poetry above all to such classical genres as the epic or poetic tragedy as a mimetic vehicle for portraying historical events in an innovative and astute action he wrote and published his first novel waverley anonymously in  it was a tale of the jacobite rising of  its english protagonist edward waverley like don quixote a great reader of romances has been brought up by his tory uncle who is sympathetic to jacobitism although edwards own father is a whig the youthful waverley obtains a commission in the whig army and is posted in dundee on leave he meets his uncles friend the jacobite baron bradwardine and is attracted to the barons daughter rose on a visit to the highlands edward overstays his leave and is arrested and charged with desertion but is rescued by the highland chieftain fergus macivor and his mesmerizing sister flora whose devotion to the stuart cause as it exceeded her brothers in fanaticism excelled it also in purity through flora waverley meets bonnie prince charlie and under her influence goes over to the jacobite side and takes part in the battle of prestonpans he escapes retribution however after saving the life of a whig colonel during the battle waverley whose surname reflects his divided loyalties eventually decides to lead a peaceful life of establishment respectability under the house of hanover rather than live as a proscribed rebel he chooses to marry the beautiful rose bradwardine rather than cast his lot with the sublime flora macivor who after the failure of the  rising retires to a french convent there followed a succession of novels over the next five years each with a scottish historical setting mindful of his reputation as a poet scott maintained the anonymity he had begun with waverley publishing the novels under the name author of waverley or as tales of with no author among those familiar with his poetry his identity became an open secret but scott persisted in maintaining the façade perhaps because he thought his oldfashioned father would disapprove of his engaging in such a trivial pursuit as novel writing during this time scott became known by the nickname the wizard of the north in  he was given the honour of dining with george prince regent who wanted to meet the author of waverley edgar and lucie at mermaidens well by charles robert leslie  after sir walter scotts bride of lammermoor lucie is wearing a full plaid scotts  series tales of my landlord is sometimes considered a subset of the waverley novels and was intended to illustrate aspects of scottish regional life among the best known is the bride of lammermoor a fictionalized version of an actual incident in the history of the dalrymple family that took place in the lammermuir hills in  in the novel lucie ashton and the nobly born but now dispossessed and impoverished edgar ravenswood exchange vows but the ravenswoods and the wealthy ashtons who now own the former ravenswood lands are enemies and lucies mother forces her daughter to break her engagement to edgar and marry the wealthy sir arthur bucklaw lucie falls into a depression and on their wedding night stabs the bridegroom succumbs to insanity and dies in  french romantic painter eugène delacroix painted a portrait depicting himself as the melancholy disinherited edgar ravenswood the prolonged climactic coloratura mad scene for lucia in donizettis  bel canto opera lucia di lammermoor is based on what in the novel were just a few bland sentences tales of my landlord includes the now highly regarded novel old mortality set in – against the backdrop of the ferocious anticovenanting campaign of the tory graham of claverhouse subsequently made viscount dundee called bluidy clavers by his opponents but later dubbed bonnie dundee by scott the covenanters were presbyterians who had supported the restoration of charles ii on promises of a presbyterian settlement but he had instead reintroduced episcopalian church government with draconian penalties for presbyterian worship this led to the destitution of around  ministers who had refused to take an oath of allegiance and submit themselves to bishops and who continued to conduct worship among a remnant of their flock in caves and other remote country spots the relentless persecution of these conventicles and attempts to break them up by military force had led to open revolt the story is told from the point of view of henry morton a moderate presbyterian who is unwittingly drawn into the conflict and barely escapes summary execution in writing old mortality scott drew upon the knowledge he had acquired from his researches into ballads on the subject for the minstrelsy of the scottish border scotts background as a lawyer also informed his perspective for at the time of the novel which takes place before the act of union of  english law did not apply in scotland and afterwards scotland has continued to have its own scots law as a hybrid legal system a recent critic who is a legal as well as a literary scholar argues that old mortality not only reflects the dispute between stuarts absolute monarchy and the jurisdiction of the courts but also invokes a foundational moment in british sovereignty namely the habeas corpus act also known as the great writ passed by the english parliament in  oblique reference to the origin of habeas corpus underlies scotts next novel ivanhoe set during the era of the creation of the magna carta which political conservatives like walter scott and edmund burke regarded as rooted in immemorial british custom and precedent ivanhoe  set in thcentury england marked a move away from scotts focus on the local history of scotland based partly on humes history of england and the ballad cycle of robin hood ivanhoe was quickly translated into many languages and inspired countless imitations and theatrical adaptations ivanhoe depicts the cruel tyranny of the norman overlords norman yoke over the impoverished saxon populace of england with two of the main characters rowena and locksley robin hood representing the dispossessed saxon aristocracy when the protagonists are captured and imprisoned by a norman baron scott interrupts the story to exclaim it is grievous to think that those valiant barons to whose stand against the crown the liberties of england were indebted for their existence should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of england but to those of nature and humanity but alas fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period chapter  the institution of the magna carta which happens outside the time frame of the story is portrayed as a progressive incremental reform but also as a step towards the recovery of a lost golden age of liberty endemic to england and the english system scott puts a derisive prophecy in the mouth of the jester wamba norman saw on english oak on english neck a norman yoke norman spoon to english dish and england ruled as normans wish blithe world in england never will be more till englands rid of all the four ivanhoe ch xxvii although on the surface an entertaining escapist romance alert contemporary readers would have quickly recognised the political subtext of ivanhoe which appeared immediately after the english parliament fearful of frenchstyle revolution in the aftermath of waterloo had passed the habeas corpus suspension acts of  and  and other extremely repressive measures and when traditional english charter rights versus revolutionary human rights was a topic of discussion ivanhoe was also remarkable in its sympathetic portrayal of jewish characters rebecca considered by many critics the books real heroine does not in the end get to marry ivanhoe whom she loves but scott allows her to remain faithful to her own religion rather than having her convert to christianity likewise her father isaac of york a jewish moneylender is shown as a victim rather than a villain in ivanhoe which is one of scotts waverley novels religious and sectarian fanatics are the villains while the eponymous hero is a bystander who must weigh the evidence and decide where to take a stand scotts positive portrayal of judaism which reflects his humanity and concern for religious toleration also coincided with a contemporary movement for the emancipation of the jews in england recovery of the crown jewels baronetcy and ceremonial pageantryedit rediscovering the lost honours of scotland in  george iv landing at leith in  scotts fame grew as his explorations and interpretations of scottish history and society captured popular imagination impressed by this the prince regent the future george iv gave scott permission to conduct a search for the crown jewels honours of scotland during the years of the protectorate under cromwell the crown jewels had been hidden away but had subsequently been used to crown charles ii they were not used to crown subsequent monarchs but were regularly taken to sittings of parliament to represent the absent monarch until the act of union  thereafter the honours were stored in edinburgh castle but the large locked box in which they were stored was not opened for more than  years and stories circulated that they had been lost or removed in  scott and a small team of military men opened the box and unearthed the honours from the crown room in the depths of edinburgh castle a grateful prince regent granted scott the title of baronet and in march  he received the baronetcy in london becoming sir walter scott st baronet after georges accession to the throne the city council of edinburgh invited scott at the kings behest to stagemanage the  visit of king george iv to scotland with only three weeks for planning and execution scott created a spectacular and comprehensive pageant designed not only to impress the king but also in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised scots society he used the event to contribute to the drawing of a line under an old world that pitched his homeland into regular bouts of bloody strife he along with his production team mounted what in modern days could be termed a pr event in which the king was dressed in tartan and was greeted by his people many of whom were also dressed in similar tartan ceremonial dress this form of dress proscribed after the  rebellion against the english became one of the seminal potent and ubiquitous symbols of scottish identity in his novel kenilworth elizabeth i is welcomed to the castle of that name by means of an elaborate pageant the details of which scott was well qualified to itemize much of scotts autograph work shows an almost streamofconsciousness approach to writing he included little in the way of punctuation in his drafts leaving such details to the printers to supply he eventually acknowledged in  that he was the author of the waverley novels financial problems and deathedit sir walter scotts grave at dryburgh abbey in  a ukwide banking crisis resulted in the collapse of the ballantyne printing business of which scott was the only partner with a financial interest the companys debts of £ equivalent to £ in  caused his very public ruin rather than declare himself bankrupt or to accept any kind of financial support from his many supporters and admirers including the king himself he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and determined to write his way out of debt he kept up his prodigious output of fiction as well as producing a biography of napoleon bonaparte until  by then his health was failing but he nevertheless undertook a grand tour of europe and was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went he returned to scotland and in september  during the epidemic in scotland that year died of typhus at abbotsford the home he had designed and had built near melrose in the scottish borders his wife lady scott had died in  and was buried as an episcopalian two presbyterian ministers and one episcopalian officiated at his funeral scott died owing money but his novels continued to sell and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his

sometimes travelled with his father from selkirk to melrose where some of his novels are set at a certain spot the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the battle of melrose  during the summers from  scott made his home at the large house of ashestiel on the south bank of the river tweed  miles  km north of selkirk when his lease on this property expired in  scott bought cartley hole farm downstream on the tweed nearer melrose the farm had the nickname of clarty hole and when scott built a family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions the farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace scott was a pioneer of the scottish baronial style of architecture therefore abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour trophies of the chase a library of more than  volumes fine furniture and still finer pictures panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the houseverification needed it is estimated that the building cost scott more than £ equivalent to £ in  more land was purchased until scott owned nearly  acres  km a roman road with a ford near

reputation declined in the last half of the th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism and scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children this trend accelerated in the th century for example in his classic study aspects of the novel  e m forster harshly criticized scotts clumsy and slapdash writing style flat characters and thin plots in contrast the novels of scotts contemporary jane austen once appreciated only by the discerning few including as it happened sir walter scott himself rose steadily in critical esteem though austen as a female writer was still faulted for her narrow feminine choice of subject matter which unlike scott avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine nevertheless scotts importance as an innovator continued to be recognized he was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel which others trace to jane porter whose work in the genre predates scotts and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in britain and on the european continent in the cultural sphere scotts waverley novels played a significant part in the movement begun with james macphersons ossian cycle in rehabilitating the public perception of the scottish highlands and its culture which had been formally suppressed as barbaric and viewed in the southern mind as a breeding ground of hill bandits religious fanaticism and jacobite rebellions scott served as chairman of the royal society of edinburgh and was also a member of the royal celtic society his own contribution to the reinvention of scottish culture was enormous even though his recreations of the customs of the highlands were fanciful at times despite his extensive travels around his native country it is a testament to scotts contribution in creating a unified identity for scotland that edinburghs central railway station opened in  by the north british railway is called waverley the fact that scott was a lowland presbyterian rather than a gaelicspeaking catholic highlander made him more acceptable to a conservative english reading public scotts novels were certainly influential in the making of the victorian craze for all things scottish among british royalty who were anxious to claim legitimacy through their rather attenuated historical connection with the royal house of stuartcitation needed at the time scott wrote scotland was poised to move away from an era of socially divisive clan warfare to a modern world of literacy and industrial capitalism through the medium of scotts novels the violent religious and political conflicts of the countrys recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which scott defined as the subtitle of waverley tis sixty years since indicates as something that happened at least  years ago scotts advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong though unspoken contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative english speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the french style on british soil scotts orchestration of king george ivs visit to scotland in  was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that in his view accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasimedieval bloodletting to be put to rest while envisioning a more useful peaceful future after scotts work had been essentially unstudied for many decades a revival of critical interest began from the s postmodern tastes favoured discontinuous narratives and the introduction of the first person yet they were more favourable to scotts work than modernist tastes while f r leavis had disdained scott seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence the great tradition  györgy lukács the historical novel  trans  and david daiches scotts achievement as a novelist  offered a marxian political reading of scotts fiction that generated a great deal of genuine interest in his work scott is now seen as an important innovator and a key figure in the development of scottish and world literature and particularly as the inventor of the historical novel memorials and commemorationedit the scott monument on edinburghs princes street statue by sir john steell on the scott monument in edinburgh scott monument in glasgows george square statue on the glasgow monument during his lifetime scotts portrait was painted by sir edwin landseer and fellowscots sir henry raeburn and james eckford lauder in

walter scott no perth australia and lodge waverly no edinburgh scotland the annual walter scott prize for historical fiction was created in  by the duke and duchess of buccleuch whose ancestors were closely linked to sir walter scott at £ it is one of the largest prizes in british literature the award has been presented at scotts historic home abbotsford house scott has been credited with rescuing the scottish banknote in  there was outrage in scotland at the attempt of parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds scott wrote a series of letters to the edinburgh weekly journal under the pseudonym malachi malagrowther for retaining the right of scottish banks to issue their own banknotes this provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the scottish banks to continue printing pound notes this campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the bank of scotland the image on the  series of banknotes is based on the portrait by henry raeburn during and immediately after world war i there was a movement spearheaded by president wilson and other eminent people to inculcate patriotism in american school children especially immigrants and to stress the american connection with the literature and institutions of the mother country of great britain using selected readings in middle school textbooks scotts ivanhoe continued to be required reading for many american high school students until the end of the s a bust of scott is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling literature by other authorsedit in charles baudelaires la fanfarlo  poet samuel cramer says of scott oh that tedious author a dusty exhumer of chronicles a fastidious mass of descriptions of bricabrac  and castoff things of every sort armor tableware furniture gothic inns and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about dressed in leotards in the novella however cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of scotts novels in anne brontës the tenant of wildfell hall  the narrator gilbert markham brings an elegantly bound copy of marmion as a present to the independent tenant of wildfell hall helen graham whom he is courting and is mortified when she insists on paying for it in a speech delivered at salem massachusetts on  january  to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist john brown and his followers ralph waldo emerson calls brown an example of true chivalry which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that walter scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career in his  memoir army life in a black regiment new england abolitionist thomas wentworth higginson later editor of emily dickinson described how he wrote down and preserved negro spirituals or shouts while serving as a colonel in the first south carolina volunteers the first authorized union army regiment recruited from freedmen during the civil war memorialized in the  film glory he wrote that he was a faithful student of the scottish ballads and had always envied sir walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones according to his daughter eleanor scott was an author to whom karl marx again and again returned whom he admired and knew as well as he did balzac and fielding in his  life on the mississippi mark twain satirized the impact of scotts writings declaring with humorous hyperbole that scott had so large a hand in making southern character as it existed before the american civil war that he is in great measure responsible for the war he goes on to coin the term sir walter scott disease which he blames for the souths lack of advancement twain also targeted scott in adventures of huckleberry finn where he names a sinking boat the walter scott  and in a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court  the main character repeatedly utters great scott as an oath by the end of the book however he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armor reflecting twains

idealism of these social reformers in to the lighthouse by virginia woolf mrs ramsey glances at her husband he was reading something that moved him very much  he was tossing the pages over he was acting it – perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book she wondered what book it was oh it was one of old sir walter’s she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above that people don’t read scott any more then her husband thought “that’s what they’ll say of me” so he went and got one of those books  scotts feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit’s cottage in the antiquary made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears  it fortified him he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening  and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn’t exist at all raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott’s hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie’s drowning and mucklebackit’s sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him well let them improve upon that he thought as he finished the chapter  the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman he thought returning to scott and balzac to the

attracted to the barons daughter rose on a visit to the highlands edward overstays his leave and is arrested and charged with desertion but is rescued by the highland chieftain fergus macivor and his mesmerizing sister flora whose devotion to the stuart cause as it exceeded her brothers in fanaticism excelled it also in purity through flora waverley meets bonnie prince charlie and under her influence goes over to the jacobite side and takes part in the battle of prestonpans he escapes retribution however after saving the life of a whig colonel during the battle waverley whose surname reflects his divided loyalties eventually decides to lead a peaceful life of establishment respectability under the house of hanover rather than live as a proscribed rebel he chooses to marry the beautiful rose bradwardine rather than cast his lot with the sublime flora macivor who after the failure of the  rising retires to a french convent there followed a succession of novels over the next five years each with a scottish historical setting mindful of his reputation as a poet scott maintained the anonymity he had begun with waverley publishing the novels under the name author of waverley or as tales of with no author among those familiar with his poetry his identity became an open secret but scott persisted in maintaining the façade perhaps because he thought his oldfashioned father would disapprove of his engaging in such a trivial pursuit as novel writing during this time scott became known by the nickname the wizard of the north in  he was given the honour of dining with

dispossessed and impoverished edgar ravenswood exchange vows but the ravenswoods and the wealthy ashtons who now own the former ravenswood lands are enemies and lucies mother forces her daughter to break her engagement to edgar and marry the wealthy sir arthur bucklaw lucie falls into a depression and on their wedding night stabs the bridegroom succumbs to insanity and dies in  french romantic painter eugène delacroix painted a portrait depicting himself as the melancholy disinherited edgar ravenswood the prolonged climactic coloratura mad scene for lucia in donizettis  bel canto opera

ferocious anticovenanting campaign of the tory graham of claverhouse subsequently made viscount dundee called bluidy clavers by his opponents but later dubbed bonnie dundee by scott the covenanters were presbyterians who had supported the restoration of charles ii on promises of a presbyterian settlement but he had instead reintroduced episcopalian church government with draconian penalties for presbyterian worship this led to the destitution of around  ministers who had refused to take an oath of allegiance and submit themselves to bishops and who continued to conduct worship among a remnant of their flock in caves and other remote country spots the relentless persecution of these conventicles and attempts to break them up by military force had led to open revolt the story is told from the point of view of henry morton a moderate presbyterian who is unwittingly drawn into the conflict and barely escapes summary execution in writing old mortality scott drew upon the knowledge he had acquired from his researches into ballads on the subject for the minstrelsy of the scottish border scotts background as a lawyer also informed his perspective for at the time of the novel which takes place before the act of union of  english law did not apply in scotland and afterwards scotland has continued to have its own scots law as a hybrid legal system a recent critic who is a legal as well as a literary scholar argues that old mortality not only reflects the dispute between stuarts absolute monarchy and the jurisdiction of the courts but also invokes a foundational moment in british sovereignty namely the habeas corpus act also known as the great writ passed by the english parliament in  oblique reference to the origin of habeas corpus underlies scotts next novel ivanhoe set during the era of the creation of the magna carta which political conservatives like walter scott and edmund burke regarded as rooted in immemorial british custom and precedent ivanhoe  set in thcentury england marked a move away from scotts focus on the local history of scotland based partly on humes history of england and the ballad cycle of robin hood ivanhoe was quickly translated into many languages and inspired countless imitations and theatrical adaptations ivanhoe depicts the cruel tyranny of the norman overlords norman yoke over the impoverished saxon populace of england with two of the main characters rowena and locksley robin hood representing the dispossessed saxon aristocracy when the protagonists are captured and imprisoned by a norman baron scott interrupts the story to exclaim it is grievous to think that those valiant barons to whose stand against the crown the liberties of england were indebted for their existence should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of england but to those of nature and humanity but alas fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period chapter  the institution of the magna carta which happens outside the time frame of the story is portrayed as a progressive incremental reform but also as a step towards the recovery of a lost golden age of liberty endemic to england and the english system scott puts a derisive prophecy in the mouth of the jester wamba norman saw on english oak on english neck a norman yoke norman spoon to english dish and england ruled as normans wish blithe world in england never will be more till englands rid of all the four ivanhoe ch xxvii although on the surface an entertaining escapist romance alert contemporary readers would have quickly recognised the political subtext of ivanhoe which appeared immediately after the english parliament fearful of frenchstyle revolution in the aftermath of waterloo had passed the habeas corpus suspension acts of  and  and other extremely repressive measures and when traditional english charter rights versus revolutionary human rights was a topic of discussion ivanhoe was also remarkable in its sympathetic portrayal of jewish characters rebecca considered by many critics the books real heroine does not in the end get to marry ivanhoe whom she loves but scott allows her to remain faithful to her own religion rather than having her convert to christianity likewise her father isaac of york a jewish moneylender is shown as a victim rather than a villain in ivanhoe which is one of scotts waverley novels religious and sectarian fanatics are the villains while the eponymous hero is a bystander who must weigh the evidence and decide where to take a stand scotts positive portrayal of judaism which reflects his humanity and concern for religious toleration also coincided with a contemporary movement for the emancipation of the jews in england recovery of the crown jewels baronetcy and ceremonial pageantryedit rediscovering the lost honours of scotland in  george iv landing at leith in  scotts fame grew as his explorations and interpretations of scottish history and society captured popular imagination impressed by this the prince regent the future george iv gave scott permission to conduct a search for the crown jewels honours of scotland during the years of the protectorate under cromwell the crown jewels had been hidden away but had subsequently been used to crown charles ii they were not used to crown subsequent monarchs but were regularly taken to sittings of parliament to represent the absent monarch until the act of union  thereafter the honours were stored in edinburgh castle but the large locked box in which they were stored was not opened for more than  years and stories circulated that they had been lost or removed in  scott and a small team of military men opened the box and unearthed the honours from the crown room in the depths of edinburgh castle a grateful prince regent granted scott the title of baronet and in march  he received the baronetcy in london becoming sir walter scott st baronet after georges accession to the throne the city council of edinburgh invited scott at the kings behest to stagemanage the  visit of king george iv to scotland with only three weeks for planning and execution scott created a spectacular and comprehensive pageant designed not only to impress the king but also in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised scots society he used the event to contribute to the drawing of a line under an old world that pitched his homeland into regular bouts of bloody strife he along with his production team mounted what in modern days could be termed a pr event in which the king was dressed in tartan and was greeted by his people many of whom were also dressed in similar tartan ceremonial dress this form of dress proscribed after the  rebellion against the english became one of the seminal potent and ubiquitous symbols of scottish identity in his novel kenilworth elizabeth i is welcomed to the castle of that name by means of an elaborate pageant the details of which scott was well qualified to itemize much of scotts autograph work shows an almost streamofconsciousness approach to writing he included little in the way of punctuation in his drafts leaving such details to the printers to supply he eventually acknowledged in  that he was the author of the waverley novels financial problems and deathedit sir walter scotts grave at dryburgh abbey in  a ukwide banking crisis resulted in the collapse of the ballantyne printing business of which scott was the only partner with a financial interest the companys debts of £ equivalent to £ in  caused his very public ruin rather than declare himself bankrupt or to accept any kind of financial support from his many supporters and admirers including the king himself he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and determined to write his way out of debt he kept up his prodigious output of fiction as well as producing a biography of napoleon bonaparte until  by then his health was failing but he nevertheless undertook a grand tour of europe and was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went he returned to scotland and in september  during the epidemic in scotland that year died of typhus at abbotsford the home he had designed and had built near melrose in the scottish borders his wife lady scott had died in  and was buried as an episcopalian two presbyterian ministers and one episcopalian officiated at his funeral scott died owing money but his novels continued to sell and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his death personal lifeedit scotts eldest son lt walter scott inherited his fathers estate and possessions he married jane jobson only daughter of william jobson of lochore died  and his wife rachel stuart died  on  february  scott srs lawyer from at least  was hay donaldson ws died  who was also agent to the duke of buccleuch scott was donaldsons proposer when he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh his distant cousin was the poet randall swingler abbotsfordedit abbotsford house tomb of walter scott in dryburgh abbey by henry fox talbot  when scott was a boy he sometimes travelled with his father from selkirk to melrose where some of his novels are set at a certain spot the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the battle of melrose  during the summers from  scott made his home at the large house of ashestiel on the south bank of the river tweed  miles  km north of selkirk when his lease on this property expired in  scott bought cartley hole farm downstream on the tweed nearer melrose the farm had the nickname of clarty hole and when scott built a family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions the farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace scott was a pioneer of the scottish baronial style of architecture therefore abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour trophies of the chase a library of more than  volumes fine furniture and still finer pictures panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the houseverification needed it is estimated that the building cost scott more than £ equivalent to £ in  more land was purchased until scott owned nearly  acres  km a roman road with a ford near melrose used in olden days by the abbots of melrose suggested the name of abbotsford scott was buried in dryburgh abbey where his wife had earlier been interred nearby is a large statue of william

reputation declined in the last half of the th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism and scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children this trend accelerated in the th century for example in his classic study aspects of the novel  e m forster harshly criticized scotts clumsy and slapdash writing style flat characters and thin plots in contrast the novels of scotts contemporary jane austen once appreciated only by the discerning few including as it happened sir walter scott himself rose steadily in critical esteem though austen as a female writer was still faulted for her narrow feminine choice of subject matter which unlike scott avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine nevertheless scotts importance as an innovator continued to be recognized he was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel which others trace to jane porter whose work in the genre predates scotts and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in britain and on the european continent in the cultural sphere scotts waverley novels played a significant part in the movement begun with james macphersons ossian cycle in rehabilitating the public perception of the scottish highlands and its culture which had been formally suppressed as barbaric and viewed in the southern mind as a breeding ground of hill bandits religious fanaticism and jacobite rebellions scott served as chairman of the royal society of edinburgh and was also a member of the royal celtic society his own contribution to the reinvention of scottish culture was enormous even though his recreations of the customs of the highlands were fanciful at times despite his extensive travels around his native country it is a testament to scotts contribution in creating a unified identity for scotland that edinburghs central railway station opened in  by the north british railway is called waverley the fact that scott was a lowland presbyterian rather than a gaelicspeaking catholic highlander made him more acceptable to a conservative english reading public scotts novels were certainly influential in the making of the victorian craze for all things scottish among british royalty who were anxious to claim legitimacy through their rather attenuated historical connection with the royal house of stuartcitation needed at the time scott wrote scotland was poised to move away from an era of socially divisive clan warfare to a modern world of literacy and industrial capitalism through the medium of scotts novels the violent religious and political conflicts of the countrys recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which scott defined as the subtitle of waverley tis sixty years since indicates as something that happened at least  years ago scotts advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong though unspoken contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative english speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the french style on british soil scotts orchestration of king george ivs visit to scotland in  was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that in his view accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasimedieval bloodletting to be put to rest while envisioning a more useful peaceful future after scotts work had been essentially unstudied for many decades a revival of critical interest began from the s postmodern tastes favoured discontinuous narratives and the introduction of the first person yet they were more favourable to scotts work than modernist tastes while f r leavis had disdained scott seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence the great tradition  györgy lukács the historical novel  trans  and david daiches scotts achievement as a novelist  offered a marxian political reading of scotts fiction that generated a great deal of genuine interest in his work scott is now seen as an important innovator and a key figure in the development of scottish and world literature and particularly as the inventor of the historical novel memorials and commemorationedit the scott monument on edinburghs princes street statue by sir john steell on the scott monument in edinburgh scott monument in glasgows george square statue on the glasgow monument during his lifetime scotts portrait was painted by sir edwin landseer and fellowscots sir henry raeburn and james eckford lauder in edinburgh the metretall victorian gothic spire of the scott monument was designed by george meikle kemp it was completed in   years after scotts death and dominates the south side of princes street scott is also commemorated on a stone slab in makars court outside the writers museum lawnmarket edinburgh along with other prominent scottish writers quotes from his work are also visible on the canongate wall of the scottish parliament building in holyrood there is a tower dedicated to his memory on corstorphine hill in the west of the city and as mentioned edinburghs waverley railway station takes its name from one of his novels in glasgow walter scotts monument dominates the centre of george square the main public square in the city designed by david rhind in  the monument

walter scott no perth australia and lodge waverly no edinburgh scotland the annual walter scott prize for historical fiction was created in  by the duke and duchess of buccleuch whose ancestors were closely linked to sir walter scott at £ it is one of the largest prizes in british literature the award has been presented at scotts historic home abbotsford house scott has been credited with rescuing the scottish banknote in  there was outrage in scotland at the attempt of parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds scott wrote a series of letters to the edinburgh weekly journal under the pseudonym malachi malagrowther for retaining the right of scottish banks to issue their own banknotes this provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the scottish banks to continue printing pound notes this campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the bank of scotland the image on the  series of banknotes is based on the portrait by henry raeburn during and immediately after world war i there was a movement spearheaded by president wilson and other eminent people to inculcate patriotism in american school children especially immigrants and to stress the american connection with the literature and institutions of the mother country of great britain using selected readings in middle school textbooks scotts ivanhoe continued to be required reading for many american high school students until the end of the s a bust of scott is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling literature by other authorsedit in charles baudelaires la fanfarlo  poet samuel cramer says of scott oh that tedious author a dusty exhumer of chronicles a fastidious mass of descriptions of bricabrac  and castoff things of every sort armor tableware furniture gothic inns and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about dressed in leotards in the novella however cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of scotts novels in anne brontës the tenant of wildfell hall  the narrator gilbert markham brings an elegantly bound copy of marmion as a present to the independent tenant of wildfell hall helen graham whom he is courting and is mortified when she insists on paying for it in a speech delivered at salem massachusetts on  january  to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist john brown and his followers ralph waldo emerson calls brown an example of true chivalry which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that walter scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career in his  memoir army life in a black regiment new england abolitionist thomas wentworth higginson later editor of emily dickinson described how he wrote down and preserved negro spirituals or shouts while serving as a colonel in the first south carolina volunteers the first authorized union army regiment recruited from freedmen during the civil war memorialized in the  film glory he wrote that he was a faithful student of the scottish ballads and had always envied sir walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones according to his daughter eleanor scott was an author to whom karl marx again and again returned whom he admired and knew as well as he did balzac and fielding in his  life on the mississippi mark twain satirized the impact of scotts writings declaring with humorous hyperbole that scott had so large a hand in making southern character as it existed before the american civil war that he is in great measure responsible for the war he goes on to coin the term sir walter scott disease which he blames for the souths lack of advancement twain also targeted scott in adventures of huckleberry finn where he names a sinking boat the walter scott  and in a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court  the main character repeatedly utters great scott as an oath by the end of the book however he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armor reflecting twains ambivalence on the topic the idyllic cape cod retreat of suffragists verena tarrant and olive chancellor in henry james the bostonians  is called marmion evoking what james considered the quixotic idealism of these social reformers in to the lighthouse by virginia woolf mrs ramsey glances at her husband he was reading something that moved him very much  he was tossing the pages over he was acting it – perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book she wondered what book it was oh it was one of old sir walter’s she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above that people don’t read scott any more then her husband thought “that’s what they’ll say of me” so he went and got one of those books  scotts feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit’s cottage in the antiquary made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears  it fortified him he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening  and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn’t exist at all raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott’s hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie’s drowning and mucklebackit’s sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him well let them improve upon that he thought as he finished the chapter  the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman he thought returning to scott and balzac to the

named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions in  scott was offered the position of poet laureate he declined due to concerns that such an appointment would be a poisoned chalice as the laureateship had fallen into disrepute due to the decline in quality of work suffered by previous title holders  as a succession of poetasters had churned out conventional and obsequious odes on royal occasions he sought advice from the duke of buccleuch who counseled him to retain his literary independence and the position went to scotts friend robert southey novelismedit a legend of montrose illustration from the  edition although scott had attained worldwide celebrity through his poetry he soon tried his hand at documenting his researches into the oral tradition of the scottish borders in prose fiction—stories and novels—at the time still considered aesthetically inferior to poetry above all to such classical genres as the epic or poetic tragedy as a mimetic vehicle for portraying historical events in an innovative and astute action he wrote and published his first novel waverley anonymously in  it was a tale of the jacobite rising of  its english protagonist edward waverley like don quixote a great reader of romances has been brought up by his tory uncle who is sympathetic to jacobitism although edwards own father is a whig the youthful waverley obtains a commission in the whig army and is posted in dundee on leave he meets his uncles friend the jacobite baron bradwardine and is attracted to the barons daughter rose on a visit to the highlands edward overstays his leave and is arrested and charged with desertion but is rescued by the highland chieftain fergus macivor and his mesmerizing sister flora whose devotion to the stuart cause as it exceeded her brothers in fanaticism excelled it also in purity through flora waverley meets bonnie prince charlie and under her influence goes over to the jacobite side and takes part in the battle of prestonpans he escapes retribution however after saving the life of a whig colonel during the battle waverley whose surname reflects his divided loyalties eventually decides to lead a peaceful life of establishment respectability under the house of hanover rather than live as a proscribed rebel he chooses to marry the beautiful rose bradwardine rather than cast his lot with the sublime flora macivor who after the failure of the  rising retires to a french convent there followed a succession of novels over the next five years each with a scottish historical setting mindful of his reputation as a poet scott maintained the anonymity he had begun with waverley publishing the novels under the name author of waverley or as tales of with no author among those familiar with his poetry his identity became an open secret but scott persisted in maintaining the façade perhaps because he thought his oldfashioned father would disapprove of his engaging in such a trivial pursuit as novel writing during this time scott became known by the nickname the wizard of the north in  he was given the honour of dining with george prince regent who wanted to meet the author of waverley edgar and lucie at mermaidens well by charles robert leslie  after sir walter scotts bride of lammermoor lucie is wearing a full plaid scotts  series tales of my landlord is sometimes considered a subset of the waverley novels and was intended to illustrate aspects of scottish regional life among the best known is the bride of lammermoor a fictionalized version of an actual incident in the history of the dalrymple family that took place in the lammermuir hills in  in the novel lucie ashton and the nobly born but now dispossessed and impoverished edgar ravenswood exchange vows but the ravenswoods and the wealthy ashtons who now own the former ravenswood lands are enemies and lucies mother forces her daughter to break her engagement to edgar and marry the wealthy sir arthur bucklaw lucie falls into a depression and on their wedding night stabs the bridegroom succumbs to insanity and dies in  french romantic painter eugène delacroix painted a portrait depicting himself as the melancholy disinherited edgar ravenswood the prolonged climactic coloratura mad scene for lucia in donizettis  bel canto opera lucia di lammermoor is based on what in the novel were just a few bland sentences tales of my landlord includes the now highly regarded novel old mortality set in – against the backdrop of the ferocious anticovenanting campaign of the tory graham of claverhouse subsequently made viscount dundee called bluidy clavers by his opponents but later dubbed bonnie dundee by scott the covenanters were presbyterians who had supported the restoration of charles ii on promises of a presbyterian settlement but he had instead reintroduced episcopalian church government with draconian penalties for presbyterian worship this led to the destitution of around  ministers who had refused to take an oath of allegiance and submit themselves to bishops and who continued to conduct worship among a remnant of their flock in caves and other remote country spots the relentless persecution of these conventicles and attempts to break them up by military force had led to open revolt the story is told from the point of view of henry morton a moderate presbyterian who is unwittingly drawn into the conflict and barely escapes summary execution in writing old mortality scott drew upon the knowledge he had acquired from his researches into ballads on the subject for the minstrelsy of the scottish border scotts background as a lawyer also informed his perspective for at the time of the novel which takes place before the act of union of  english law did not apply in scotland and afterwards scotland has continued to have its own scots law as a hybrid legal system a recent critic who is a legal as well as a literary scholar argues that old mortality not only reflects the dispute between stuarts absolute monarchy and the jurisdiction of the courts but also invokes a foundational moment in british sovereignty namely the habeas corpus act also known as the great writ passed by the english parliament in  oblique reference to the origin of habeas corpus underlies scotts next novel ivanhoe set during the era of the creation of the magna carta which political conservatives like walter scott and edmund burke regarded as rooted in immemorial british custom and precedent ivanhoe  set in thcentury england marked a move away from scotts focus on the local history of scotland based partly on humes history of england and the ballad cycle of robin hood ivanhoe was quickly translated into many languages and inspired countless imitations and theatrical adaptations ivanhoe depicts the cruel tyranny of the norman overlords norman yoke over the impoverished saxon populace of england with two of the main characters rowena and locksley robin hood representing the dispossessed saxon aristocracy when the protagonists are captured and imprisoned by a norman baron scott interrupts the story to exclaim it is grievous to think that those valiant barons to whose stand against the crown the liberties of england were indebted for their existence should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of england but to those of nature and humanity but alas fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period chapter  the institution of the magna carta which happens outside the time frame of the story is portrayed as a progressive incremental reform but also as a step towards the recovery of a lost golden age of liberty endemic to england and the english system scott puts a derisive prophecy in the mouth of the jester wamba norman saw on english oak on english neck a norman yoke norman spoon to english dish and england ruled as normans wish blithe world in england never will be more till englands rid of all the four ivanhoe ch xxvii although on the surface an entertaining escapist romance alert contemporary readers would have quickly recognised the political subtext of ivanhoe which appeared immediately after the english parliament fearful of frenchstyle revolution in the aftermath of waterloo had passed the habeas corpus suspension acts of  and  and other extremely repressive measures and when traditional english charter rights versus revolutionary human rights was a topic of discussion ivanhoe was also remarkable in its sympathetic portrayal of jewish characters rebecca considered by many critics the books real heroine does not in the end get to marry ivanhoe whom she loves but scott allows her to remain faithful to her own religion rather than having her convert to christianity likewise her father isaac of york a jewish moneylender is shown as a victim rather than a villain in ivanhoe which is one of scotts waverley novels religious and sectarian fanatics are the villains while the eponymous hero is a bystander who must weigh the evidence and decide where to take a stand scotts positive portrayal of judaism which reflects his humanity and concern for religious toleration also coincided with a contemporary movement for the emancipation of the jews in england recovery of the crown jewels baronetcy and ceremonial pageantryedit rediscovering the lost honours of scotland in  george iv landing at leith in  scotts fame grew as his explorations and interpretations of scottish history and society captured popular imagination impressed by this the prince regent the future george iv gave scott permission to conduct a search for the crown jewels honours of scotland during the years of the protectorate under cromwell the crown jewels had been hidden away but had subsequently been used to crown charles ii they were not used to crown subsequent monarchs but were regularly taken to sittings of parliament to represent the absent monarch until the act of union  thereafter the honours were stored in edinburgh castle but the large locked box in which they were stored was not opened for more than  years and stories circulated that they had been lost or removed in  scott and a small team of military men opened the box and unearthed the honours from the crown room in the depths of edinburgh castle a grateful prince regent granted scott the title of baronet and in march  he received the baronetcy in london becoming sir walter scott st baronet after georges accession to the throne the city council of edinburgh invited scott at the kings behest to stagemanage the  visit of king george iv to scotland with only three weeks for planning and execution scott created a spectacular and comprehensive pageant designed not only to impress the king but also in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised scots society he used the event to contribute to the drawing of a line under an old world that pitched his homeland into regular bouts of bloody strife he along with his production team mounted what in modern days could be termed a pr event in which the king was dressed in tartan and was greeted by his people many of whom were also dressed in similar tartan ceremonial dress this form of dress proscribed after the  rebellion against the english became one of the seminal potent and ubiquitous symbols of scottish identity in his novel kenilworth elizabeth i is welcomed to the castle of that name by means of an elaborate pageant the details of which scott was well qualified to itemize much of scotts autograph work shows an almost streamofconsciousness approach to writing he included little in the way of punctuation in his drafts leaving such details to the printers to supply he eventually acknowledged in  that he was the author of the waverley novels financial problems and deathedit sir walter scotts grave at dryburgh abbey in  a ukwide banking crisis resulted in the collapse of the ballantyne printing business of which scott was the only partner with a financial interest the companys debts of £ equivalent to £ in  caused his very public ruin rather than declare himself bankrupt or to accept any kind of financial support from his many supporters and admirers including the king himself he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and determined to write his way out of debt he kept up his prodigious output of fiction as well as producing a biography of napoleon bonaparte until  by then his health was failing but he nevertheless undertook a grand tour of europe and was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went he returned to scotland and in september  during the epidemic in scotland that year died of typhus at abbotsford the home he had designed and had built near melrose in the scottish borders his wife lady scott had died in  and was buried as an episcopalian two presbyterian ministers and one episcopalian officiated at his funeral scott died owing money but his novels continued to sell and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his death personal lifeedit scotts eldest son lt walter scott inherited his fathers estate and possessions he married jane jobson only daughter of william jobson of lochore died  and his wife rachel stuart died  on  february  scott srs lawyer from at least  was hay donaldson ws died  who was also agent to the duke of buccleuch scott was donaldsons proposer when he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh his distant cousin was the poet randall swingler abbotsfordedit abbotsford house tomb of walter scott in dryburgh abbey by henry fox talbot  when scott was a boy he sometimes travelled with his father from selkirk to melrose where some of his novels are set at a certain spot the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the battle of melrose  during the summers from  scott made his home at the large house of ashestiel on the south bank of the river tweed  miles  km north of selkirk when his lease on this property expired in  scott bought cartley hole farm downstream on the tweed nearer melrose the farm had the nickname of clarty hole and when scott built a family cottage there in  he named it abbotsford he continued to expand the estate and built abbotsford house in a series of extensions the farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace scott was a pioneer of the scottish baronial style of architecture therefore abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour trophies of the chase a library of more than  volumes fine furniture and still finer pictures panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the houseverification needed it is estimated that the building cost scott more than £ equivalent to £ in  more land was purchased until scott owned nearly  acres  km a roman road with a ford near melrose used in olden days by the abbots of melrose suggested the name of abbotsford scott was buried in dryburgh abbey where his wife had earlier been interred nearby is a large statue of william wallace one of scotlands many

corporatism tory socialism pink tory ultratories v t e later assessmentedit although he continued to be extremely popular and widely read both at home and abroad scotts critical reputation declined in the last half of the th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism and scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children this trend accelerated in the th century for example in his classic study aspects of the novel  e m forster harshly criticized scotts clumsy and slapdash writing style flat characters and thin plots in contrast the novels of scotts contemporary jane austen once appreciated only by the discerning few including as it happened sir walter scott himself rose steadily in critical esteem though austen as a female writer was still faulted for her narrow feminine choice of subject matter which unlike scott avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine nevertheless scotts importance as an innovator continued to be recognized he was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel which others trace to jane porter whose work in the genre predates scotts and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in britain and on the european continent in the cultural sphere scotts waverley novels played a significant part in the movement begun with james macphersons ossian cycle in rehabilitating the public perception of the scottish highlands and its culture which had been formally suppressed as barbaric and viewed in the southern mind as a breeding ground of hill bandits religious fanaticism and jacobite rebellions scott served as chairman of the royal society of edinburgh and was also a member of the royal celtic society his own contribution to the reinvention of scottish culture was enormous even though his recreations of the customs of the highlands were fanciful at times despite his extensive travels around his native country it is a testament to scotts contribution in creating a unified identity for scotland that edinburghs central railway station opened in  by the north british railway is called waverley the fact that scott was a lowland presbyterian rather than a gaelicspeaking catholic highlander made him more acceptable to a conservative english reading public scotts novels were certainly influential in the making of the victorian craze for all things scottish among british royalty who were anxious to claim legitimacy through their rather attenuated historical connection with the royal house of stuartcitation needed at the time scott wrote scotland was poised to move away from an era of socially divisive clan warfare to a modern world of literacy and industrial capitalism through the medium of scotts novels the violent religious and political conflicts of the countrys recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which scott defined as the subtitle of waverley tis sixty years since indicates as something that happened at least  years ago scotts advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong though unspoken contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative english speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the french style on british soil scotts orchestration of king george ivs visit to scotland in  was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that in his view accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasimedieval bloodletting to be put to rest while envisioning a more useful peaceful future after scotts work had been essentially unstudied for many decades a revival of critical interest began from the s postmodern tastes favoured discontinuous narratives and the introduction of the first person yet they were more favourable to scotts work than modernist tastes while f r leavis had disdained scott seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence the great tradition  györgy lukács the historical novel  trans  and david daiches scotts achievement as a novelist  offered a marxian political reading of scotts fiction that generated a great deal of genuine interest in his work scott is now seen as an important innovator and a key figure in the development of scottish and world literature and particularly as the inventor of the historical novel memorials and commemorationedit the scott monument on edinburghs princes street statue by sir john steell on the scott monument in edinburgh scott monument in glasgows

outrage in scotland at the attempt of parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds scott wrote a series of letters to the edinburgh weekly journal under the pseudonym malachi malagrowther for retaining the right of scottish banks to issue their own banknotes this provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the scottish banks to continue printing pound notes this campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the bank of scotland the image on the  series of banknotes is based on the portrait by henry raeburn during and immediately after world war i there was a movement spearheaded by president wilson and other eminent people to inculcate patriotism in american school children especially immigrants and to stress the american connection with the literature and institutions of the mother country of great britain using selected readings in middle school textbooks scotts ivanhoe continued to be required reading for many american high school students until the end of the s a bust of scott is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling literature by other authorsedit in charles baudelaires la fanfarlo  poet samuel cramer says of scott oh that tedious author a dusty exhumer of chronicles a fastidious mass of descriptions of bricabrac  and castoff things of every sort armor tableware furniture gothic inns and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about dressed in leotards in the novella however cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of scotts novels in anne brontës the tenant of wildfell hall  the narrator gilbert markham brings an elegantly bound copy of marmion as a present to the independent tenant of wildfell hall helen graham whom he is courting and is mortified when she insists on paying for it in a speech delivered at salem massachusetts on  january  to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist john brown and his followers ralph waldo emerson calls brown an example of true chivalry which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that walter scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career in his  memoir army life in a black regiment new england abolitionist thomas wentworth higginson later editor of emily dickinson described how he wrote down and preserved negro spirituals or shouts while serving as a colonel in the first south carolina volunteers the first authorized union army regiment recruited from freedmen during the civil war memorialized in the  film glory he wrote that he was a faithful student of the scottish ballads and had always envied sir walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones according to his daughter eleanor scott was an author to whom karl marx again and again returned whom he admired and knew as well as he did balzac and fielding in his  life on the mississippi mark twain satirized the impact of scotts writings declaring with humorous hyperbole that scott had so large a hand in making southern character as it existed before the american civil war that he is in great measure responsible for the war he goes on to coin the term sir walter scott disease which he blames for the souths lack of advancement twain also targeted scott in adventures of huckleberry finn where he names a sinking boat the walter scott  and in a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court  the main character repeatedly utters great scott as an oath by the end of the book however he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armor reflecting twains ambivalence on the topic the idyllic cape cod retreat of suffragists verena tarrant and olive chancellor in henry james the bostonians  is called marmion evoking what james considered the quixotic idealism of these social reformers in to the lighthouse by virginia woolf mrs ramsey glances at her husband he was reading something that moved him very much  he was tossing the pages over he was acting it – perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book she wondered what book it was oh it was one of old sir walter’s she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above that people don’t read scott any more then her husband thought “that’s what they’ll say of me” so he went and got one of those books  scotts feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit’s cottage in the antiquary made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears  it fortified him he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening  and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn’t exist at all raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott’s hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie’s drowning and mucklebackit’s sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him well let them improve upon that he thought as he finished the chapter  the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman he thought returning to scott and balzac to the english novel and the french novel in  sciencefiction author isaac asimov wrote breeds there a man a short story with a title alluding vividly to scotts the lay of the last minstrel  in to kill a mockingbird  the

given way to a crown policy of seizing and imprisoning opponents without recourse to the courts in  this policy of using extrajudicial imprisonments to quell rebellion ﬁnally provoked the english parliament to pass the act of habeas corpus in england usually translated as “produce the body” habeas corpus could be invoked by any subject to require that the king or his agents produce the body of a prisoner for adjudication before the courts in its barest terms the great writ protected a subject from indeﬁnite terms of imprisonment from imprisonment outside the kingdom or from imprisonment without cause it did so by asserting the jurisdiction of the courts as superior to the executive powers of the king the act was thus part of a long debate within the three kingdoms about the relationship of king to law and vice versa  witherbee  pp – habeas corpus had been suspended in the mids at the time of the french revolution by william pitt who had called the french declaration of human rights monstrous widely publicised trials for sedition took place in edinburgh  and in london  john thelwall and two others were charged with treason the scottish defendants received harsh sentences whereas the english ones were acquitted according to historian anne stott the difference between the english and scottish trials reflects the different legal systems ironically the

full of exciting events and this radical abridgement serves its purpose well it also manages to convey the emotional import of ivanhoe rather well there is more emotional complexity here than you

saturday i won’t deny that i knew the magnitude of this and i even thought about erasing the video santana said in an interview on msnbc’s all in with chris hayes wednesday i felt that my life with this information might be in danger i thought about erasing the video and just getting out of the community you know charleston and living some place else the yearold said i knew the cop didnt do the right thing in an interview with todays matt lauer on thursday santana said im still scared i say life changed in a matter of seconds i never thought this would happen that i would be a witness he told todays matt lauer in an exclusive interview thursday im still scared earlier wednesday santana revealed himself as the videographer to nbc nightly news anchor lester holt in his first interview since the shooting and said slager and scott did struggle before the encounter turned deadly but he said the officer did not appear to be in danger when he opened fire before i started recording they were down on the floor i remember the police officer had control of the situation santana said he had control of scott and scott was trying just to get away from the taser but like i said he never

were saying santana said on msnbc i said no  this is not what happened santana told nbc news that when he turned over the video to scotts family they were very emotional when that happened including me also i thought about his position their situation  if i were to have a family member that would happen to i would like to know the truth santana said he has been called a hero by attorneys for the
