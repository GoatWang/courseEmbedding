funds shares will not be listed on an exchange in the foreseeable future if at all it is not anticipated that a secondary market for the shares will develop unless the shares are listed on an exchange thus an investment in the fund is not suitable for investors who might need access to the money they invest for several years or longer the fund may decline to accept any subscription requests for any reason regardless of the order in which such subscription request was submitted to the fund in a particular subscription period if a borrower is unable to make its payments on a loan the fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal and interest under such loan as among other reasons the fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated the loan may be unsecured or undercollateralized andor it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower the marketplace lending instruments in which the fund may invest will not typically be guaranteed or insured by any thirdparty and will not typically be backed by any governmental authority prospective borrowers supply a variety of information regarding the purpose of the loan income occupation and employment status as applicable to the lending platforms as a general matter platforms do not verify the majority of this information which may be incomplete inaccurate false or misleading prospective borrowers may misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms including their intentions for the use of the loan proceeds marketplace lending instruments are generally not rated by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros such unrated instruments may be comparable in quality to securities falling into any of the ratings categories used by such nrsros accordingly certain of the funds unrated investments could constitute a highly risky and speculative investment similar to an investment in junk bonds the marketplace lending instruments in which the fund may invest may have varying degrees of credit risk and the fund will not be restricted by any borrower credit criteria or credit risk limitation there can be no assurance that payments due on underlying marketplace loans will be made at any given time the funds portfolio may be substantially illiquid and subject to increased credit and default risk the shares therefore should be purchased only by investors who could afford the loss of the entire amount of their investment the companys fees and expenses may be considered high and as a result such fees and expenses may offset the companys profits a portion of the investments executed for the company may take place in foreign markets as a result of the foregoing and other risks described in this prospectus an investment in the fund is considered to be highly speculative diversification does not ensure a profit or a guarantee against loss  the fund is classified as nondiversified which means the fund may invest a larger percentage of its assets in the securities of a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund investment in securities of a limited number of issuers exposes the fund to greater market risk and potential losses than if its assets were diversified among the securities of a greater number of issuers  duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed income

allocation by setting a pattern of rebalancing you become accustomed to taking profits from winners and adding to losers this process has the added benefit of helping to remove emotion and avoid the temptation to chase performance or shy away from value control taxes  minimizing taxes is an important part of an overall investing strategy for any investor with securities in a taxable account

articles fast approvals helping speed up business    experiencing a growing appetite among the business community for expansion first trust bank recently announced a market first in northern ireland targeting both new and existing customers they have given a commitment to make decisions on new business loans and overdraft requests up to £ within  hours   one company that has already availed of this quick access to finance is bespoke joinery business co down based lignum interiors   speaking about the service ciaran mcmenamin one of the founders of lignum interiors said  having a secure cash flow is particularly important in the construction industry and for exporters like us who are often dealing with fluctuating markets and a variety of suppliers and contractors as a relatively new customer to the bank they took the time to get to know us and our business and this quick access to finance is helping us grow our operations we have just completed two highend bar outfits in america and are looking to new markets like dubai building on our existing middle east experience    donna armstrong first trust bank added lignum interiors is one of northern ireland’s best sme exporters – a fact recently highlighted when they were commended in the business eye first trust bank small business awards their reputation for bespoke interiors and furniture is attracting a global following so we are delighted to continue to support them and their ambitious growth plans local butchers a ‘cut above the rest’ following significant investment from a workforce of three in  family owned cunningham butchers has grown to employ  members of staff  kilkeel firm has over  different products with all produce sourced from the family’s farm or purchased from local farmers and suppliers     one of co down’s longest established businesses cunningham butchers – who will soon be celebrating its th anniversary operating in the town of kilkeel  has created  new jobs following a significant investment in its premises    with the support of first trust bank cunningham butchers has opened a new bistro fresh food hall and renovated its multiaward winning butchery the butchers is one of only a handful of northern ireland stores that boasts a himalayan salt chamber for dryageing beef with this expansion the shop now also provides customers with fresh produce from a deli hot food counter and bakery and also makes its own homemade gelato icecream   experiencing year on year growth for the last six years cunningham butchers had three staff members in  and with this latest investment now employs over  people the family run business produces over  different product lines including extra lean and gluten free varieties and supplies its range to local retailers including eurospar   speaking about its recent investment and expansion james cunningham jnr the fourth generation of his family to run the business said   “northern ireland’s agrifood industry is thriving and this is partly down to the innovative mindset of local food businesses that are ready to jump to the challenge and modernise their operations in response to market demands our own expansion meets a growing need for products that don’t compromise on taste or quality including those of health conscious consumers thankfully our reputation for preparing food in a traditional way but with a modern twist has grown over the years we’re delighted to open our expanded premises with the support of first trust bank and broaden our range where now people can purchase everything from a dry aged steak to low fat and gluten free ready meals with the addition of our bistro we are now offering customers a restaurant that supplies itself from start to finish providing customers with one of the freshest dining experiences possible found only in a handful of places anywhere in ireland”   welcoming news of the expansion kevin fitzpatrick kilkeel business manager first trust bank said   “key to the success of cunningham butchers has been their unwavering commitment to high quality food that also meets customer’s expectations for choice value and convenience as well as growing their own business the firm is helping boost business around the wider co down area through job creation and local supply opportunities with indepth experience and knowledge handed down through generations james cunningham jnr and his father james snr came to us with a wellthought out business idea that demonstrated market foresight and ambition we are delighted to support their expansion plans and are confident that their ability to mix heritage and tradition with innovation will serve them well as they continue to grow” despite a busy marketplace cormac diamond established bloc blinds in  after spotting the need for a simple interchangeable roller blind system   now designing and manufacturing a host of shading products bloc blinds recently announced a £ million expansion at its premises in magherafelt which will create  new jobs and allow the firm to respond to export demand   “to be a good exporter you need a good team from sales executives to marketing and production staff a talented team of people all embracing a company’s ambition counts for a lot patience is also an attribute businesses need to have when looking to export it takes time to establish and build relationships with foreign partners the key is not to be disheartened and to take on board feedback where you can some products that we thought would perform well abroad received mixed responses but this allowed us to go back to the drawing board and adapt and amend our offering to ensure new markets were receiving exactly what they needed    has been a year of change for bloc blinds we have been settling in to our new purpose built facilities and have welcomed new employees to the firm – bringing our workforce up to  people with more set to join over the coming years it’s an exciting time for the business as we continue with our innovative product development that initially helped put the company on the map   the blind market is a saturated one our unique selling point is that customers can change the fabric of their blind whenever they want and this has really resonated with consumers so much so that we successfully introduced seasonal fabric for special occasions such as christmas  our products are also suited to the novice diyer as our blinds come with drill free brackets innovation and rd are hugely important elements of our business currently we have  product patents pending four patents that have been confirmed and we are gearing up to launch two truly game changing products later this year one of these – a unique solar powered skylight – will be particularly suited to our export markets while the other a cordless blind responds to a real need for shading products that also ensure child safety   as well as exporting across the uk and roi – we export to further afield in europe including holland france and germany and plan to grow our export potential further over the coming years in line with our expansion plans there are many benefits that come with being an exporter firstly you spread your risk and are better able to navigate market fluctuations if you are operating across a few different markets  exporting also helps you lift the performance of your business to a higher level if you are sending product further away you are going to make sure it’s fit for purpose to minimise any follow up and you find that this attitude results in better performance right across the board   northern ireland is a great place to export from organisations like investni are dedicated to supporting export potential here and helped us by facilitating meetings and trade visits which have directly led to orders we’re uniquely placed too with a ‘double hop’ export market open to us – into roi and the gb market  an issue that is always on the mind of exporters is how product flows and how trade relations are sustained otherwise though a key selling point ni businesses having going for them is our talented people as a region we have a great pool of educated and committed professionals on our doorstep knowing how key our team has been to bloc blinds i can’t emphasise the importance of this enough while we are an exporting company we also work with a host of local companies who support that drive from our bank first trust bank who have believed in our vision to a host of fabric designers and aluminium suppliers who ensure we remain innovative and competitive this has shown us the breadth of talented businesses and people which exist in northern ireland and proves we can compete with the best in the world from its base on the east coast of co down ardglass sea products ltd exports fresh and frozen fish products all over the world as well as supplying local restaurants businesses and wholesalers across ni through its successful retail division  a family run business the company was established by brothers seamus and philip milligan and is now run by seamus’ son david milligan    it seems obvious but in order to be a successful exporter you must have a deep understanding of the markets you are operating in or plan to operate in cultural and societal factors are important as are logistics issues such as currency payment and import structures by understanding the nuances of each market you can build a tailored and effective operating model ardglass sea products starting exporting almost  years ago while my father and uncle may not have envisaged us exporting to locations as far afield as cameroon they recognised the opportunity to penetrate emerging markets brought about by increased globalisation as a result we now have a wide client base across the eu africa and asia as well as experience in the russian market at ardglass we sell pelagic fish often referred to as the ‘chicken of the sea’ it’s known for its high protein value and low cost we can bring our catch in from the irish sea to our wellequipped factory and within hours the produce can be exported to our customers it’s a product that is in high demand by consumers but  has been a tricky year for the fishing industry as a whole with the sector suffering from poor sales in europe and a lack of exportable currency in africa usd   these market and sectoral fluctuations make product quality and customer experience all the more important we maintain a close understanding of our customers’ ever changing needs this helps us implement changes which benefit our clients and our business and allows us to add value to our products through good communication and excellent service we pride ourselves on these relationships and building trust and reputation with your clients can be just as important as knowing your export market  this is why despite increased competition we have been doing business with some of our customers for nearly  years   geographically speaking northern ireland is an excellent base for exporters we benefit from good shipping links from dublin  a particularly crucial factor for our business  and as a region we are focused on growing our economy  this means that organisations and local authorities as we found in our dealing with invest ni and department of agriculture and rural development are very supportive in helping you achieve your ambition being an exporter also allows you to continue to grow your business by working across a number of regions you aren’t wholly reliant on one economy or one market but instead can scope out additional opportunities if a particular marketplace goes into decline or stagnates   challenges do of course exist in our business we have found that some aspects of ni infrastructure have prohibited our growth plans recently we experienced difficulty in securing adequate electricity supply to power our facilities and setbacks of this type can adversely affect businesses growth ambitions we have been committed to modernising our operations over the last number of years and at the start of  we completed a large expansion project which modernised our freezing and cold storage capabilities having completed this part of our growth programme we are now looking forward to installing new processing equipment which will further improve our efficiency and outputs and allow us to reach new customers   as with other many other businesses operating within the agrifood sector ‘brexit’ is a hot topic for fishing companies it’s of particular relevance given the stringent quotas placed on the industry this has been restrictive to our growth plans so we will continue to observe the debate and vote with interest the deluxe group’s managing director colm o’farrell is currently in dubai leading the company’s dubai office  deluxe theme turnkey projects  which opened in december     headquartered in portadown the deluxe group started out as painting and decorating firm in  but evolved its service offering in line with changing markets and is now probably best known as a bespoke joinery manufacturer and theming company    my advice to anyone considering exporting is to make sure that your offering is original diversifying your operations opens your business up to a host of niche opportunities whereas going in to a new market with price as your differentiator can lead to tough challenges as you deal with competitors and fluctuations in overheads and demand   the deluxe group is now mainly an exporting company although the ni and roi market is currently quiet for us we export to a host of european countries including england france the netherlands and further afield to the uae where there is a huge demand for our theming specialism we very much see ourselves as an international company  open to exporting anywhere and everywhere   the company’s current activity spans high end joinery in the luxury hospitality and residential sector in london to creative fabrication for theme park attractions in dubai where they have just opened an office following the award of five themed attractions at motiongate dubai’s largest movie based theme park opening later this year   i think the evolution of our business the emphasis we put on quality and talent coupled with our attention to detail  both in our products and business decisions – helps to explain our export success  our offering has continually developed to respond to gaps in the market moving from painting and decorating in the s and s to specialist finishes in the s to bespoke joinery and outfitting in the s  we saw a huge upturn in business from  onwards and almost vertical growth last year as our theming division expanded     one element of our business that attracts attention and contributes to our growing reputation is our ability to offer end to end service delivery as well as creating the sets props and special effects for attractions such as hotel transylvania ghostbusters zombieland the green hornet and underworld at motiongate in dubai we manage the entire artistic process and commit to delivering projects on time and to budget     the joiners who work at deluxe are learning a new way of doing carpentry key to our success is our talented workforce so we invest in factory and inhouse training – equipping our team with the skills they need to be master carpenters it’s a great environment to work in when people think of fitout or joinery they typically envisage furniture design but in our workshops you come face to face with all manner of builds from witches’ carts to gargoyles  by combining the latest in technological design and production equipment with woodworking craftsmanship and artistic talent we can create sets that make people feel as if they have been transported to a different world       got off to a phenomenal start for us and we have plenty in store for the rest of the year and beyond with orders lined up for the next  –  years we have one of the biggest supply packages for dubai parks and resorts where we are working to bring to life the five sony pictures attractions  we are making great inroads into the luxury fitout market in london working on private members hotels such as the devonshire club which is a growing trend in the london hospitality market   key to making sure exporting is the right – and a successful – option for your business is to avail of the great support networks available if it wasn’t for the support of invest ni the department of trade and industry and our bank first trust bank we wouldn’t be where we are today the invest ni team in dubai helped us team up with a local sponsor and have been a great support mechanism to help us navigate the local business industry in uae   looking to northern ireland i’m optimistic about our economic prospects as there is a sense of upturn both north and south of the border – despite the brexit question while daunting exporting doesn’t have to be difficult  we haven’t encountered any logistical problems and just recently transferred  containers to our new office in dubai with no issue as long as you are responding to a market demand and have something unique and original to offer exporting is a rewarding endeavour with a host of partners and organisations hoping to grow northern ireland’s export potential getting the support and knowledge you need has never been easier start of accordion engineering firm takes top award a belfast engineering business with a year old chief
