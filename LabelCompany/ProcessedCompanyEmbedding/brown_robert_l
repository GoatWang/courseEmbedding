wash out the chlorine with conventional commercially available shampoos rinses conditioners and the like however such products have proved to be largely ineffective for treating the chlorine problem a composition is therefore needed that can be safely and conveniently applied by an individual to his or her own hair and that will remove the chlorine from the hair leaving it manageable and soft
