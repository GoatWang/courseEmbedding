afternoon with that i will turn the call over to steve steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director thank you phil and thanks for investors and analysts for joining our third quarter earnings call it was a solid quarter for our company with several noteworthy milestones top line third quarter revenue growth was  versus the third quarter last year on a constant currency basis  translates to a beefy  growth in cardtronics revenues this represents our ninth consecutive quarter of doubledigit revenue growth the revenue growth yielded  adjusted ebitda growth it is worth noting that this is the th quarter out of the previous  that delivered doubledigit growth in this metric and management is pleased with the earnings leverage produced by these revenues which yielded a  adjusted eps growth rate this adjusted eps growth rate like adjusted ebitda above is also the th quarter out of the last  with doubledigit adjusted eps growth now most quarters have a particular number that highlights or exemplifies the strength of our business model that number for this quarter is our gross margin number which beat last years by  basis points at  we are at a record high in the history of the company since the company went public in late  our gross margin has steadily climbed from about  then to now over  the success of this margin expansion is a testament to several compelling attributes of our business model and our management team we have the power of scale which we demonstrate in multiple geographies we have a demonstrated history of executing smart accretive and synergistic acquisitions and we have a business that is durable with a respectable organic growth profile chris will elaborate on some of the drivers of this result in a few minutes but it was a combination of factors that drove this improvement and we saw a nice expansion in both north america and europe this is a solid proof point of my belief that cardtronics can drive meaningful margin improvement over the long term now certainly events such as acquisitions major investments in new markets compliance costs like emv or the loss of a key account can interrupt that journey but the underlying strength of our unique model will always push margins forward over the long term we are quite proud of our record and of the team that has produced these results year after year on a global basis we had a solid quarter of new atm installations over  atms were installed across our six country footprint about  were in europe with the balance in north america this brings our installation activity for the year to more than  units it is sometimes easy to lose track of what we are accomplishing dayin and dayout so let me offer some contextual perspective of our scope and scale those  atms installed in the past nine months are almost as many units as the second largest us bank has in total active branches and its more atms installed in just nine months than several top  banks have in total turning now to north america we had a productive third quarter for our branding services we were successful in selling atm branding deals on almost  new sites we expanded our relationship with tcf bank to brand target stores across the upper midwest and im very pleased to report an exciting new relationship with capital one who installed branded atms with full function deposittaking capabilities throughout target stores in massachusetts our allpoint growth continues at a solid pace in  with two dozen new financial institutions signing on to the allpoint network in the third quarter representing nearly  new cardholders that will have surchargefree access to thousands of our atms this includes two new top  credit unions giving us direct allpoint relationships with  out of the top  credit unions in the country and these two dozen new sales were matched by execution of our conversion backlog of a similar number this quarter we added  new atm units to our conversion backlog yeartodate that gives us a very respectable  atm units sold now moving to renewal updates im pleased to report that we signed target and its  stores through a significant expansion part of the  retail sites we renewed globally this quarter despite the news from eleven this year the remainder of the  renewal story has been near perfect securing longterm renewals at a typical level of about five years for over  atms in total all in we have renewed almost  million in annual revenues an increase of almost  million for this quarter alone over what i shared with you last quarter lets move now to our european division our european business continues to perform very well it was a very active quarter for our team in the uk with a large focus on assimilating digesting and reconfiguring the various components of the sunwin and coop food group deal on the business development side we extended a pilot with another major grocery retailer we extended our relationship with shell uk for additional installations at dealerowned and dealeroperated sites and we signed two endorsement deals to be the atm supplier to retailer trade groups to potentially supply their thousands of small retail members now we had another significant company milestone in the uk this quarter that i believe demonstrates both the growing international profile of cardtronics and the dramatic differences in atm usage models between countries our uk business drove for the first time more transactions in this quarter than our comparable us business our doubledigit organic growth uk business which is currently about half the size of our us business in terms of revenues generated about  million withdrawal transactions in the third quarter while the atms we operate in the us generated approximately  million transactions i should point out that the us number excludes the recently acquired cds business that performed transaction processing for a number of third parties we have a very significant consumerfacing business in the uk as these volumes could represent every uk citizen – man woman and child – making almost two withdrawals at our atms during the third quarter alone we have an important network in the uk and are clearly providing a service that is of tremendous value to consumers and retailers alike in continental europe we continue to enjoy modest progress in our atm business in germany and poland we are closing in on our first  atms in the polish market and im pleased to announce that we have our first contract where we were added as a second atm supplier to a chain of stores in poland this will certainly help us broaden our view of the competitive landscape and continue our journey of learning in this exciting new market geographic expansion remains a key part of our growth strategy and we are actively at work in two additional markets in europe we have successfully recruited industry talents that know these markets and have impressive experience in developing these atm markets we are active in our geographic expansion activities and we are investing in both people and infrastructure i look forward to sharing future progress reports on this subject at the beginning of july you may recall that we closed on the acquisition of columbus data services as discussed last quarter cds is a bestinclass processor of atm and payment card transactions processing for over  atms for banks and nonbanks in the us the integration of additional cardtronics product offerings across the cds business is progressing and we look forward to further leveraging the cds assets cds has direct connections into all major credit and debit networks in the us which expands the cardtronics capability set and invites some opportunities for adjacency plays down the road focusing for a moment on total company transaction volumes it is noteworthy that the company generated  million transactions for the quarter two million transactions short of  billion you may recall that it is only eight months ago in our february earnings call that we recorded the milestone of  billion transactions for the entire year of  this is exciting growth i should add that our acquisition pipeline remains quite robust with opportunities in both existing and new markets and for businesses that are core and complementary adjacencies as always we remain disciplined and deliberate in what we ultimately execute but we feel well positioned financially and strategically to act on the appropriate opportunities these are very busy and exciting times for cardtronics we have a full agenda we have multiple pilots underway in the us on everything from advertising models to software rollouts that feature some of our new capabilities we are testing and learning about driving volume with technology and the product and compliance investments we have made over the past several years are finally beginning to roll out as part of the emv migration we are working with bank partners in both the us and canada on new and deeper relationship models that allow us to provide a richer customer experience for the consumer shared by the financial institution and the retailer a recent example of this is the capital one deal i mentioned earlier and we are seeing encouraging trends in the banking sector that ultimately favor our business model specifically branches are beginning to close in larger numbers transactions in branches are declining in material numbers and migrating to digital environments the consumer is doing more and more activity on digital channels and you need to know and recall that the atm is a digital channel and it is poised to be a big beneficiary of this transaction share shift from the traditional branch our goal is simple we want to be there to help and now i will turn it over to chris to provide more color on the financial dimensions of our third quarter results j chris brewster  chief financial officer thank you steve first id like to start as i usually do with a quick recap of the headline numbers for what was a strong quarter on multiple dimensions our consolidated revenues for the quarter were  million up  yearoveryear on a constant currency basis that metric would be up  adjusted ebitda totaled  million up  from last year and adjusted net income per diluted share was  up  versus last year eps would have been about  higher would have been about  without the currency headwinds that we had to fly through in the third quarter this pl performance demonstrates leverage in the business model  top line  further down at ebitda and  on the bottom line at net earnings with organic execution and acquisitions contributing in all areas of the income statement as implied in the numbers that i just gave you we were once again impacted by currency movements as the us dollar remained strong relative to the currencies employed in our foreign operations as i said on a constant currency basis our total revenue growth rate in local currency was  currency fluctuations cost us about  percentage points off of that so reported revenue growth in our reported us dollar financials was  beginning to split that apart organic atm operating revenue growth was about  on a constant currency basis in the quarter that organic growth was fueled by strong performance in europe certainly led by the uk europe revenues as a whole were up  as reported in dollars or up  on a constant currency basis the sunwin and coop food acquisitions definitely contributed to this robust revenue growth rate but organic growth in europe was strong as well at a little over  on a constant currency basis growth in our north america segment was solid at  with much of that driven by the acquisition of welch in the fourth quarter of last year and to a much lesser degree the recent cds acquisition both of which are performing quite well our us samestore transactions were about flat for the quarter which is a slight improvement from what we experienced in the second quarter this figure excludes the chase atm sites that were debranded within the last nine months us samestore revenues were up about  yearoveryear driven principally by our growth in allpoint and in bank branding revenues turning now to gross margin performance which as steve said was particularly strong this quarter gross margins expanded by  basis points yearoveryear to a level of  principally as a result of two things first is just fundamental scale economics coming through from our revenue growth and second the ongoing cost improvements that weve been making across the business particularly in cash costs vault cash rental costs and in armored car expenses i should point out that we turned in this gross margin performance in spite of a fairly significant list of contract renewals that we worked through in the course of the year those couldve put pressure on gross margins but we were able to maintain relatively constructive pricing dynamics in combination with operating efficiency gains columbus data services should also be given credit for playing a part in the margin expansion story coming in the door with the robust margins that we saw and liked as we considered the purchase of that business as we move further down the pl i will say that the sga picture does offset a bit of the goodness that we delivered on the gross margin line sga expense as a percent of revenue rose by about  basis points yearoveryear in spite of that the hefty gross margin gain allowed us to deliver about  basis points of margin expansion further down the pl on the adjusted ebitda line so adjusted ebitda margins were up about  basis points yearoveryear the elevated sga spending rate relates primarily to ongoing investments in technology in products and in people including added business development talent and management talent in the european team with the goals of fortifying organic revenue growth in existing markets and driving our entry into new markets couple of additional notes on the most recent acquisition of cds which was completed on july  of this year and which was consequently included in our results for the entirety of the third quarter im very pleased to report that the business is performing above planned on both revenue and earnings were quite pleased with the acquisition broadly its generating good numbers we remain excited about the management team and the goforward strategic rationale still looks compelling to us id like to mention that our adjusted profit metrics include a couple of significant adjustments in the quarter that were driven mainly by our sale of the retail cashintransit business in the uk so to do a quick memory refresh on the background of this transaction we bought sunwin services group in late  that operation consisted of a number of components some of which were strategically important and synergistic with us like atm maintenance and atm armored car service right in our wheelhouse and some of those components were not strategic to us like the provision of security guards to retailers and the transportation of notes and coins to and from retailers – the latter of which we call the retail cashintransit business we set about rationalizing this purchase as we came into  in quarter one we sold the security guard business and we merged the acquired atm maintenance operation in with our existing operation in quarter three we sold the operation providing cash transportation services to retailers for about £ million and we set about merging the remaining sunwin armored car operation which primarily serves atms with our existing operation and we closed six of the acquired cash depots to eliminate excess capacity and to extract cost efficiencies and i have to say i think our uk management team has just done a superb job managing its way through this process and this quantum of change as an aside we recorded about  million in revenue in  from these activities prior to their divestiture and those revenues should be taken out of our  base as you begin to think about  the sale of this retail cash transportation business also had an effect on our third quarter gaap pl which id like to describe in brief in the gaap pl for the third quarter youll notice a  million net gain on sale of assets this gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings metrics that we report this gain relates primarily to the sale of the retail cashintransit business that was closed during the quarter second theres another line on the gaap pl titled acquisition and divestiturerelated costs which totals about  million in expense for the quarter we also excluded this amount from our adjusted earnings metrics most of the expenses in this category also relate to the uk retail cashintransit sale and the subsequent shutting down of the six cash service facilities in the uk that i mentioned previously for example costs such as employee severance lease terminations professional fees associated with the transactions and costs incurred during the period that the facilities that were exited were open during the quarter all in all these line items mostly offset one another in the gaap pl but because theyre nonrecurring and not reflective of business than usual we excluded them from our adjusted metrics moving to the balance sheet our ratio of net debt outstanding to trailing  months adjusted ebitda at quarter end was  and that calculation includes the pro forma contribution from recent acquisitions that  level is up slightly from the  level that we reported at the end of quarter two primarily due to the  million that we spent on the cds acquisition total debt outstanding as of september  was  million with this continued modest and very manageable debt level and with  million currently available in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we believe we clearly have the ability to continue to pursue acquisitions and otherwise drive corporate growth turning the focus now to our  guidance id like to run through updated expectations for our key financial measures were tightening our revenue range and now expect revenues in the range of  billion to  billion were now expecting full year gross margins of approximately  to  both up a few tenths from prior guidance on the adjusted ebitda measure were leaving that range unchanged from our previous guidance  million to  million we expect depreciation expense to be  million to  million a slight change downward from our previous guidance range were expecting cash interest expense of about  million to  million and were raising and tightening our adjusted net income per diluted share range and are now expecting that measure to come in at approximately  to  a share up from prior guidance of  to  and thats on a share count of approximately  million diluted shares outstanding were leaving capital expenditure guidance unchanged at around  million to  million for the year so ill make a quick comment on the updated guidance obviously by putting out full year guidance at this time of year by implication we are also putting out fourth quarter guidance so if you look at the fourth quarter guidance that is implied by the full year guidance that i just gave you you would conclude that it shows a sequential decline from third to fourth quarter in adjusted earnings current consensus estimates show a flat eps progression from q to q but i have to say that thats not reflective of the typical seasonality of our business primarily due to weather we experienced lower volumes in the fourth quarter than the third this pattern did not play out last year on the bottom line because we closed the welch acquisition in early october  and the sunwin acquisition in early november  and they masked the underlining seasonality of our business so the sequentially downward move this year thats implied in our guidance between the third quarter and fourth quarter outcomes is just simply the manifestation of natural seasonality whats also shading our fourth quarter outlook a bit is the expectation that the currency headwind will be greater in q than it was in q so in closing on that subject i would simply say that the sequential trend thats implied in our guidance as we move from q to q is quite normal and is simply representative of normal seasonality of the business we would intend to put out  guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year as per our normal schedule after we complete our rather detailed budgeting process operator thats the end of our prepared remarks and wed now like to open up the call for any questions that listeners may have questionandanswer session operator and im showing our first question or comment comes from the line of ramsey elassal with jefferies your line is now open ramsey elassal  jefferies llc hey congratulations guys on another solid quarter i guess my first question is on margins i know there were great results there understanding that you attributed some of that to just general scale efficiency and operating leverage and then the rest is sort of more intentional actions how sustainable is the margin tailwinds that we have or maybe on the side of the drivers this quarter that were more sort of a result of your actions rather than just operating leverage j chris brewster  chief financial officer well id say in the aggregate theres – i didnt see anything in the margin story that i would – of any consequence that i would attribute to being sort of onetime if you will i would say that the third quarter is typically the highwater mark both in terms of revenue and percentage gross margins in the year so im not necessarily predicting that youre going to see  gross margins in every quarter as we go forward i think that would be a little unreasonable but i do think theres scope for continuing margin improvement the primary sources really were – we are in a position where were – we talk about pipelines we have an acquisition pipeline we have a new business pipeline we also have sort of an acquisition synergy pipeline were still gaining some benefits synergywise from welch certainly from the rationalization of the sunwin assets and the tuning if you will of the coop portfolio of atms that we brought in over in the uk and all of those things were helpful during the quarter ramsey elassal  jefferies llc okay that helps thanks on another note allpoint its an interesting statistic that youre in  of the top  credit unions of course that implies that theres another  of the top  that you could potentially be in as well what inning are we in in terms of allpoint penetration that statistic makes it sound like theres a lot of runway is that the case or are you sort of – where do you think we are in terms of general penetration of that product in the marketplace steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director this is steve ramsey i think still quite early i dont know if you want to pick third inning or fourth inning but its not fifth sixth or seventh i think there are many thousands of financial institutions out there and im convinced that every one of them can benefit from allpoint and our job is to help them see the wisdom of that opportunity so i think there is a long runway for allpoint and i think when i talk about the trends in the banking industry where we are thinking about how to integrate further with banks to enrich the experience of the consumer whether it be deposit taking whether it be a richer transaction set by having more direct links with the bank there is an opportunity for us to continue to be more and more infrastructure which effectively is what allpoint is right it acts as the banks infrastructure and were on a mission to be every banks infrastructure over time ramsey elassal  jefferies llc okay a couple of really quick ones has there been any movement in terms of link resetting the uk pricing j chris brewster  chief financial officer ramsey as you know i think they do a crosssurvey every year they typically do it in the middle of the year and at that point set an interchange rate for the following year that process has been done im told by our folks in the uk that under link rules were prohibited from disclosing the results of that process so we havent made a habit of talking about it publicly but the answer to your question is yes that has played out ramsey elassal  jefferies llc but youre precluded from sharing the actual impact of the move on your j chris brewster  chief financial officer that is my understanding i think you know how it works let me talk about what i can talk about i think you know basically how the process works you know it is a cost based sort of price setting methodology there hasnt been a lot of change in certain parameters like interest rates there has been some change in what over in the uk are called business rates in the us we call them property taxes there has been some increase in that and that began occurring back in  as i recall so ill let you use your imagination on the rest of it i guess ramsey elassal  jefferies llc okay and very quickly and lastly for me an awkward question the cfo search chris have your plans been altered at all or are you still actively involved in selecting a replacement or whats the update there steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director the update is were making good progress we have a very credible and viable candidate were working hopefully to close soon and ill let chris speak for chris but our intentions remain to have chris actively involved in the transition over the medium term and to be available to us essentially all next year on some kind of a retainer basis to help with transition activities i still expect that schedule to be intact as we come and close in on the end of the year ramsey elassal  jefferies llc okay great take your time on that theres no rush steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director im trying to turn back the clock but it just wont work every time i look in the mirror i approve j chris brewster  chief financial officer the only thing i would add i can see why to an outsiders perspective it might look like this is taking a little while but the only thing i would add perhaps in that context is that frankly steve and the board are setting a very high bar steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director and you all can understand why based on what youve been working with right ramsey elassal  jefferies llc great thats very helpful thats all for me guys thanks operator and our next question or comment comes from the line of andrew jeffrey with suntrust your line is now open andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hi guys thanks for taking the question i concur chris you can stay around for as long as youd like focusing in on the uk for a second where in europe generally where youre driving doubledigit growth whats the runway and the visibility to sustainability of that and now youve got a european management team that perhaps is a little more focused in on the day to day theyve been doing a lot of heavy lifting so in terms of innovating around the basic atm transaction what are your thoughts on that and what might we see or hear about transaction yield improvement over time in europe steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director well i think what i can say is this the european team is focused on europe as opposed to just the uk and then there is a uk team focused on just the uk so we have invested in more muscle over there as time has gone on and we expect to have in our  numbers some decent investment in product innovation type funding for the uk market in specific and we expect to have some meaningful investment dollars for continuing market and geography expansion so i think the sustainability of the growth in europe is there i think the form it will take will inevitably surprise me well certainly be aware of directions but it will take multiple forms and but id be hard pressed to say that theres going to be a dramatic improvement in yield on particularly atm from product initiatives well have more insight into that as we work down the list i think theres like eight or nine things that weve got the teams looking at to see what they can do for us but perhaps another way to think about it is articles in the newspaper i referred in my comments about branch closings in the us in the uk theyve talked about  of the branches being closed over time and as branches close i think there is a substantial opportunity for movement for the consumer to atms that are the most convenient which tend to be ours and i think the uk has the additional advantage over the us of not having any foreign fees so the freedom of movement for the consumer is strong but my hope is that cardtronics can play a big role in helping banks be way more efficient by being their atm infrastructure as bank branches begin to wind down over there as they reset as all banks are doing on the new economics of banking andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay chris when i look at your operating metrics excluding acquisitions and i look at per atm cash withdrawal transaction growth and atm revenues theres still a little bit of a slowdown in the third quarter versus the first nine months whats the driver there the geographic mix is there something else because i think you mentioned that you saw a little bit of improvement in your us and machine transactions and revenues j chris brewster  chief financial officer yeah im trying to make sure i properly parse your question andrew which metric are you looking at andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc per atm cash withdrawal transactions the  versus  that organic number j chris brewster  chief financial officer and youre looking at on an ex of acquisitions basis andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc correct yeah j chris brewster  chief financial officer yeah i think frankly what youre seeing is just an effective mix shift that relate to our prior history of acquisitions that we cycled on for more than a year and as we move through the quarter that group changes in a sense in terms of exactly what we cycled on as i think about the business and its components for example thinking about the big us companyowned portfolios the us merchantowned portfolios so on and so forth and think about whats going on within those components i dont think theres any significant changes in trends andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc so youd encourage us to look at the samemachine transactions and the samemachine revenues in the us as the best metric for the health of the underlying business j chris brewster  chief financial officer i think samemachine revenues is probably the best metric samemachine transactions is a good metric the averages are going to be moved around by mix shift we started – simply the growth of high volume freetouse atms in the uk can move the metrics around steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director the welchkahuna blend is affecting the metrics around j chris brewster  chief financial officer right andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay j chris brewster  chief financial officer so i think ill spend some more time on it andrew but thats my off the cuff – is youre simply looking at the effects of shifts in mix of machine types as opposed to sort of broad underlying trend andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it all right thanks operator our next question or comment comes from the line of bob napoli with william blair your line is now open robert napoli  william blair  co llc thank you and good afternoon i guess maybe just some big picture thoughts steve if you could on the atm and digital – i just spent about a week in vegas it feels like a month – like money and all the investment going into digital and contactless the general thought is that that is obviously going to put pressure on cash and cash withdrawals and youre seeing that in some places around the world but how do you feel about the ability to grow organically given that and i know youve mentioned remember the atm is digital so youre suggesting that you will have a lot more transactions other than cash that may be growing on those machines steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director so its the eternal question bob and money always has a way of igniting it i did not attend but i certainly had a bunch of reports coming across the transom about the goingson there and we had some folks out there and such one of the compelling thoughts that i heard about was theres this notion this continuing notion of people trying to solve the problem of cash as if cash is a problem and they keep coming up against the inability to solve it and the reason they have the inability is because its not broken now that doesnt mean that things like chase pay that was announced out there and other activities wont create a customer experience around payments that do change the dynamic over time but the messages i heard from the money conference from multiple sources all suggest a sort of grudging acceptance of cash isnt going anywhere and really the mission is about trying to create a better payment experience and so far thats been pretty hard to do so one part of the answer is i remain unconvinced that any time soon cash is going to be swept away by some brand new invention from some silicon valley startup theres just no evidence of that and increasingly you heard people on panels there talk about the fact that they need to partner with entities as opposed to openly replace this vehicle called cash so thats one sense the other sense the other dimension is what i talked about earlier the digitization of banking not the digitization of money but the digitization of banking and banking services is driving people out of the branch you pick up any top  bank or top  bank annual report or investor deck and go through their stories about whats going on with the branch volumes with the branch transactions and the fact that theres a migration to things like deposits outside the branch or away from the tally counter at least and if you look at the underlying statistics that they make available youll see that the digitization of deposit taking is happening mostly at the atm not mostly at the mobile phone so there is a series of environmental shifts a series of trends that i think favor the cardtronics business model because the atm will be a piece of infrastructure for many many many years to come that is incredibly significant to the bank and the banks customers and we just have to optimize the relationship with the bank and thats why i love this capital one deal where were brokering the atm with deposittaking capability and a much richer relationship with target than weve had in the past with capital one engage and its to me a symptom a symbol of the future model of engagement for companies like cardtronics where we will increasingly draw volume from the bank environment in partnership with the bank so windy answer sorry about that but its the eternal question and the problem of cash isnt the problem to be solved the problem of expense ratios in banks is the problem to be solved and were here to help robert napoli  william blair  co llc great then a question on the ma pipeline i guess to the extent you can and discussion about adjacencies what adjacencies make the most sense are we going to see some diversification into pre pay bill pay – what areas are you looking to acquire into what makes the most sense outside of your core business steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director well i think thats that million dollar question and i think its fair to say that i feel its a little premature to start listing categories but what i can say is cardtronics is very actively engaged with great inside lines and great outside lines on how to extend our business model into adjacencies that make sense and the combination of that intellectual journey that we are on in combination with what appears to be a very robust set of items for sale companies for sale several of which seem to make obvious sense several of which we have to think about and just because it seems to obviously make sense by the way as you all know it doesnt mean it does so i would ask you to bear with us a bit longer but rest assured that we are allocating intellectual capital and dollar capital toward diversification journeys and i expect  to be an important year in that regard robert napoli  william blair  co llc okay thank you operator and our next question or comment comes from the line of meghna ladha with susquehanna your line is now open meghna ladha  susquehanna financial group lllp hi thanks for taking my question im just trying to understand the revenue opportunity from dynamic currency conversion can you help me understand how we should think about that and what percent of your atm installed base currently provides dcc j chris brewster  chief financial officer well ill take a whack at it in europe the majority of our atm base can provide that service where its truly effective as you might imagine is only in places where you have significant numbers of international travelers coming through in other words in the context of the uk its pretty important in central london its not necessarily all that effective in some smaller town off in the midlands somewhere but it is now a nice – i would call it a nice contributor to uk revenue in particular to uk profit because its a high margin transaction in the us id say the answer is a lot more diverse as you might imagine its effectiveness would be limited to major cities where you have a lot of international travel east coast west coast places like houston and dallas and atlanta and along the borders the canadian border mexican border so a relatively small minority of our us fleet is now dcc capable and that will change rather dramatically as we go through the emv upgrades and roll out a new software stack alongside of that that has significantly enhanced capabilities in it so i think the product is partly because its so far away from being fully implemented in the states has a pretty solid growth runway in front of it steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director and its a product were actually working to make available not only at our own atms but the merchantowned atms that we provide services to and thats a very rich margin opportunity for us so were looking forward over the next  months to driving some good value out of that meghna ladha  susquehanna financial group lllp thanks that was helpful and also just wanted to get your thoughts on consolidation recently there was a piece in the news that walgreens plans to acquire rite aid so given some of the consolidation in the states do you foresee any margin pressure in terms of higher merchant commissions steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director well i think that those are always tough questions to answer but i can say the following chris talked earlier in his prepared remarks about the fact that weve had this wonderful gross margin improvement during a year where weve done a bunch of renewals okay and the linkage there is that weve managed to avoid any serious margin compression in renewals and in fact have enjoyed an improvement of terms i talked in the past about the fact that its very important for the stability of future earnings to get things like interest rate protections and interest exchange rate protections and weve worked very hard for the past three years to do that and ive also said im quite willing to ensure those protections to surrender a little bit of margin but i think that each circumstance is unique and i think that mega mergers like the one you were talking about will certainly present interesting conversations and well engage to deliver the best value we can fortunately i believe we stand poised to deliver more products more proof of instore sales and more capabilities to support incremental instore sales at exactly the right time relative to this particular example youre putting forward and that i think is a good thing in terms of our opportunity to preserve margin and enhance ultimately j chris brewster  chief financial officer yeah the only thing i would add to that is to say that its definitely not new news consolidation among our customers is definitely not new news around here weve seen it in the grocery space there are numerous examples among our convenience store customers where weve had mergers involving multiple customers over time and weve been through the whole sort of sea change in the petroleum retailing business from major oil companies operating that business to selling it off to independents and then a lot of those independents merging so its something obviously we pay attention to but its certainly not something thats radically new and different on the landscape meghna ladha  susquehanna financial group lllp got it and a very quick one on eleven have there been discussions on the timeline as far as redeploying the atms are concerned and what programs or services do you believe remain based upon the expiration of the contract steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director well i think as we stated in the past that that contract expires in july  late july  and i think the appropriate way to think about it at this time is that the contract is fully engaged through that period and then conversions begin so theres an opportunity to enjoy continued returns on that for the back half of  relative to a conversion schedule i think the question as to the redeployment opportunity thats a muddier question very difficult to see exactly today where wed redeploy some of those things but as sales opportunities comes up as renewals come up we can certainly plan for that weve said in the past that we do expect to redeploy a significant amount of that equipment and theres a significant amount thats already written effectively written off and a piece in the middle that as we get closer will get very close to being written off so we continue to think that it spells more of a capital relief opportunity than it does sitting on capital opportunity but its difficult to answer the second part of your question but be assured that we are creatively at work trying to figure out how to optimize our shareholder value each and every day and it certainly includes how to preserve the opportunities weve created in that market space meghna ladha  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you and congratulations on a good quarter steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director oh thank you j chris brewster  chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question or comment comes from the line of reggie smith with jpmorgan your line is now open reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc hey good evening guys thanks for taking my question i appreciate i guess the color you guys provided on the uk i didnt realize that the transaction counts were actually larger than the united states i guess my question and im not sure if you provided that but whats the samestore sales or organic transaction growth rates in the uk just curious if the dynamics over there are similar to the united states from a growth perspective steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director id say on a marketwide basis i think that would be a pretty good conclusion frankly youve got some of the same macro drivers with bank branch closings there are certainly some payment innovations where at the margins might be taking a little bit out of cash but if you look at the overall market statistics or if you look at say our samestore transaction trends theyre relatively similar reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc in the uk versus in the united states steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director uk versus us now thats on the samestore basis on an organic basis the uk market is significantly less installed than the us market in terms of say a metric like number of atms per million people in the market from memory im thinking that the us is around  the uk is more like  numbers of that nature so on a percentage basis weve certainly been doing better in the uk in terms of unit growth than we have in the us reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc understood i guess a followup to that i know in the past you talked about the foreign atm fees being a factor thats kind of weighed on samestore sales growth in the us now in the uk i believe most atms are free to use for cardholders so i guess trying to square that commentary or maybe if there are other factors that are at play in the uk that would explain why samestore sales trends are kind of similar to the united states steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director well i think i would square it this way in the us the bad news is weve got foreign fees that tend to represent a drag on – i believe at least on our transaction counts the good news is weve got bank branding and allpoint pushing transaction counts in the right direction in the uk we dont have the negative of foreign fees but since most atms there are free to use to all comers the concept of the allpoint surchargefree network as you might imagine is somewhat less powerful than it would be in the united states and the bank branding environment is less mature than it is in the us if you will so i think youve got offsetting forces that seem to bring the metrics pretty closely into an equivalency reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc got it understood if i could sneak two more in really quickly i guess domestically the potential to raise surcharges and then i guess my last question would be given where the stock is today recognizing that you guys do have some acquisitions in the pipeline have you guys given any thought to maybe a share repurchase or something along those lines thank you steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director why dont you do the last part j chris brewster  chief financial officer ill take the second one and ill leave the first one for steve we thought fairly hard recently or at least id say done the thinking and analysis around a share buyback but we continue to come back to the same place then and that is that we do have a robust acquisition pipeline we see continued opportunities to put capital to work at high returns in the course of acquisitions and it just goes back to the – wouldve been the fundamentals of this business for a decade or more and that is scale matters and synergies tend to be robust and thats very helpful in terms of driving a highreturn acquisition strategy id tell you if the time comes when that acquisition pipeline looks less robust and does so for a period of time then as weve told you before theres no interest in here taking the company out of debt or dramatically deleveraging it if we get to the point where we dont have those sort of opportunities to invest capital at high returns then we i think have to consider alternate – other ways other things to do with capital including funneling it back to shareholders reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc got it steven a rathgaber  chief executive officer  director and on the surcharge question i think i would answer it that it is always on our radar we do constantly studies about where our atm population sits relative to other populations there has been an increase in surcharges by a lot of the larger financial institutions theres also been an increase in foreign fees by a lot of the larger financial institutions so one of the pleasantly surprising things is the elasticity of the collective course of doing an atm transaction where now we have lots of locations where the financial institutions are probably making as much money – theyre charging as much money making more because its essentially all margins from their side as we charge for a surcharge so the consumer is quite durable in terms of being willing to pay having said all that we think its never been our position to be the market leader in raising surcharges we like to be a quiet follower and if you saw some of the trade press recently or heard chuck schumer talking about a study in the wall street journal and that study was effective at illuminating the foreign fee increases so were kind of excited about that awareness but dont think any of it portends any material changes on our part to raise surcharges in the near term reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you guys good quarter steven a rathgaber
