rated  out of  by  rated  out of  by dani from my favorite we received our quaker popped bags yesterday as our first bzzagent campaign we opened and taste tested each bag as a family my daughters preferred the caramel flavor the best while my husband preferred the cheddar and my favorite was the sour cream and onion  we are very different when it comes to tastes we all agreed that they were great snacks and i even had to take the bag away from my daughter so she would eat her dinner my only complaint is that we only received one bag of caramel i can see us taking these on road trips or packing in lunches for school we obviously were pleased with the product date published  rated  out of  by deborah from new family favorite i received  bags of quaker popped rice crisps to try and share as part of a bzz campaign ive tried rice cakes before and while they were okay they were never a family favorite rice cakes may not be a favorite but rice crisps sure are all three flavors were a hit in our house the caramel corn being the favorite the sour cream and onion and the cheddar are also very good the fact that they are gluten free and are are chocked full of whole grains in each serving make them our go to healthy snack this light crispy treat is sure to win your family over too the only drawback is they are so good its hard to stop with just one serving date published  rated  out of  by mommaweigle from my kids went crazy over these i have very picky eatersmy kids range in age from  months to   years old getting them to eat a healthy snack isnt the hard part its getting them to finish the snack we received these quaker popped from being a bzzagent which allowed for us to try them for free we had the sour cream and onion cheddar cheese and caramel my son ate an entire bag by himself he absolutely loves them my daughters love them too but missed out on eating too many because my son loved them so much ha ha i highly recommend these for parents with younger children who are looking for a healthy snack kudos to you quaker bzzagent gotitfree date published  rated  out of  by mikescatherine from no guilt snacking  i received a sample of the quaker popped sour cream and onion rice snacks to try out and provide my honest reviewfirst off i liked the texture of the quaker popped sour crean and onion rice snacks they are crunchy without being too hard the flavour is good as well they arent too salty either i think there make a great replacement for chips any day my kids even liked them which is hard to find a glutenfree snack that they enjoy overall i give them  out of  stars great texture flavors availability is good too just dont forget to use a bag clip as they get stale quicklybzzagent and quaker provided me with free samples of this product to review date published  rated  out of  by ajerickson from sour cream and chive please i tried quaker popped rice krisps for free from quaker and i was surprised i thought for sure this gluten free rice snack would be grainy and hard like all the other rice snacks on the market out there but i was wrong the sour cream and chive was a delicious treatdidnt make me feel like i was eating anything gluten free the krisps were a good texture and the flavor was yummy i could of ate the entire bagbut i refrained myself so my kids could share in the yumminess my nephew has celiac so i try to keep a gluten free snack in the house when he visitslooks like i ll have to pick up more since they are all gone now thanks quaker date published  rated  out of  by missrugby from addicted to popped i was a little skeptical that popped would be a tasteful snack and i was pleasantly surprised as a bzzagent i received five bags in the mail to try these are my new favorite snack i have made a vow that i would live a healthier lifestyle and quaker popped are a huge help i love to snack on things but there arent many healthy alternatives my six year old son even loves them the sour cream are our favorite but they are all wonderful i have told everyone about these little gems i do wish the sour cream flavor were easily found in stores like the other flavors but apparently they are everyone elses favorite as well date published  rated  out of  by haustin from a hit with family i was excited to try this product when i got it free from bzzagent my family really likes quaker popped rice crisps we like them for snacking since they are the perfect size and i feel good about offering them as a healthier alternative to chips or crackers we love the flavors and the crunch the sour cream and onion is my year old sons favorite and he has turned down chips to eat thesethe taste is light and feels like a modern take on the rice cake i remember rice cakes as tasting like cardboard but popped rice crisps do not taste like cardboard popped rice crisps have good flavor and contain whole grains well be eating these again date published  rated  out of  by sandratwp from a big hit at our house i received these sour cream  onion popped rice crisps free as a bzzagent in order to promote the brand im going to be honest this was not my favorite flavor i didnt hate it i think i was just really looking forward to a sour cream and onion snack and found this one to be a bit mild without enough tang for what i was hoping forthat said my husband devoured the entire bag he generally eats sour cream  onion snacks more often than i and i have to say i think that maybe my palate is just off the mark he thoroughly enjoyed these popped rice crisps and i have no doubt would be very happy to see them in the cabinet again date published  quaker popped  sour cream and onion reviews  page  y m d h bvseobulk prodbvrr vnbulkhotfix cp bvpage cohasreviews tv tr locenus sid prod sortsortentryorderrelevance
