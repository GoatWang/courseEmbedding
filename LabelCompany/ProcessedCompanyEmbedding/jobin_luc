paul and welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call well today the cn team is pleased to report another very strong quarter our performance was driven by a sizeable increase in revenues building on volume momentum which started in the fourth quarter of  our growth in the second quarter was also broadbased and achieved across most business sectors translating into an  rise in rtms meanwhile we maintain our inflationplus pricing discipline jj will give you more color on our record quarterly revenue performance and a sense of what’s in store for the second half of the year from an operating standpoint mike and his team worked very hard to accommodate this level of growth while staying true to our commitment to balance service and efficiency the result is evident in our operating ratio of  up only  basis points versus last year and our record operating income in the quarter looking at the bottom line the strength of our quarterly financial results speak for themselves diluted eps of  up  adjusted diluted eps of  up  and solid free cash flow generation of  million in the quarter ghislain will expand on key financial highlights for the second quarter on the call later today and address as well our outlook for the year let me now turn the call over to mike who will give you a sense for how the operating team has brought on board the substantial volume increase we’ve experienced thus far this year while maintaining our industryleading performance mike mike cory thank you very much luc and then first let me just happy anniversary to the team here in the room for a very successful first year together overall i’m extremely proud of the operating team’s performance in this quarter it’s really a testament to their execution of our operational and service excellence agenda our volume growth in this quarter has been the largest in my  years with cn and who would have ever forecasted a  frac sand increase in one quarter but that’s not the entire story this increase is broadbased across business segments and operating regions as a result of the volume increase on top of attrition we are hiring for all the operating groups with new skillset demands with the evolution of ptc technology and automation bring our attention to proper onboarding and integration is greater than i have ever experienced i’m really proud of what this team has accomplished so far and it’s a testament to the culture of excellence that we’ve created that we’re able to manage this type of growth and change environment and produce very solid results so let’s take a look at those results the volumes in  provided an opportunity to reduce people and assets most roads if not all saw the benefit of added capacity to more experienced workforces line and terminal space and less unproductive assets in the mix train speed terminal dwell fuel and locomotive productivity all improved as a result so for context i’m using a similar volume period against the same infrastructure backdrop actually my comparison of  isn’t exactly that as workload or gtms were  less in  than they are in   is actually a truer comparison workload or gtmwise but we did make infrastructure improvements in  so i’m going to use  as the example the biggest driver of locomotive utilization and car velocity is train speed with the yearoveryear growth our train speed has declined and affected both of these metrics however in comparison to  again even though volumes were still  lower than this year we improved our velocity while matching both train speed and locomotive utilization we did this through an aggressive approach to increasing train size something that we will continue to focus on on a productivity front both our yard and train productivity improved over both  and  our plan to tackle train speed reduction is in place it includes both innovative approaches as well as improvements that will be made through capacity and safety investments our focus on efficiency and reliability with never weigh in with a longer term plan to fundamentally change operations through technology automation and optimization the introduction of new operational and service systems will provide the opportunity for our customers to grow their market efficiently on the safety front we continue to build the greater understanding of risk awareness within our team we are capitalizing on our strong relationship with our operating unions to ensure everyone genuinely looks out for each other our f reaction ratio ph did increase from  to  on a yearoveryear comparable while both those numbers are continues improvement over the last five year run rate our accident costs this quarter well in line with previous year’s run rates were higher than in  for injuries we are slightly up over our ratio for last year comparing the last five year run rate though we continue to improve on the absolute number however productivity improvements that reduced human work hours have affected the ratio to all of us this slip is just not acceptable in regardless of volume increase and mix of employee experience we know that our most valuable asset is our people and we will correct this overall we are working very hard to improve our safety record and have a number of initiatives headed up by newly developed an integrated team overall i am very pleased with team’s performance in the quarter with the volume growth we definitely have challenging conditions to deliver these results it’s clear the team came through once again and i am grateful for the opportunity to lead them with that over to you jj jeanjacques ruest well thank you mike and a great job on moving all these trains today i’ll keep my comment to three high level topics i will start with a highlevel description of how we achieved success in the last quarter followed by last quarter major volumes and i’ll close with recent progress on our commercial agenda so let’s start with how we achieved success in the last quarter first we outperformed the economy our revenue was up  million or  above last year yeartodate our revenue was up almost  million or  above last year more preciously  million we also outperformed the rail industry cn’s aar carloads were up  which is the industry average of  in q yeartodate our carloads were up  above last year which is the industry average of  also very important to us is to achieve broadbased diversified source of growth and to that point all of our business units produced good growth this quarter on top of that three segments have had all time record – company record mainly international containers automotive finished vehicle and frac sand for oil and gas drilling finally we generated samestore price above real inflation at  for the quarter and  for yeartodate i will now highlight selected segment that produced the most volumes frac sand as mike mentioned was up  total canadian grain carloads were up  container volume from vancouver south shore vanterm and centerm terminal were up a combined  potash carloads were up almost  automotive carloads were up  it is worth noting cn enrolled about  of all the finished vehicle sold in canada coal carloads were down  where revenue was up a solid  because of business mix the port of montreal and halifax volume when combined were up  our volume for natural gas liquid plastic pellets and condensates were down the canadian dollar in our fuel surcharge program versus last year were both positive tailwind to our reported revenues respectively  million for fx  million for the fuel now i will highlight recent progress on our commercial agenda the new customers that we onboarded earlier this year are delivering solid growth the port of prince rupert created an alltime high rail volume in june at goldomen ph for the upcoming three years saint prolacerblair ph wisconsin opened a new frac sand mine on cn and we expect another of our sand customers wisconsin proppant company of exten ph wisconsin to further increase production on cn as well crude volume bounced back from last year’s fort mcmurray fire but the last eastern canada refinery that was using crude by rail will stop doing so sometime in late august whirlpool announced they will build a regional distribution center in our calgary logistics park which further progress our coal location strategy with distribution centers in etimoro ph but our strategy also applies to grain where we have a number of grain country elevators either as newbuild of expansion of existing elevators to be done by viterra cargill grainsconnect g ph aialta ph and the same colocation strategy also applied to export transload we have remo logistics ph who are building a major gain transfer facility in rupert for this summer cma the ocean shipping line will start a new service on the east coast at the port of saint john new brunswick further building our three core strategic advantage and the case for the port of saint john our strategy focus is on ocean container on cosupply chain business and on bulk export of potash the new dilute minnesota container terminal is now in operation and we are also finalizing plans to have a container terminal service in regina by the  grain crop this is further advancing our overall strategy of increasing our geographic reach by adding new and more destination and last but not least our technology business team which is now fully staffed is in full project development mode to digitize cn next generation of supply chain services and build the foundation of our future competitive edge in conclusion to wrap this up we have a good diversified quarter with a number of good business unit coming through with good results the economic outlook for q will constructive and we’re on to act for the fullyear volume guidance ghislain you want to pick it up from here ghislain houle thanks jj starting on page  of the presentation i will summarize the key financial highlights of our solid second quarter performance as jj previously pointed out revenues for the quarter were  versus last year at slightly over  billion fuel lag on a yearoveryear basis represented a revenue tailwind of  million or  of eps mostly driven by an unfavorable lag in the second quarter of  for the same amount operating income was slightly under  billion up  million or  versus last year our operating ratio came in at  or  basis points higher than last year fuel prices at no impact on the increase this quarter net income stood at  billion or  higher than last year with reported diluted earnings per share of  adjusted eps was up  to  from a year earlier eps of  excluding the impact on deferred income tax expense from the enactments of changes in provisional income tax rates in both years the impact of foreign currency was  million favorable on net income or  of eps in the quarter turning to expenses on page  as mike previously pointed out we continue to make progress in the quarter in terms of efficiency gain including discipline cost management initiatives despite a significant increase in volumes our operating expenses were up  versus last year at just over  billion mostly driven by stronger volumes and higher incident costs express on a constant currency basis this represents a  increase at this point i will refer to the variances in constant currency labor and fringe benefit expenses were  million or  higher than last year as increased wages and incentive compensation expenses were partly offset by higher capital credits on a fullyear basis we still expect pension expense to be roughly flat versus last year purchased services and material expenses were  million or  higher than last year this was mostly the result of higher outsourced services and repair and maintenance costs mostly driven by higher volumes fuel expense stood at  million or  higher than last year higher volumes accounted for  million increase and price was an unfavorable variance of  million versus  fuel productivity was about  improvement in the quarter versus last year depreciation stood at  million or  higher than last year mostly as a result of net asset additions equipment rents were up  versus last year driven by increased car hire partly offset by lower lease expense casualty and other costs were  million which was  million higher than last year mostly driven by higher incident cost of  million and an increase in environmental provision of  million for the balance of the year we can expect about  million to  million per quarter for casualty and other moving to cash on page  we generated free cash flow  million through the end of june this is  million higher than in  and mostly the result of higher cash generated from operating activity lower capital expenditures and lower cash taxes finally our  financial outlook on page  we achieved solid volumes in the first half of the year reflecting strong performance across most segments we continue to see favorable economic conditions in north america including a stronger than expected canadian economy in addition consumer confidence remains positive while a strong energy sector is driving shipments of frac sands and steel pipes crude volumes are strong but this remains a spot business however we expect volume growth in the second half of the year to be more challenged as comparable with  will be more difficult particularly in the fourth quarter we believe this environment should continue to translate into volume growth of approximately  in terms of rtms for the full year versus  with overall pricing remaining above inflation we have experienced – we have recently experienced the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus us dollar and assuming the current spot rate of around  this will create a headwind on earnings going technical difficulty us dollar results in an annual headwind on net income of approximately  million or  of eps despite the dollar headwind we are reaffirming our guidance and continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of  to  versus  adjusted diluted eps of  in fact to foreign exchange remained at  we could finish at the upper range – at the upper end of our range on the capital front we remain committed to reinvesting in our business to support safety service and growth in this regard we continue to target a capital envelope of  billion for the year and about  of revenues going forward furthermore we continue to reward our shareholders with consistent dividend returns and we are on track with our current share buyback program of approximately  billion having repurchased just over  million shares for  billion since last october in closing we remain committed to our agenda and continue to manage the business to deliver sustainable value today and for the long term on this note back to you luc luc jobin all right thank you ghislain so in closing let me add a few words looking ahead we hold a positive view of the economic environment and we expect to have volume growth in the second half although we will be facing some tougher comps versus last year our strategy of leveraging cn’s superior supply chain approach to grow faster than the underlying markets continues to bear fruits and jj highlighted a number of opportunities for us on the way forward mike and our operating team are energized and all hands are on deck to balance operational and service excellence our focus remains on delivering value for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders in spite of a stronger canadian dollars ghislain confirmed that we’re also on track to deliver against our early outlook both in terms of earnings and reinvesting in our franchise so on that note we’re happy to now take your questions and we’ll turn the call back over to you patrick questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions thank you for your patience the first question is from ravi shanker from morgan stanley please go ahead ravi shanker thanks good evening everyone a couple of questions if i can squeeze it in one is on pricing clearly this is an industrywide issue and you guys saw a sequentially price deceleration like everybody else but can you just elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of this and as inflation increased in the second half what could be your sources of price again jeanjacques ruest hi ravi it’s jj so at  i believe that we are in the range of our industry we’re also in the range of the first quarter on the grain side we do seasonal pricing so we don’t take the grain cap and spread over  months we apply for that price increase when the demand is strongest and take it away when the demand is least but at  i think we are meeting our objective of samestore price above real inflation real inflation is below that at this point and i think the… ravi shanker and as it increase into the – sorry go ahead jeanjacques ruest and i think there were forward dust terrains ph that we’re in as an industry ravi shanker good thank you jeanjacques ruest thank you operator thank you the next question is from fadi chamoun from bmo capital markets please go ahead fadi chamoun okay thank you good evening everyone so jj just a question on the crude by rail which seems like it could be significant opportunity for you guys going into  and maybe even at the end of this year can you give us your thought on this if you had any discussion with producers what this opportunity might look like and sort of potential timing of that ramp up jeanjacques ruest yes i think fadi i like one of your headlines from one of your report where you say crude by rail opportunity interesting but not yet exciting meaning there is not yet a capacity shortage of the pipeline capacity so production is ramping up depending on who you talk to it may be later this year or early this year but production need to exceed pipeline capacity at which time there will be a window for crude by rail to move product from alberta to wherever the consumer within north america but at this point it’s not part of really of a basecase that we expect a lot of crude by rail pickup in  anyway but if there is we do have the network and a lot of power to do that so we are in position to be able to do that and in february the canadian grain crop is little less than the average that crude by rail will be a nice way to fill up the second and third quarter of  at this point it’s a whole cart it’s – we have to wait for the pipeline industry to be tight operator thank you the next question is from walter spracklin from rbc please go ahead walter spracklin thanks very much good afternoon everyone so i guess my – i want to focus here on grain and the outlook here and i know moisture levels are pretty low on the prairies right now so my question is how do you look at your forecast versus a fairly significant comp from last year how should we be modeling an average crop or the risk that it goes below average and do you expect that to be aggravated by any share loss relative to a fairly strong share gain you had last year so could you talk whether you think you’re going to lose a little bit of share next year temporarily if anything and what the impact downside could be if we don’t get any rain in the prairies here in the near term jeanjacques ruest so if we take the usual pattern of the year it’s jj in the third quarter what really matters is how early is the crop is it coming in – is it harvested in early september so we can move in september or is it coming in quite late where it’s too late for the third quarter when it gets to the fourth quarter every year might seem railroad very hard because we do the ph crop is super big or less than average everybody wants to sell grain in the fourth quarter so we run flat out typically the same thing in wintertime so the size of the crop is really a second and third quarter  question and that’s really i think it’s too early to tell we will know by the time we have the third quarter results in the – in midoctober we will know how big is that crop and then we’ll know the story for  in term of share i would advise that people not to bet against us we’re pretty competitive when it comes to the marketplace luc jobin yes we – let’s just say walter that we don’t plan on losing share and the rest for us is all upside and we’re focused on growing the business so we’ll how – and we’ll see how things unfold walter spracklin great thank you very much luc jobin thank you jeanjacques ruest thank you operator thank you the next question is from tom wadewitz from ubs please go ahead thomas wadewitz yes good afternoon just wanted to see if you had – i guess we’ve heard from bsx ph and they’ve talked about some people from another organization that knows about precision railroading that some operational talent has come over to them it’s not real clear what level or whether that’s from directly from your former cn people but i just want to see if you could comment on whether there are concerned about any kind of operational managers being in – whether that is something you’ve seen at this point thanks mike cory hey tom it’s mike here yes look we’ve lost a few frontline supervisors so really the effect is small and just so everybody is clear my job my team’s job is to continue to key – teach coach develop people so that we can look down the bench and always have the right amount – the right type of people in line and right now i look down the bench and i’m extremely comfortable so it’s a compliment for others to comment or emulator approach and we’ll continue to develop people and go forward but no issue on our part thomas wadewitz is there way to kind of frame the magnitude of it like it doesn’t sound like something you concerned about but is there a way to say how many out of that level of – is it two out of  people at that level or anyway to kind of gauge it mike cory i guess i’d use the word – the word is not significant thomas wadewitz just not significant okay thank you i appreciate it mike cory thanks tom luc jobin thank you operator thank you the next question is from cherilyn radbourne from td securities please go ahead cherilyn radbourne thanks very much and good afternoon i wanted to give jj bit of a break by asking mike a question obviously continued strong performance in accommodating the volume growth that you had and i think most of us in the call would have some familiarity with how mix can impact metrics like revenue per carload or revenue per rtm but i just wondered if you could speak in a bit more detail about how you look at those six key operating metrics and assess them internally in light of a volume growth in mix to assess how well you’ve done jeanjacques ruest hi cherilyn really it’s been a little bit difficult of a year in terms of trying to compare it to a previous especially  with the volume growth itself – the key components here where we look at train speed car velocity locomotive productivity locomotive utilization those things are going to have an impact from that much of a volume growth we’ve identified clearly areas that we’ve got to get closer and diagnose the issue in terms of the train speed we’ve identified some pinch points but really will do the same thing we always do that’s use an integrated team approach use all the resources we have and really look at the existing plan and infrastructure and go from there in terms of just pure productivity our focus is on trainload on how we handle cars and costs to put them through yards whether it’d be minimal yard or whether it’d be switching yard those things never change and that’s something that’s always right front center of us if that helps answer any questions you have cherilyn radbourne that’s my one thank you jeanjacques ruest thank you luc jobin thank you cherilyn operator thank you the next question is from scott group from wolfe research please go ahead scott group hey thanks good afternoon everyone so i don’t know if this is for luc or ghislain i just want to ask more broadly kind of the way the model is working so there’s the second quarter in a row where revenue growth outpaced operating income growth and is there in your mind something unusual the past two quarters just given either something on the cost side or just that magnitude of the revenue growth or is this maybe we should think about the model going forward and maybe more as we kind of look to the back half of the year when revenue and volume growth decelerate into tougher comps should we still think about operating income growth growing slower than revenue growth or do you think we should go back to maybe the normal way of thinking about rails where you see some operating leverage and operating income growth exceeds revenue growth i know a long question but hopefully you luc jobin yes scott thanks for the question it’s luc listen we don’t think that there is any significant change it’s really a question of mix and how much business is coming onboard in addition to that there are occasionally onetime items that can cloud a little bit the new analysis so we still think that the historical model does work from time to time what will happen is you’re bringing on board a significant amount of volume so in that sense your incremental margin is not going to be even and progressive so i think that’s a little bit of what we’ve seen but if you take a step back and look at the first half of the year our incremental margin is probably sitting around  or something like that and we look at the back half of the year mike is in a good position to continue to improve on the operating metrics and we feel pretty good that we can see potentially a little bit more operational leverage kicking in so the nature of the mix – and the nature of what we’re bringing on a lot of it is been long haul business unit train and in many cases customer cars so that also will tend to create some noise in terms of – if you’re looking at the revenue yield versus the operating profit yield but we feel comfortable that there is no fundamental change in the model and the way we look at the balance of the year in the way forward ghislain houle and i – and scott this is ghislain i would also say that as in my remarks that we had a little bit of a spike up on a yearoveryear basis on incident costs by about  million so again that is reflected in the numbers but through emphasize luc’s point i think the model is working luc jobin thanks very much scott scott group all right thank you guys ghislain houle thank you operator thank you the next question is from turan quettawala from scotiabank please go ahead luc jobin go ahead turan turan quettawala sorry i was on mute good afternoon so i guess my question was on the fuel lag here i was wondering if you could talk about whether that has a benefit to you at all at end of the quarter and maybe there’s something that could benefit you in q and it’s going to be enough potentially at current prices to offset the fx impact ghislain houle yes turan it’s ghislain houle as i mentioned in my remarks fuel lag helped us  million or  in the second quarter and the third quarter very very small i would say we’re looking possibly at a positive lag at this year about  million so and there was nothing last year’s on a yearoveryear basis you could be talking about  in the third quarter turan quettawala great thank you very much ghislain houle thank you operator thank you the next question is from ken hoexter from merrill lynch please go ahead ken hoexter great good afternoon can you just maybe jj talk a little bit more about intermodal i think you mentioned a new regina container program for grain are you focusing converting bulk traffic over and away from the highway and maybe talk a little bit about the benefits of the tightening us truck market if you’re seeing that on growth opportunities yet jeanjacques ruest okay so the initiative in regina has to do with balancing the extension we have at prince rupert and deltaport to offer the shipping line a revenue that makes sense for them we need to offer them – is not only just a good destination but also some revenue on the way back and then southern saskatchewan there’s big growth on the specialty crop most of them are sold overseas a lot of them are sold in containers so two products we’re going to be offering in order to do that one is this summer raymonde logistics we will this transfer facility completed by the month of august in rupert it will be able to receive full unit train or specialty crops from anywhere in the prairies in the us the loading container at the port itself and by the summer  we will be able also to receive load container or specialty crop to be loaded in regina which is much closer to where products has being rolled regarding the question on trucking i guess it’s almost likely capacity and price – more price question we’re not really seeing yet the tightening of the marketplace in the highway at least on what we do which is mostly repeat contract business not truck business that’s actually driving price yet on domestic intermodal so at this point that’s – i guess it’s something to come but not there at this point if that helps ken ken hoexter yes does thank you very much jj jeanjacques ruest thank you operator thank you the next question is from steve hansen from raymond james please go ahead steve hansen yes good afternoon guys my question is on coal specifically we’ve seen a pretty significant mix shift of late that i think you described in remarks i’m just curious about your outlook here the net side in particular and some of the traffic is coming out of the northeast part of british columbia and what we should expect into the balance of the year or next year thanks luc jobin okay thank you steve so the canadian coal that we moved to west coast is mostly in met coal some term of also met coal we also do quite a bit of petroleum coke from northern alberta that’s – which is also in our coal result that coke is mixed in the whole result so those business where it’s tough ph coal from fort mcmurray or canadian coal from canadian coal mine in eastern alberta i would describe in the study so now we are cruising phase and the sequential volume will probably stay at this when it comes to us coal it’s whatever question mark for the fourth quarter so why we’re not sure yet how much growth we look at in fourth quarter in total is related to us coal it’s related to us grain and how that will find out because us crop doesn’t look fantastic and the crop in south america looks great they have a lot of a lot of product and we don’t know if we are going to be competing to move corn and soybeans to develop by unit train but we’ll – a lot of that will end up moving by barges on the mississippi since the mississippi barge rate are quite low steve hansen very good thanks luc jobin thank you operator thank you the next question is from brandon oglenski from barclays please go ahead brandon oglenski hey good afternoon everyone thanks for get me on i guess want to revisit scott question maybe in a different way when we were at the analyst day last month you guys focused a lot in the intermodal opportunity so i guess just thinking into next year if you’re going to see mix more from intermodal outgrowing rest of the business could this be a potential source of margin headwind as we would think about especially with the canadian dollar strengthening and could be  maybe a continuation of the things we’ve seen in  luc jobin yes thanks for the question brandon it’s luc listen again we don’t really see that as taking shape we’ve always said that the margin on the intermodal business is – on the average for the book of business so in that sense we don’t see a significant shift and again we’ve got the structure to actually take on the volume so we don’t foresee a significant change brandon oglenski okay thank you luc jobin thank you operator thank you the next question is from david vernon from bernstein please go ahead david vernon hey good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the question luc i wanted to kind of had a little bit on the same topic it does look to me like the incremental diffuser ph about favorable benefit of the pension and even a little bit of a currency you’re running closer to  and yet your volume growth is running at the high end that we’ve seen over the last  years what is that taking away the normal volume driven leverage you would expect to see if you’re getting price above inflation is kind of oil driven leverage i would just sort of expected a better operating income result luc jobin yes david let me take a step back and kind of walk you through this a little bit because this is a question that’s come up a couple of times and i think we want to make sure people get a clear sense of what’s going on a lot of the growth that we’ve had as actually been very much long haul business around coal around potash and frac sand and so on and so forth so it’s very good growth but it’s long haul it’s also as i mentioned earlier customer equipment so when you look at the revenue what you’re going to get is – you’re going to get a lower revenue yield so that’s not a factor of wheat pricing that is a factor of the revenue we charge for the book and haul business and a lot of it is unit train as well so that is – we have to this associate that from the cost structure because the pressure for moving that business is in fact lower you don’t have to pay for the car supply and we do have a very good margin on that business so in effect if you look at what’s happening in terms of the operating ratio and leave aside some of the noise which ghislain referred to which may happen from one quarter to the next and some cases you’ve got fx you’ve got fuel and you’ve got some of the casualty costs that can distort a little bit your quarterly numbers but on the whole as i mentioned earlier when you look at the first half of the year and our incremental or is  so we are not seeing a shift away from profitability what happens is the mix and the nature of the business we’re picking up is leading to very strong gtms and rtms and – but the revenue profile is different so i think that is something that certainly was present in the first half of the year probably we’re not going to see as much of that in the second half but there will be some so you kind of have to work your way through the nature and the mix of business and you have to look at other metrics not just your revenue yield to assess the quality of what we’re bringing on board in terms of growth as well as our efficiency numbers so when mike looked at some of the operational product revenue numbers again they’re solid when you compare against similar work levels and volume levels back to  so when you look at all of the other measures you should gain some comfort that there isn’t something going on here where we’re bringing on what i would describe as low quality growth that’s not the case and i mean again the team is very much focused and very – we want to bring in good business onboard but we also – as i said it can be lumpy so in this quarter we picked up a lot of business and so between the first quarter and the team – the first mission for the team is bring it on – make sure that the levels of the service are good and then we kind of look at grinding it out so we’re constantly looking for opportunities where we can not only lower the cost of servicing the business but it’s a matter of fact how can we enhanced the service levels so you will see that taking place and that is why i think a longer term we don’t feel that we turn – we have to turn business away we have confidence that we can do it – we don’t – and jj showed you with the pricing levels are so we are very thoughtful in pricing of business and attracting good business and then working it through to maintain the profitability levels that have made us the leading class one in the space so all that to say we feel pretty good about where we are and we’ll continue to crank out of these numbers on the way forward and probably you’ll see a little bit less of this pattern but it will still be some certainly in the second half of the year david vernon and maybe just as a quick followup to that as you think about grinding up is that a question of rewriting the contract or is it a question of maybe just getting it more ingrained in the operation and catching up a little bit on the productivity side luc jobin yes it’s not rewriting the contract trust me it’s the innovation it’s pushing the envelope i mean this is what mike and his team excel of doing day in and day out so it really is looking at – where and how can we improve as i said on two key dimensions that we always focus on efficiency and service and we – team’s mission and the team’s mandate is not to achieve one of the expense of the other so that’s what you have to look at and keep your eyes on the team that that’s what they do best david vernon thank you luc luc jobin thank you operator thank you the next question is from the chris wetherbee from citigroup please go ahead christian wetherbee hey thanks good afternoon i wanted to talk a little bit about the volume cadence in the back half of the year so i think you had a couple of comments about some of the things that could be variables particular to the fourth quarter but when you look at the rtm guiding your progress so far i guess i’m just curious what is the risk to the fourth quarter in terms of actually seeing negative rtms that maybe what are some of those major variables i am guessing grain and i think you mentioned us coal could also be part of it but it’s running in a sense maybe with some more detail about what’s in those moving parts could be in the q jeanjacques ruest so chris it’s jj when we get the fourth quarter one of the thing we’re unsure about at this point one is us coal us grain the crop but also what i move on the long haul railroad or short haul to the river sulfur is also a pressure mark for us either liquid or going to the us or dry going to the coast so it’s really typically is on the bulk side and potash uralkali and canpotex have both settled a contract with the chinese which means now the – all contract will be settled for all the countries but we don’t know whether or not we will have the same record potash move than we did last year in the fourth quarter which was very strong and by the way that’s an example of where mike as we written how we do business when we move this product train from saskatchewan to saint john we now move them  cars nobody moves a train of  in north america so it obviously your cost per unit is down and so we can compete on a lower cent per rtm and make money despite of that so the fourth quarter question mark is more about the bulk side and what on earth we will have – be below last year or surprise ourself and be as good i mean better than last year we feel more confident about the rest of the economy christian wetherbee but as it stands you got positive rtm in your model for the fourth quarter jeanjacques ruest yes some and then the place amount ph we have negative rtm is bulk related and the uncertainty about the commodity which i talked about luc jobin and clearly chris i mean it is tapering down there’s no question about that but we don’t – as jj pointed out we don’t see negative rtm growth but there is a tightening up that will take place in the fourth quarter so far the third quarter is looking good jeanjacques ruest yes first three weeks pretty good luc jobin so we’ll have to walk it home christian wetherbee yes great thank you jeanjacques ruest thank you operator thank you the next question is from konark gupta from macquarie capital markets please go ahead konark gupta thank you and good afternoon just a question on metals and minerals i guess frac sand iron ore and steel have driven the segment so far this year so where you see trends in those commodities in the second half in  is there any stickiness basically in the existing frac sand business if growth in drilling activity slows down more materially thank you jeanjacques ruest yes it’s jj so yes there is stickiness in the frac sand business we foresee frac sand sequentially stay at the rate where it is right now they eventually will have but we had a very strong second quarter frac sand and if it sequentially maintains that rate it’s very positive when you look at the mm metals and minerals category you have frac sand to that you have steel you have mineral you also have iron ore but the one that really is driving this category yeartodate is the frac sand and we believe the frac sand will hold luc jobin thank you konark operator thank you the next question is from benoit poirier from desjardins capital markets please go ahead benoit poirier yes good afternoon gentleman jj a lot of color about the currency impact on translation and also on the eps but when you talk to customers i was wondering if you could point out the strength of the canadian dollar whether you see some potential impact on some commodity and whether it makes the canadian ports losing some of their competitive advantage so talking about grain coal forest product whether it could impact some volume in the longer term jeanjacques ruest yes thank you benoit so it’s still early on it’s well a couple of cents maybe up to  and i don’t know if the canadian dollar will go up from this point for stay where it is no i don’t think – we don’t have customers at this point where those   is going to have a material impact from their sales to the united states with sales abroad frankly at   canadian that was quite weak too so one would not think the canadian economy had to arrive such a weak dollar i think at this point i mean it’s not huge change a couple of cents probably point of view of our customers in their production cost benoit poirier okay thanks for the color luc jobin thank you benoit operator thank you the next question is from brian ossenbeck from jpmorgan please go ahead brian ossenbeck hey good afternoon thanks for taking my question so ghislain going back to the investor day you said the cost of positive train control would increase and it wouldn’t be a small number so mike mentioned hiring some people for technology and ptc and where does the opex and da stand related to that system right now and where do you expect that to settle out when everything is on line call it  the first half subdivisions done in  when everything is wrapped up ghislain houle yes thanks brian yeah ptc this year i think what we’re looking at is possibly about  million a third of that would be depreciation and in terms of the future years i think we’re not going to provide guidance for the future years i think we’re very focused and the team is very focused on delivering and we’re in the thick of it and we’re advancing so it’s good and we’ll see and frankly we need to deliver ptc first before we know once we’re there how much it’s going to cost us to support it but we know this year that it will be  million a third of it is depreciation brian ossenbeck okay thanks for the color ghislain houle thank you operator thank you the next question is from justin long from stephens please go ahead justin long thanks and good evening i know it may be a little bit early for this question but i was wondering if you had any thoughts or expectations on this year’s peak season just given some of your port capacity expansion projects i thought you might have an early read so i’m curious what you’re expecting and what’s baked into your guidance for the back half of the year jeanjacques ruest justin it’s jj i think for us for this year especially this year the fact that rupert’s capacity should be available to all of us by late august and the deltaport sometime in the fall might be more relevant than the fall peak at south because now we have the ability to access a lot of capacity and the question will be what are now rtm dp world ph and gct collectively would be able to sell some of that as early as august september october november so we are planning for significant growth and obviously that’s our model all related to fall peak but more about the capacity available to us and all the premarketing that we did about the service that we collectively offer including the service that we have in south of vancouver which really helps be a huge help to us in the last six months justin long okay great but maybe just to follow up as you stripped out that capacity addition that you have planned does it feel like the underlying demand environment as it relates to peak will improve issue relative to last year jeanjacques ruest i wouldn’t say so no i don’t think the peak this year will be of a different trend or bigger than last year but the canadian economy right now is doing fairly good so i mean the consumption by the canadian consumers and the us midwest and us midamerican consumers seems to be solid and good and obviously we benefit from that as well justin long okay great i appreciate that jeanjacques ruest thank you operator thank you the next question is from allison landry from credit suisse please go ahead allison landry good afternoon thanks thinking about the guidance for the  rtm growth you’re just basically implying a fullyear number which is i guess slightly above the peak that you saw in  so are you at the point where you’re basically really needing to think about ramping up resources and is it fair to say that you’re potentially approaching capacity levels mix i know is a factor but in any way you could help us think through this would be helpful thanks ghislain houle yes allison this is ghislain from a resource standpoint we do and we are hiring i mean if you look at the end of q  versus the q  we added about  people and our labor productivity in terms of million gtms per employee was up  when you look at the end of q versus the end of q we’ve added another  people and again our employee productivity was up  so we are adding people we said we were going to do that and we have to do that a little bit in advance because there is a lead time to train these folks whether it’s our crews or whether it’s engineering or mechanical folks so we’re trying to be ahead of the game but obviously as you can see from these statistics we are we are not adding one for one so we are absorbing and then i’ll ask mike to settle in on capacity mike and i and jj are connected very closer to hip we’re looking at volumes coming we’re always working together to see potential pinchpoints where they are and we want to be ahead of the game we want to be investing before it happens but we don’t want to do that too early either so we are currently investing to support our intermodal – business we are investing to support our growth in frac sand from a capacity standpoint we will continue to look at this and do that next year so i think that it’s a lot of volume coming at us so we’re pleased about the work that we’ve done we’re pleased about the fact that we’ve been able to absorb and we’ll continue to absorb some of that volume and we’re pleased about the fact that we’re trying to stay ahead of the game in terms of our investment mike cory and i can’t add a whole lot and ghislain said most but i’ll refer to what luc was talking about allison we really – we clearly diagnose whatever the issue may be that’s creating what we might see to be a pinchpoint and before we spend we look internally whether it’s infrastructure we already have whether it’s some innovative way to approach it but that’s been our template for a long time and that will continue but to ghislain’s point we know the areas that we’ve seen extreme growth we know the areas that we’ve seen train speed drop to a degree we definitely come together as a group and we’ve identified lot of things we’re going to do and we’ll see where that takes us and we’ll do what we have to do in order to service the customer the way they expect and need and the way we need to keep the cost down luc jobin and allison just to put icing on the cake here you’re getting all – three for one i would say – it’s luc i would say that what we constantly do is we triage and we prioritize where we see the most leverage and the most opportunities for deploying capital so that is always – what we’ve talked about is within the scope of our capital envelope and what we do is we prioritize depending on where and how we see the opportunity so you shouldn’t expect a significant shift in the profile of our capex over time it should be in line with what we’ve described at the inventor day thanks for your question allison allison landry all right thank you luc jobin thank you operator thank you the next question is from david tyerman from cormark securities please go ahead david tyerman yes so just following up on the comments on hiring so should we expect hiring to continue at  to  people additional or does it slowdown quite a bit as the volume growth slows down ghislain houle listen i think i’m not going to give you david a specific number what we are going to do is continue to – we will hire we were looking at what’s ahead of us but we’ll not hire one for one so that’s the key and we’re going to continue to absorb some of that volume with the service and the operations that we have so david tyerman okay thank you luc jobin thanks david all right well thank you for the questions obviously we’re very pleased and we’re very proud of our second quarter results i think they continue to support what we have been doing for several years in terms of advancing our strategy and gaining traction in the marketplace and we continue to see future growth ahead of what the base markets can bring to us we’ve got a lot of good initiatives going on our offering in the marketplace is resonating with customers so we feel good about our ability to attract and retain and work through efficiently work through the business that we’re bringing onboard so a good quarter a very good quarter actually when you look at these numbers and i think the year is shaping very well and again we’re restating our guidance and we’re staying – in spite of some of the changes in currencies and other little headwinds we’re staying the course so we’re looking forward to bringing you up to date when we have our third quarter call and in the meantime thank you for joining in and we’ll see you later mike cory thank

president investor relations ladies and gentlemen mr butcher paul butcher thank you greta good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today i would like to remind you of the comments already made regarding forwardlooking statements with me today is luc jobin our president and chief executive officer mike cory our executive vice president and chief operating officer jj ruest our executive vice president and chief marketing officer and ghislain houle our executive vice president and chief financial officer as to our prepared remarks we will conclude with the question and answer session in consideration of your time we are trying to keep this call to one hour and i will ask that you please limit yourselves to one question i will be available after the call for any followup questions it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to cns president and chief executive officer luc jobin luc jobin thanks very much paul and let me in turn welcome all of you to cn’s quarterly call today we will review our results for the fourth quarter and the full year  the cn team is pleased to report another very strong quarter one that cast the solid year of performance both financial and operating including significant improvement in terms of safety service and productivity these results continue to show how cn is adapting to changing market conditions ceasing opportunities every day whilst positioning for the future we achieved strong results in the fourth quarter with an adjusted diluted eps of  and that’s up  versus last year’s fourth quarter we also saw positive momentum on volume with rtms up  that’s an encouraging sign that the worst of the market correction in several commodity sectors is behind us and brighter prospects lay ahead jj will give you more color on this in a minute in terms of operating performance we delivered very good metrics despite a more difficult winter in december of last year looking at full year results we are very proud of our performance especially given how challenging the year has been from a market standpoint and so for  we achieved a full year adjusted diluted eps growth of  to stand up  we also delivered a recordbreaking operating ratio of  that is a full  basis points better than last year it’s very tough to achieve this level of results and the entire cn team deserves credit since we accomplish this with a clear view to meet high service levels and supply chain collaboration but not undermine our ability to grow as the market improves mike will give us a good look at how innovation productivity and teamwork has been instrumental in reaching this milestone in  cn generated free cash flow of  billion up  versus last year and last but not least we announced today a  increase in our dividend later on the call ghislain will expand on other key financial metrics for q and the full year as well as provide you with our earnings guidance for  along with some key assumptions let me now turn it over to the team for their more detailed commentary starting with mike cory mike mike cory well thank you luc the cn team of professionals deserves accolades for achieving very good results for the fourth quarter in spite of the impact of december’s winter comeback story i’ll go into further detail on the subject of winter a little later on the full year basis the overall results were outstanding and they reinforce a supply chain approach this is an approach that produces premium service at the lowest possible cost by understanding the customer demand in executing our operations to efficiently deliver it on a fullyear basis all of our key operating metrics see previous records with the exception of train speed train speed was slightly down since our record performance of  however volume is up  and trains are carrying  more payloads since that time period for q workload and are measuring this in gtms we were up  in q and up  from q of  in q we set an alltime record for train productivity at  tons per train which is  higher than last year’s q we also set a q record for locomotive utilization which was up  yearoveryear all this was accomplished against the very tough comparable with a significant headwind of winter in december that we do not experience last year in fact going back over the last five years the month of december  was the second coldest with more days colder than minus  degrees celsius than any other period for one year as well the snowfall we experienced was the second highest in the last five years and our major operating yards in winnipeg recorded the highest level of snowfall in the history of the city considering the dramatic change in weather this december brought our response was swift and it ensured our game plan of operational and service excellence remained intact in fact i can objectively say that in my  years in this industry and you have to remember a good majority of thats been in operations in western canada we have not performed this well in the type of winter conditions we were faced within december in all of my recollection we were able to deliver these results because our focus is on two tracks and the first track is really about the daytoday management of our business we focus intensely on our metrics our attention to detail is second to none and continuous improvements if you will lead us to meet the demand of our customers efficiently the other track is aligned to the future we invest time and capital to continue to create more efficient solutions for customers in turn we create reliability efficiency and business growth in the long term this track allows for innovation that produces results our investments in assets like ac locomotives network and yard improvements technology to reduce the impact of weather and increase our service offering for customers have created an environment of innovation and i’ll tell you that environment is something our team takes full advantage of our alignment with jj and his team on developing and delivering a series of superior product offering constraint supported by investments in both network and locomotive capacity has produced by far the best movement of grain and not only over a winter period but a reigning period in recent history this alignment trends in across all business segments and allows for a clustering of innovation and ideas that continue to drive our results now i said it before but no one metric generates these results on its own it’s all about balance and we believe our model of operational service excellence with a view to the future is what delivers results that are best in class one last point of thanks to our operating team leaders they believe in and they deliver our plan they sacrifice for their teams and they create the environment that allows this success to happen so we have work to do but good work is being done over to you jj jeanjacques ruest well thank you mike great operating results by the operating team of cn the fourthquarter revenue of cn was up  million or  versus last year the cn carload was up  the revenue ton mile was up  both were above the industry average q was broadly as follows revenue increase from volume was about  our most positive business for canadian and us going market share gain and refined petroleum products and automotive us housing start was driving our lumber and panel our intermodal from the east coast did well and finally we had recovery in canadian export of pet coke and potash on the negative side less long haul of crude by rail less us terminal coal and less sulphur the applicable fuel surcharge lowered our revenue by about  and the allin same store price on same store sales was up  when excluding the regulated grain same store price was up  the canadian dollar had no impact on revenue this past quarter i will now go through some selected details and outlook of our very diversified portfolio starting with grain our grain operation was very fluid as my partner mike just described earlier we did a great job especially in december which meant that for us grain that when i look at the as reported q our carload we were up  cars and the revenue reported revenue was up  or  million this was driven by soybean and corn export on the canadian grain when you look at it on the as reported on the q aar carloads we were also up about  cars these are longer haul and the reported revenue was up  or  million this was driven by strong export of canola and by all peak season pricing program we had solid carload performance during the month of december where the prairie was very cold and which is really the result of past capital investment in our network that we can now benefit and really and as mike described is a strong team operation of winter preparation but also in partnership with our grain customers under aar q carloads we move  cars of canadian grain which is notably  more than our counterparts the future of our grain franchise and grain market share is to grow we do have better yield for acreage there is more acreage being planted and we do have a number of commercial agreement already in place with customers that were located on cn about two third of the next wave of prairie elevated construction in the next few years staying with bulk commodities potash produced  incremental revenue while sulphur from oil and gas declined  q outlook for potash carloading is positive for canpotex export via vancouver but is also positive at these coasts where we use our new  ton unit train to the saint john potash terminal overall core revenue for cn and total was down  our us terminal core revenue was down to note effective january  we lost a short haul midwest utility contract that in  was worth  million canadian for cn and business about  carloads these were short haul carloads on the flip side canadian met coal was up  versus last year but the volume trends have turned around cn and the met coal have increased their production in response to better oil pricing three of our idle canadian coal mine were acquired by the company called conuma one mine did restart and is now in full production and conuma is looking to restart the second mine this year we also have two other idle mine in cn which are also under restart consideration our met coal and pet coke exports should be growing in  housing starts drove our lumber and panel revenue which was up  versus last year the lumber and panel shipment to the us increased  the expiry of the softwood lumber agreement october  had little impact on our car orders which remained consistent during the quarter and into this month driven by us housing start in the range of  million units per year moving to customers purchase of motor vehicle our automotive as reported on the q ar carload was up  cars and on a reported revenue basis were up  vehicle sales were favorable and we also gained new business from a few contract renewal this year in  we expect our automotive carload to grow and cn is now touching close to  of all the finished vehicles sold in canada regarding energy our carload for crude by rail was about  for the past quarter and  carload for  crude has sequentially improved during the fourth quarter we also had share gains in refined petroleum products such as propane and motor fuels which produced solid revenue growth which should continue in the first quarter on frac sand our revenue was up  the resurgence in drilling activities have sequentially improved sand carloads during the fourth quarter intermodal revenue was up only  domestic volume growth was modest mostly coming from doortodoor service from our industrial carload customers as well as from the canadian retailers the hub to hub wholesales and cross border business stayed weak with the growing numbers of shipping line partners now doing business with cn we had a much bigger pool of international containers at our disposal this year to grow our domestic repo program as the international volume was flat and rupert after hanjin filed for bankruptcy in september we are well aware  well on the way to recover the volume with other shipping line especially with the dp oil terminal expansion coming soon in july and the reshaping of the world shipping line alliance which will come into effect sometime in may in vancouver all of our major contracts are renewed starting this month we picked up the indiscernible business and mike’s team is putting new service in place for the container business offloaded at vanterm and centerm terminal solving the congestion issues also notable at the end of april we will see a final phase of the railyard construction at deltaport which will create  more rail capacity than what’s available there today on the east coast our halifax position in the indiscernible is growing revenue growth was about  in the fourth quarter the port of montreal is also doing well growing  one team that we are very very proud and we want to emphasize is how the team we are going to supply chain partners is all of us to be able to grow these businesses rail volume from the gulf coast is still building very slowly and one other thing to add is we will be adding an incremental ramp in minnesota sometime in the first quarter finally iron ore our combined iron ore rail dock and vessel business increased  in revenue in the last quarter the outlook for iron ore is positive there is less field being dumped in the united states there is strike in auto manufacturing there is prospect for us infrastructure spending and the capex expenditure from the oil and gas industry is getting healthier in closing we had the constructive volume given the momentum we saw since last september which has been sustained in the first weeks of this year we are aiming to outperform the rail industry average as it relates to volume growth on the pricing side the pricing environment remain influenced by excess capacity in all mode of transportation however we are seeing some early signs of tightening and discipline we continue to expect pricing to be above rail inflation in  thank you i think i will turn it over here to ghislain our chief financial officer ghislain houle thanks jj starting on page  of the presentation i will summarize the key financial highlights of our solid fourth quarter performance then i will comment on our full year  performance and finally i will provide our guidance for  as jj previously pointed out revenues for the quarter were up  versus last year at slightly over  billion fuel lag on a yearoveryear basis represented a revenue headwind of  million or  of eps driven by an unfavorable lag this year of  million versus a favorable lag of  million experience in q of  operating income was just shy of  billion up  million or  versus last year our operating ratio came in at  a record for fourth quarter and representing an improvement of  basis points over last year other income was  million compared to  million in  this increase is the result of the gain on aligned sale in montreal of  million or  million after tax net income stood at  million or  higher than last year with reported diluted earnings per share of  versus  in  up by  this includes the gain on the one time aligned sale i just mentioned thus excluding this gain adjusted diluted eps for the quarter came in at  up  or  versus last year the impact of foreign currency on an income eps was negligible in the quarter turning to page  as mike previously pointed out we continued to make progress in the quarter in terms of productivity gains including cost management initiatives while providing superior service our operating expenses were up  versus last year at just over  billion mostly driven by higher volumes versus last year as the average exchange rate in the fourth quarter of  was essentially the same as last year both actual and constant currency variances are the same labor and fringe benefit expenses were  million  lower than last year this was mostly the result of lower wages and pension expense partly offset by higher incentive compensation wage costs decreased by  as wage inflation was more than offset by a reduction of about  in average head count for the quarter versus  at the end of the year we still had about  employees laid off and we finished  with  fewer employees or roughly  less than last year pension expense was  million favorable this quarter ending the year with a higher than expected tailwind of  million mostly driven by the adoption of the spot rate approach to estimate current service cost and interest costs as interest rates moved up since the third quarter and the discount rate finished at  at december  pension expense will be roughly flat in  versus  on a yearoveryear basis finally these items were partly offset by higher incentive compensation of  million in the quarter versus last year purchase services and material expense were  million  lower than last year this was mostly the result of higher credits driven by our capital program and lower repair and maintenance costs partly offset by higher outsourced services fuel expense came in at  million or  higher than last year mainly attributable to stronger volumes partly offset by fuel productivity which was up by  versus last year depreciation stood at  million  higher than last year this was mostly a function of net asset additions equipment rents were down  versus last year driven by lower lease expense due to return of lease cost finally casualty and other cost was  million which was  million higher than last year mainly driven by our annual actuarial trueup for legal claims of  million and a workers’ compensation credit of around  million recorded in q  let me now turn to our full year results on page  we completed  with revenue slightly above  billion or  lower than  however our operating expenses at around  billion were  lower than last year producing a  increase in operating income versus  the operating ratio stood at an impressive  which as luc indicated is a full  basis point improvement versus our all time record of  set last year this demonstrates our continued ability to balance operational and service excellence consistent with our supply chain focus in good and tougher time net income was up roughly a  million were  at just over  billion excluding the impact of the one time line serve in  and income tax adjustments in both years adjusted diluted eps for  came in at  up  versus  quite a performance in an environment for volumes in terms of rtms were down  for the year now moving to free cash flow on page  for the full year  we generated just above  billion of free cash flow which is close to  million or  higher than in the prior year this was mostly driven by improvements in net income lower cash taxes and higher proceeds on sale of property our capital expenditure finished roughly at our budgeted  billion and our balance sheet remains strong with debt and leverage ratios well within our guide lines finally let me turn to our  financial outlook on page  we are cautiously optimistic with regards to cn’s prospect for the year and while we see volume growth in  we are continuing to experience some volatility and weaker conditions in a number of commodity sectors as we look into  north american economic conditions are improving with favorable consumer confidence which have support progress in many sectors in addition we are leveraging our superior service to continue to gain market share in key customer service sensitive markets while energy market mainly crude and frac sand have demonstrated sequential growth since trough experienced in the second quarter last year we still expect this sector to remain relatively muted in  so this environment should translate into volume growth in the range of  to  in terms of rtms with the full year versus  while overall pricing above inflation therefore we expect to deliver eps growth in the midsingle digit range over  adjusted diluted eps of  we remain committed to reinvesting in the business for the long run with the capital envelop of  billion for  we will allocate  billion for basic track infrastructure supporting our safety agenda and an investment of around  million will be allocated to ptc as we continued to advance the implementation of a program furthermore we continue to pursue our shareholder return agenda in  we return to shareholders roughly  of our net income through dividends and repurchases in our current share buyback program is approximately  billion in  finally we are pleased to announce as luc mentioned that our boards of directors have approved a  dividend increase for  reflecting our solid performance in  and our confident in the future as we move toward a  dividend payout ratios in closing we’ll remain committed to our agenda of operational and service excellence with our supply chain focus and we continue to manage the business to deliver sustainable value for our customers and shareholders today and for the longterm on this note back to you luc luc jobin all right well thank you very much ghislain jj and mike i think what we’ll do now is we’ll turn we’ll open the lines to take your call so we are now ready to take the calls questionandanswer session operator thank you mr jobin we will take questions operator instructions the first question is from wayne mcdonnell of cn please proceed unidentified analyst that was a mistake there are no questions i was just listening to the call luc jobin all right thanks operator thank you very much the next question is from brandon oglenski of barclays please proceed brandon oglenski hey good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question so luc or jj can you just give us some feedback obviously the landscape or at least the future landscape for nafta has change a little bit with the us elections have you gotten any feedback from your customers i mean has anything structurally changed yet and are you rethinking your capital allocation process i mean when you think about some of the assets that are involved in north america trade especially some other railroad stocks and valuations have come down a lot now does that make you think strategically a little bit differently about the outlook luc jobin yes thanks brandon for your question well just talking little bit about nafta i mean again from the canadian perspective we are cautiously optimistic again we’ve been long trading partners with the united states and theres a lot going on and there is a certainly a relationship which is very different between canada and the us versus mexico and us so the balance trade is much more – a much closer and we also  when you look at the manufacturing jobs that moved they moved out of canada and out at the us and in many over to mexico so if you look at what might be more affected certainly the automotive sector both parts and new cars with the potentially at the crosshair of that but that’s a very small percentage of what we actually export to the us southbound so we don’t expect any significant change i sees not in the foreseeable future and i think most of our customers and jj can supplement are taking the same sort of optimistic yet cautious approach and we’ll have to work things out but generally what weve been hearing from the us folks is encouraging and we’ll have to kind of work through it there is free trade agreement which predate nafta and so there’s a longstanding relationship of bilateral negotiations and working out issues as it relates to how this may affect other railways at this point it hadn’t necessarily changed our views i think its still too early to call the game and so we’re going to have to see how things evolve and where the dust settled in the end jj anything you want to add in terms of any jeanjacques ruest yes that’s been my opening comments we are constructed about the volume outlook we are aiming to outperform the rail industry average and after three weeks were leading with  carload growth and also we look at the us i mean we got about  or so percent of our business which is domestic us brandon so i think there are plenty of opportunities for us to grow as potentially more manufacturing and more jobs get created in the us so we’re looking forward to that thank you brandon oglenski no problem operator thank you the next question is from walter spracklin of rbc please proceed walter spracklin very much good afternoon everyone jeanjacques ruest how you’re doing walter walter spracklin so i guess the most common question i get is on your or improvement in and how you can get much lower and it seems to be the question that recurs every year and you do deliver on that so i guess ill ask it again mike youve got and you’ve demonstrated some significant trends and improvements that seem to look like they’re going to carry forward in the next year look you talked a bit about technology investment is there any sense is our improvement in the cars for next year and can you give us some insights into what your assumption is for or that the drives your current eps guidance mike cory this are the tough one walter we can never answer it seem so i’m going to give you this i’m going to give you four points that are basic to what i would say fundamental success in railroading the first thing that we focus on is understand what we’re trying to accomplish from that we set plans that have targets that require improvement whether we put one less asset into the plan one less person whatever it is we set very tough target and then we measure them religiously and when we see something we take action immediately now thats all i’ve done with strong leadership the sacrifice i talked about that will get strong work that’s we’ll strong war we’ll never stop doing that the thing is the investment the item of the future technology we have everything in the works we just expect to continue to improve on not to or but every aspect of the business that we go after luc jobin yes thanks mike and walter i mean it’s always a balancing act i mean what try to is be as productive as we can and as mike pointed out to drive down costs where we’re not see necessarily adding the whole lot of value the flip side is we are set on gaining traction in the market place so we’re not shy about if we see opportunities and we want to invest a little bit and getting that business on board we can do so our low or allows us some flexibility and our confidence that we can continuous improvement that we can bring on new business and drive it to a level of productivity that’s our strength and so all that to say we’re not going to guide on ore and we’re always trying to solve for what’s the best bottomline and sustainable growth that we can bring on the network and it will bounce around a little bit given sometimes you’ll have weather that comes into play and at a times you’ll have a few other things that can cause it to bounce around but i think we just deliver and you can rest assured that team here is set on growing the business and doing so as efficiently as possible but not at the expense of more service offering and that’s the key that’s the magic to the equation here walter spracklin okay thank you very much luc jobin walter we look forward to the question next year walter spracklin thanks luc jobin all right operator thank you the next question is from ravi shanker of morgan stanley please proceed ravi shanker i want to followup on that question the risk of maybe asking the same question again in different way if i were to kind of try and bridge your topline guidance to your eps guidance it does look like you said  to  volume growth and pricing over inflation that by itself should get you to something close to mid singledigit eps growth not to mentioned as you said continuous or improvement and buyback on top of that i just want to make sure that there isnt something youre missing in terms of a headwind to earnings next year kind of below the line or at our lines itself luc jobin well i mean you’re not missing much i mean the reality is again i mean we set out and we look at – we have as much visibility than anybody else so we take a few and i think that what we’ve said is a fairly constructive view in terms of a number of commodity sectors seem to have stabilized and are showing encouraging signs of progress so the guidance that we’ve provided in mid singledigit is the reflection of what i would describe as that volume growth the pricing that we talked about and continuing to deliver solid operating metrics including or so that’s the equation and if you solve for that you get mid singledigit ravi shanker great and can just have one more on the shared gains you certainly had a very good recent track record with the picking up share where are we with that shift i mean do you think that’s kind of normalized between you and your chief peer or do you there are more opportunities out there thank you jeanjacques ruest there is more opportunity as geographic expansion or serving customers who are today we’d like to get a better service so now there i would not discount potential to – getting to which market but there is some business saw there that we think we could that maybe the customers would like to have business with us luc jobin thank you ravi appreciate it operator thank you the next question is from fadi chamoun of bmo capital markets fadi chamoun yes good evening just a clarification i’m not sure i said that does the guidance include a buyback for  and secondly for jj when you look at the whats going on with the new alliances ocean’s helping alliances do you feel unbalanced that this is something that creates opportunities for you to fill that incremental capacity on the west coast or does it represents more of a risk of this stage any visibility on that would be good ghislain houle hi fadi this is ghislain for your first question yes the guidance includes a  billion program for share buybacks in  but then jj if you want to say jeanjacques ruest yes fadi on the ocean shipping all the ocean shipping alliance will make into effect may st this is where all the musical chairs when the music stop and everybody has a different chair it does provides some kiosk in the marketplace if you wish from point of view at the same time in the case of rupert because the expansion is coming in june and july i’m sorry and we’ll have the second but it does provide opportunity we are selling what the hanjin and rupert right now very hard and in the case of vancouver with delta port having this rail on the capacity up a  by the end of april it also offered opportunity for us and our partners to go out and sell to for bigger ship bigger ship having bigger discharge and if the ship coming as a first part of call whereas vancouver it really gives us a great service to go and sell into market where our and to that market where market share today is suboptimal so lastly we were restricted the capacity i think this year we have an open field as of sometime in the spring and we are running hard to exploit all we can out of that fadi chamoun thanks very much ghislain houle thanks fadi operator thank you the next question is from jason seidl of cowen  company please proceed jason seidl thank you operator and thank you for taking the time i wanted to go back on pricing side i think earlier on you mentioned that things were starting to tighten up i was wondering if you can give us a little more color as to where you starting to see that and sort of are you starting reprice contract at a little bit better way than you thought you were luc jobin so i think there are few – the line was not that great your question was around pricing and pricing outlook getting slightly better is that right jason jason seidl that is correct yes luc jobin yes so definitely the last two years have been little more challenging than the years prior to that partly because the capacity of all more available we see i think on the trucking side there’s been less equipment been purchase the people have cut to vacant their capital expenditure on the rail side the capacity is going to be tightening this is where you’re going to get into commodity by commodity now railroad may have a lot of locomotive but they may no longer the specific type of gondola or specific type of rail equipment that a customer is looking for so this is where you start getting to the subsegment of i do have crews network capacity and i have locomotive but don’t have any more center beam or i don’t have any bilevel or on the trucking side i think people can only do so long at calling low price and year after cutting low price and then eventually start to get the result of what the living as a result of this low price so i think the discipline often comes back as a result of phases with some pain and then each market players i think would like to eventually slightly better price and each market players is also in some cases or at least in some equipment getting to the point we get to invest new capital money and now they look at it differently still longer in incremental sale it’s the sale has to pay for their newer railcar that they have to bring in jason seidl okay and how much your book of business is already priced at  luc jobin same as in the past we sign a multiyear contract and so we’re probably turning the book of business maybe like every three years or so jason seidl okay luc jobin thank very much jason seidl guys i appreciate the time operator thank you the next question is from tom wadewitz of ubs please proceed tom wadewitz yes good afternoon i wanted to see if you could offer within the volume growth guidance that you said three to four is there a mix effect that would be meaningful and then positive or negative that might kind of translate to revenue growth in a certain way and then i don’t know if  just a kind of little more color on that intermodal volume outlook it sounds like there was potential but it was kind of has been weak recently so any thoughts on those do appreciate it thank you luc jobin on intermodal we haven’t hit i will stride yet i think we were negative for a while and now we’re flat and we now hoping for better days to come in spring and summer time for the reason i mentioned earlier and yes i think the mix has changed quite a bit last shorthaul business been last longhaul business been gain longhaul crude disappearing long haul frac sand coming back in i think we’re going to some of that this year as well intermodal if it comes that’s fairly longhaul too but its slower weight and we talk about the expansion of delta port so right now on the mix side i’m not too sure exactly where it will go for this year and there’s a lot of  we’re not into steady in the environment we’re into bit of a recovery phase from a volume side but i think there is reason to be optimistic about volume for this year i think for the rail industry in general but definitely at cn tom wadewitz okay thank you luc jobin thank you tom operator thank you the next question is from steve hansen of raymond james steve hansen yes hey guys thanks for time if im looking at the volume growth side of things the strength that appears to be carrying over and q appears quite robust and if im looking at the pretty low hurdle in the q given last year’s turmoil it strikes me that your backend guidance assumptions are probably a little bit conservative or it strikes me that they are conservative any thoughts around sort of cadence throughout the year in terms of how the growth will progress in that  to  ghislain houle the first quarter last year we have tougher winter so this is really move all the volume we wanted to move but at time we get to the second quarter we were running very smoothly but the demand for our product was not that great you remember that the volume in q wasn’t that great and then it starts to pickup in the summer time and our fourth quarter volume last year it’s been pretty good so that’s kind of the cycle of what youll see but all in the guidance is volume that we talked about and one we’re sticking to it right now luc jobin and steve it luc just keep in mind i mean if you got better visibility on the second half and we do we’d be more than happy to share notes with you so at this point i think this is a fair annual guidance and as you indicated i mean we do expect to have stronger comps through the first half and then as the year unfold then if we see that the trends are evolving in a way that these are better or worst then we’ll readjust thing so but… ghislain houle we are cautious people i think last year everybody had different guidance we finished at  eps growth which in the end was one of the best in the industry steve hansen i appreciate the color thanks guys ghislain houle thank you operator thank you the next question is from scott group of wolfe research please proceed scott group hey thanks good afternoon guys so i wanted to go back just the or question so if i just take the pieces of your guidance with volume and price and buyback and earnings it does imply about a point or so maybe even a point or two or degradation this year so is that what youre telling us or maybe is there something conservative in the guidance or maybe something is changing or if you look in the fourth quarter rtms were up  and earnings were up  so maybe something is changing where you just not getting the operating leverage so how are you kind of answer that but the guidance does seem to imply or degradation this year and curious on your thoughts luc jobin yes scott its luc just to give you a little bit more color i mean one of the issue that you still have to keep in mind is that we did have a fairly mild winter and when we look at the last year so that’s not a godgiven right and even though people talk about global warming we’re certainly facing more what i call the more normal winter in fact a little bit more than that if you look to how decembers came up in any event so i think there is a little bit of noise there in terms of where and how the year will unfold from a pure costs standpoint and i think again we take a cautious view of sort of the second half in terms of volume so the numbers are there and it’s in the zone so it’s still too early to say whether our or will determine or not there isn’t anything thats going on that is particular it will be again i mean it will be a question of mix it will be question of when and how the volume is layered on certainly you can expect that will continue to manage the cost very tightly and continue as the mentioned earlier to seize opportunities where we can and we are prepared to invest a little bit more and take on business that maybe at a slightly higher or that’s the right thing for the franchise for the longterm so i think the precision you’re looking for is not what we do focus on i mean what were doing is we get there we got a good operating plan we got a good commercial plan and every time there is an opportunity we look at it and move on it so it could be just as much in terms lowering costs increasing productivity or putting on more business so you are in the zone but we’ll have to see how it shakes out scott group okay and that’s helpful if i can ask jj just one clarifying point so i think you said price was up  and fuel was down one but total carload yields were down too so that implies like a three to four point headwind for mix and carloads and rtms were pretty similar so what am i missing on the mix headwind this quarter jeanjacques ruest so on the samestore price it was  and i want to add if i remove the regular grain it was  the difference between these two assets because we do have peak pricing on our grain business that we start october st and what you’re referring to is the impact of the mix now we lost we lost from longhaul business versus the year before and crude by rail has also been shift in our frac sand which is also long haul the indiscernible business was flat so there’s a lot of mix noise in our mix result which impact these revenue tonmile and these revenue per carload but when we’re already managed the business we don’t manage the business on those matrix we manage it on samestore price we manage on revenue to cost ratio contribution per carload revenue roi on equipment and then also we have the impact on exchange and fuel on this revenue ton mile and revenue per carload so you’re looking at data that in the end is not really that useful to understand our yield the element that we use and the one i mentioned the one i listed here scott group okay thank you jeanjacques ruest okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from indiscernible of scotia bank please proceed milan posarac hi there this milan posarac online for tron just wondering capex been coming down here last couple of years and you’re guiding for a small decline in  as well so volume is recovering a bit here in  should be expect capex then to resume its upward trajectory in  or do you think you’ll have a little bit of a longer holiday thanks ghislain houle well this is ghislain so absolutely capex as i guided was  versus  last year we did say that we had locomotives in  that we were not expecting in  so that helped reduce the envelope offset a little bit by an uptick on the ptc investments going forward i think we’ve been very consistent on our investment and capital program i think we’re always going around  of revenues or close to  of operating income back to the business so in my view if i were you i would not assume anything otherwise i think in that ranges is the range of we’re looking for luc jobin yes milan its luc i mean we obviously are looking whenever we can see opportunities to invest and to further advance our competitive advantage we’re not shy about doing that so our eyes in the longterm and as we move forward we have indicated that there may be some opportunities more on the technology side and so we’re looking really hard and we’re not shy about investing we do have a good track record of delivering returns on capital investments so that’s of a posture on that milan posarac okay great thank you luc jobin thank you operator thank you the next question is from ken hoexter of merrill please proceed ken hoexter great good afternoon nice job on the quarter and tough weather spike it sounds like but clearly impacted a punch of peers for that reason i guess was there any reason for casualty spike it was the highest level since the fourth quarter level since  just i guess technical question following on scotts cost side but just a longerterm picture that the thoughts our large wins your big revenue wins with the gm business yang ming should we look at this says is the pricing side is as you asked before is there a capacity need whats driving those wins i’m just wondering i guess there were large expectation some of that would move back to your peer but when you keep winning like this it just wondering it that just service or is it pricing luc jobin so ken i think there’s two sides of your question to make sure so the first one is one casualty and other and the second one is market share so i’ll tackle the first one and i’ll let jj tackle market share so the first one i explain what happen on in the fourth quarter that explain that variance of  million it’s really an annual throughout that you do with our us legal claims and about  million was another  or that was a credit in last year when you look at casualty and others sometimes they’re lumpy items that come in a quarter if you want to look at a run rate i think we’ve said in the past that  million give or take in a quarter is a good number and that’s what i would use going forward but sometimes depending on what happens in certain quarters you might have a lumpy piece hitting like the one that we have on the fourth quarter jj you want to talk about the market share please jeanjacques ruest yes so when you look and see accounts like general motors or kia or mazda or yang ming that they are in the world where service is very key for their own success and i think mike cory in his opening comment said it right our aim to produce a premium service at the lowest operating ratio and that’s supplychain so our mindset is to try to put ourselves and issues of this company especially those who are face where in a world where service does matter automotive and delivering to warehouse and assembly plant and retailers and try to create supplychain that starts before cn and finished after cn so we’d become relevant for them and that’s how we – customers dont change from one supplier to another without good reason everybody obtain which are things are running well why we’ll make a change so it starts probably with a some level of dissatisfaction and then looking at something thats more appealing and having little taste of it because we do business with all these people we were doing business with all of these customers we’re just going to be doing more of it and our job is to help them win in their market and that’s the reason why they’d like to little more with cn where are pile of – pile of the extension of their success so and of course people want to pay a fair market price and having the lowest operating ratio in the industry allow us to compete when we want to ken hoexter very helpful appreciate the insight from both thank you luc jobin thank you ken operator thank you the next question is from david vernon of cormark securities please proceed david vernon hello two questions please one is just on headcount could you give us your thoughts on that and the second is on tax rate can you give us your thoughts on tax rate for  both effective and the cash stocks mike cory hi david it’s mike here look we modulate our labor based on demand demographics productivity we have people still laid off in some crafts however we were very very strong planning process and alignment with the variety of functions finance marketing sales operations where we meet regularly and we have a good view of the future and then we modulate our labor like i said luc jobin and on the effective tax rate i think we had guided  at  and i would continue to use that same number for  and on the cash taxes we are still around the midteen level so that’s what i would use david dalman okay that’s helpful thank you luc jobin thanks david unidentified company representative thank you david operator thank you the next question is from brian koenigsberg of vertical research partners please proceed brian koenigsberg yes hi good afternoon actually just starting out with the point of clarification on the revenue ton miles on the release in the presentation it talks about  but if you look at your aar data it talks about that actually indicates our camp is up  can you just tell us what the difference is between those two ghislain houle so in our press release i think we are using the calendar month the calendar quarter which is start december start first of october to december  and the ar does not use the same period so this is why in my comment i did refer when i was talking arr data i was specifically saying that and think because a lot of developed people i see use the arr data to compare but this is where you get into – it’s not a quarter with  days like we have on the arr i think paul could probably explain that in more specific detail after the call ends brian koenigsberg okay thanks for that and can you talk a little bit on met coal i think you indicated to the other customer that was expanding some production there are possibly some others that could open up business again in  and maybe a little bit more color on that and how significant that could be to the extent these production ramps do happen luc jobin in the last quarter of last year the price of met coal coking coal started to go up as a result of the chinese production coming back we had customers who had lot of energy who had –was in bankruptcy situation he had three mines shutdown all of his assets were bought at a reasonable price by a company called canuma it did reopen one of the mine in november we intend to open another mine sometime in – probably in sometime in the first half may open a third one it will all depend how the price of coking oil move around the well if you have a very good color what the canuma game plan is they actually their ceo gave an interview on bnn where he explained all of his game plan how that have come together but all that to say that coking coal for cn well now should not be a negative headwind it should be something positive and that in itself is what i was talking about earlier all right thank you brian brian koenigsberg yeah thank you operator thank you the next question is from david vernon of bernstein david vernon hey guys thanks for taking the question i guess luc maybe from a bigger picture sort of strategy perspective as you guys are kind of operating on all cylinders in a decent volume environment is there a point we just start looking at other ways to enhance cash flow whether monetization of assets maybe looking at coal production with cp maybe looking at investing into adjacencies as this how critical is this for the board and could you give us a sense for what you would think would be sort of fair game for what you could do to supplement the excellent operating results with corporate action luc jobin yeah i mean thanks for your question it’s something that we are always looking at and the first opportunity we look at is opportunities for growth in terms of advancing our book of business and investing in the franchise so if there are opportunities for some coinvestment or helping one of our customers grow and investing along with them we look at these things in terms of coproduction again there these things are on the radar but they are very few that actually right now that we can look to that might be interesting so i don’t think there is a lot of potential there we always look at other opportunities whether it’s adjacencies or bolt on smaller rails to acquire so those again tend to be a little bit lumpy and we are cautious on adjacencies cause again you need to keep in mind we know what we do very well and unless we think that we can have a competitive advantage or improve our overall product by venturing into these things we are not presumptuous enough to say that we can do all things well in many cases what we’ve done as well is to have alliances in work supply chain and so we don’t necessarily need to own the asset but the way we work with our partners and scorecards and the way we work to improve the performance is clearly has paid off for us so we look at every opportunity to grow to continue to grow the franchise these things are – they are not linear in terms of when and how they come to us but rest assured we are looking and we are intent on growing this franchise but in the flip side we are good custodians of the shareholders money and we do look for good returns before we look at acquisitions specially when you are outside of our field of expertise okay thank you… david vernon is that maybe just as a quick follow up is there anything material that we should expect on asset monetization for next year or kind of runrate you’ll see how it goes luc jobin no i think from that standpoint ghislain referred to a little transaction that we were able to achieve by the end of the year we don’t expect anything of magnitude being out there having said that we are always looking at things and turning stones so maybe what typically you look at – part of  million sort of runrate from miscellaneous parcels and stuff ghislain houle yeah i would say about  million and to your point we always strive to find out things and sometimes things unfold in different ways during the year obviously if we find some on used asset that we can monetize we certainly will run after it but at this point in time i would say that we don’t have anything specific on the docket and i would assume about  million of small sales spread over the year basically david vernon very good thank you operator thank you the next question is from cherilyn radbourne of td securities cherilyn radbourne thanks very much good afternoon so a very strong operating quarter given the winter that you described a bit of slippage in terms of the train and car velocity i assume a lot of that is winter but if those to the metrics i was also curious whether there were some tradeoffs being made in order to achieve the improvements in train productivity and locomotive utilization you reported maybe you can just kind of talk a little bit about where you continue to unearth efficiency gains mike cory cherilyn its mike here winter has obviously had its impact and will continue till it’s over i said it before it’s really rebalanced all those metrics to produce first of all the service the customers demand and to jj’s point make sure that we are just not looking at our internal workings but we look at the entire supply chain and continue to grow that profitable business so you’ll see changes throughout the year we try to make the best decision again to grow the business at the most controlled price and give jj and the team the opportunity to make sure that we are leading the supply chain but really you’ll see those numbers fluctuate a little bit they are certainly not out of the range that they normally are there is no priority over either of them it’s just about the demand for the customer cherilyn radbourne great that’s all from me thank you mike cory thank you luc jobin thank you cherilyn operator thank you the last question is from chris wetherbee of citigroup please proceed chris wetherbee hey great thanks and thanks for squeezing me in here at the end a question on frac sand so i think jj you mentioned seeing some pick up there just want to get a sense of kind of how we think about  some of our internal views you were suggesting if you can step up in production just want to get a sense of kind of how you participate and maybe what that means to the mix of the overall business luc jobin so the drilling activities is up definitely i think it’s well reported in most part of the continent in the case of cn we participate in this same way as in the past that we have a destination franchise in alberta and bc where the drilling activity is also up example in the month of january so that’s frac sands coming from indiscernible long haul and we are competing with some local brown sand and then we also participate in other some shell play where we bring the unit train or into frac sand a chicago – we interchange with either eastern railroad or western railroad going south so it is a good story it has been sequentially up in the fall sequentially up in the fourth quarter we had a good start here to the year on the canadian side the people drill they love it when it’s cold so they can get in their much – heavy equipment on frozen ground and things don’t be surprised if things on the frac sand start to slow down sometime in the spring they call this during the break up after – the break up or after the when it gets really mushy or muddy and then there is a pause of a couple of weeks and then it restarts again so now it’s a positive story the price of crude and all of the technology of today is a decent outlook for anything which is fracing either for gas or oil chris wetherbee all right that’s helpful luc jobin thank you chris luc jobin so perhaps in closing to kind of recap first i need to say i am very proud of what the team has accomplished this year we certainly demonstrated and state our ability to deliver great results in a very challenging environment you heard jj describe how our volume outlook has now turned positive mike illustrated for you how the operating team continues to drive our agenda of operational and service excellence in leveraging innovation ghislain shared with you our financial performance came together in  its clean and it’s straightforward and you have received our annual earnings guidance for  which is calling for mid single digit eps growth so looking ahead we set out for  with a constructive view and while the environment remains somewhat mixed we do expect to see moderate volume growth then we’ll see how it unfolds one thing for sure with relentless focus on safety productivity and service our industry leading team is intent on delivering solid execution with continued focus on leveraging our superior customer service and our supply chain approach to help us gain traction in the market place we continue to reinvest in our business with a long term perspective and we are well positioned to deliver a continued share holder value so on that note we look forward to reviewing our first quarter

saw the benefit of added capacity to more experienced workforces line and terminal space and less unproductive assets in the mix train speed terminal dwell fuel and locomotive productivity all improved as a result so for context im using a similar volume period against the same infrastructure backdropactually my comparison of  isnt exactly that as workload or gtms were  less in  than they are in   is actually a truer comparison workload or gtm wise but we did make infrastructure improvements in   excuse me in  so im going to use  as an examplethe biggest driver of locomotive utilization and car velocity is train speed with the yearoveryear growth our train speed has declined and affected both of these metrics however in comparison to  again even though volumes were still  lower than this year we improved our velocity while matching both train speed and locomotive utilization we did this through an aggressive approach to increasing train size something that we will continue to focus onon the productivity front both our yard and train productivity improved over both  and  our plan to tackle train speed reduction is in place it includes both innovative approaches as well as improvements that will be made through capacity and safety investments our focus on efficiency and reliability will never wane with a longerterm plan to fundamentally change operations through technology automation and optimization the introduction of new operational and service systems will provide the opportunity for our customers to grow their markets efficientlyon the safety front we continue to build a greater understanding of risk awareness within our team were capitalizing on our strong relationship with our operating unions to ensure everyone genuinely looks out for each other our fra accident ratio did increase from  to  on a yearoveryear comparable while both those numbers are a continuous improvement over the last year run rate our accident costs this quarter while in line with previous years run rates were higher than in for injuries were slightly up over our ratio for last year comparing to the last year run rate though we continue to improve on the absolute number however productivity improvements that reduce human work hours have affected the ratioto all of us this slip is just not acceptable and regardless of volume increase and mix of employee experience we know that our most valuable asset is our people and we will correct thisoverall were working very hard to improve our safety record and i have a number of initiatives headed up by a newly developed and integrated teamso overall im very pleased with the teams performance in the quarter with the volume growth we definitely had challenging conditions to deliver these results its clear the team came through once again and im grateful for the opportunity to lead themwith that over to you jjjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident thank you mike and great job on moving all those crates today i will keep my comments to  highlevel topics i will start with a highlevel description of how we achieved success in the last quarter followed by last quarter major variance and i will close with recent progress on our commercial agendaso lets start with how we achieved success in the last quarter first we outperformed the economy our revenue was up  million or  above last year yeartodate our revenue was up almost  million or  above last year more precisely  millionwe also outperformed the rail industry cns aar carloads were up  versus the industry average of  in q yeartodate our carloads were up  above last year versus the industry average of also very important to us is to achieve broadbased diversified source of growth and to that point all of our business unit produced good growth this quarter on top of that  segment have had alltime record  company record namely international containers automotive finished vehicle and frac sand for oil and gas drillingfinally we generated samestore price above rail inflation at  for the quarter and  for yeartodatei will now highlight selected segments that produced the most variantsfrac sand as mike mentioned was up  total canadian grain carloads were up  container volume from vancouver south shore vanterm and centerm terminal were up a combined  potash carloads were up almost  automotive carloads were up  it is worth noting cn handle about  of all the finished vehicle sold in canada coal carloads were down  but revenue was up a solid  because of business mixthe port of montreal and halifax volume when combined were up  our volume for natural gas liquid plastic pellets and condensates were downthe canadian dollar and our fuel surcharge program versus last year were both positive tailwind to our reported revenues respectively  million for fx  million for the fuelnow i will highlight recent progress of our commercial agenda the new customers that we onboarded earlier this year are delivering solid growth the port of prince rupert created an alltime high rail volume in june a good omen for the upcoming  years sand product of blair wisconsin opened a new frac sand mine on cn and we expect another of our sand customers wisconsin propane company of hixton wisconsin to further increase production on cn as wellcrude volume bounced back from last years fort mcmurray fire but the last eastern canada refinery that was using crudebyrail will stop doing so sometime in late augustwhirlpool announced they will build a regional distribution center in our calgary logistics park which further progress our colocation strategy with distribution centers in intermodal but our strategy also applies to grain where we have a number of grain country elevators either as newbuild or expansion of existing elevators to be done by viterra cargill grainsconnect g ph ilta and the same colocation strategy also apply to export transload we have raymont logistics who are building a major grain transfer facility in rupert for the summercma the ocean shipping line will start a new service on the east coast at the port of saint john new brunswick further building our  coast strategic advantage and the case for the port of st john our strategic focus is on ocean container on coal supply chain business and on bulk export of potashthe new duluth minnesota container terminal is now in operation and we are also finalizing plan to have a container terminal service in regina by the  grain crop this is further advancing our overall strategy of increasing our geographic reach by adding new and more destinationand last but not least our technology business team which is now fully staffed is in full project development mode to digitize cn next generation of supply chain services and build a foundation of our future competitive edgein conclusion to wrap this up we had a good diversified quarter with a number of good business unit coming through with good result the economic outlook for q look constructive and were on track to the full year volume guidanceghislain do you want to pick it up from hereghislain houle canadian national railway company  cfo and evp thanks jj starting on page  of the presentation i will summarize the key financial highlights of our solid second quarter performance as jj previously pointed out revenues for the quarter were up  versus last year at slightly over  billionfuel lag on a yearoveryear basis represented a revenue tailwind of  million or  of eps mostly driven by an unfavorable lag in the second quarter of  of the same amountoperating income was slightly under  billion up  million or  versus last year our operating ratio came in at  or  basis point higher than last year fuel prices had no impact on the increase this quarternet income stood at  or  higher than last year with reported diluted earnings per share of adjusted eps was up  to  from a year earlier eps of  excluding the impact on deferred income tax expense from the enactments of changes in provincial income tax rates in both yearsthe impact of foreign currency was  million favorable on net income or  of eps in the quarterturning to expenses on page  as mike previously pointed out we continue to make progress in the quarter in terms of efficiency gains including disciplined cost management initiatives despite a significant increase in volumes our operating expenses were up  versus last year at just over  billion mostly driven by stronger volumes and higher incident costs expressed on a constant currency basis this represents a  increaseat this point i will refer to the variances in constant currencylabor and fringe benefit expenses were  million or  higher than last year as increased wages and incentive compensation expenses were partially offset by higher capital credits on a full year basis we still expect pension expense to be roughly flat versus last yearpurchase services and material expenses were  million or  higher than last year this was mostly the result of higher outsource services and repair and maintenance costs mostly driven by higher volumesfuel expense stood at  million or  higher than last year higher volumes accounted for a  million increase and price was an unfavorable variance of  million versus  fuel productivity was about  improvement in the quarter versus last yeardepreciation stood at  million or  higher than last year mostly as a result of net asset additionsequipment rents were up  versus last year driven by increased car hire partly offset by lower lease expense casualty and other costs were  million which was  million higher than last year mostly driven by higher incident cost of  million and an increase in environmental provision of  millionfor the balance of the year we can expect about  million to  million per quarter for casualty and othersmoving to cash on page  we generated free cash flow of  through the end of june this is  million higher than in  and mostly the result of higher cash generated from operating activities lower capital expenditures and lower cash taxesfinally our  financial outlook on page  we achieved solid volumes in the first half of the year reflecting strong performance across most segments we continue to see favorable economic conditions in north america including a stronger than expected canadian economy in addition consumer confidence remains positive while a strong energy sector is driving shipments of frac sand and steel pipescrude volumes are strong but this remains a spot business however we expect volume growth in the second half of the year to be more challenged as comparables with  will be more difficult particularly in the fourth quarter we believe this environment should continue to translate into volume growth of approximately  in terms of rtms for the full year versus  with overall pricing remaining above inflationwe have experienced  we had recently experienced the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar and assuming the current spot rate of around  this will create a headwind on earnings going forwardas a reference  appreciation in the canadian dollar versus the us dollar results in an annual headwind on net income of approximately  million or  of epsdespite the dollar headwind we are reaffirming our guidance and continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of  to  versus  adjusted diluted eps of  in fact should foreign exchange remain at  we could finish at the upper range  at the upper end of our rangeon the capital front we remain committed to reinvesting in our business to support safety service and growth in this regard we continue to target a capital envelope of  billion for the year and about  of revenues going forwardfurthermore we continue to reward our shareholders with consistent dividend returns and we are on track with our current share buyback program of approximately  billion having repurchased just over  million shares for  billion since last octoberin closing we remain committed to our agenda and continue to manage the business to deliver sustainable value today and for the long termon this note back to you lucluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director all right thank you ghislain so in closing let me add a few words looking ahead we hold a positive view of the economic environment and we expect to have volume growth in the second half although we will be facing some tougher comps versus last yearour strategy of leveraging cns superior supply chain approach to grow faster than the underlying markets continues to bear fruits and jj highlighted a number of opportunities for us on the way forward mike and our operating team are energized and all hands are on deck to balance operational and service excellence our focus remains on delivering value for our customers and ultimately for our shareholdersin spite of a stronger canadian dollar as ghislain confirmed that were also on track to deliver against our yearly outlook both in terms of earnings and reinvesting in our franchiseso on that note were happy to now take your questions and well turn the call back over to you patrickquestions and answersoperator operator instructions the first question is from ravi shanker from morgan stanleyravi shanker morgan stanley research division  executive director a couple of questions if i can squeeze it in one is on pricing clearly theres an industrywide issue but  and you guys saw a sequential price deceleration like everybody else but can you just elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of this and as inflation increase in the second half what could be your sources of price gainsjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident ravi its jj so at  i believe that we are in the range of our industry were also in the range of the first quarter on the grain side we do seasonal pricing so we dont take the grain cap and spread over  months we apply for that price increase when the demand is strongest and take it away when the demand is least but at  i think we are meeting our objective of samestore price above rail inflation rail inflation is below that at this point and i thinkravi shanker morgan stanley research division  executive director and as it increases in  sorry go aheadjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident and i think to work forward thats the range that were in as an industryoperator the next question is from fadi chamoun from bmo capital marketsfadi chamoun bmo capital markets equity research  md and analyst so jj just a question on the crudebyrail which seems like it could be a significant opportunity for you guys going into  and maybe even at the end of this year can you give us your thought on this have you had any discussion with a producer what this opportunity might look like and sort of potential timing of that rampupjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident yes i think fadi i like one of your headline from one of your report where you say crudebyrail opportunity interesting but not yet exciting meaning theres not yet huge capacity shortage of the pipeline capacity so production is ramping up depending on who you talk to it may be later this year or early this year but production exceed pipeline capacity at which time there would be a window for crudebyrail to move product from alberta to wherever the consumer within north america but at this point its not part really of a base case that we expect a lot of crudebyrail pick up in  anyway but if there is we do have the network and the locomotive power to do that so we are in position to be able to do that and if ever the canadian grain crop is a little less than the average that crudebyrail would be a nice way to fill up the second and third quarter of  at this point its a whole car thats  we have to wait for the pipeline industry to be tightoperator the next question is from walter spracklin from rbcwalter noel spracklin rbc capital markets llc research division  analyst so i guess my  i want to focus here on grain and the outlook here i know most of your levers are pretty low on the prairies right now so my question is how do you look at the  your forecast versus a fairly significant comp from last year how should we be modeling an average crop or the risk that it goes below average and do you expect that to be aggravated by any share loss relative to a fairly strong share gain you had last year so could you talk whether you think youre going to lose a little bit of share next year temporarily if anything and what the impact downside could be if we dont get any rain in the prairies here in the neartermjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident so if we take the usual half end of the year its jj in the third quarter what really matter is how early is the crop is it coming  is it harvested in early september so we can move in september or was it coming in quite late where its too late for the third quarter when you get to the fourth quarter every year mikes team railroad very hard because we know the crop is super big well less than average everybody wants to sell grain in the fourth quarter so we run flat out typically the same thing in winter time so the size of the crop is really a second and third quarter  question and thats really i think its too early to tell we will know by the time we have the third quarter result in late  midoctober we will know how big is that crop and then well know the story for  in terms of share i would advise that people not to bet against us were pretty competitive when it comes to the marketplaceghislain houle canadian national railway company  cfo and evp we  lets just say walter that we dont plan on losing share so  and the rest for us is all upside and when were focused on growing the business so well see how things unfoldoperator the next question is from tom wadewitz from ubsthomas richard wadewitz ubs investment bank research division  md and senior analyst just wanted to see if you had  i guess weve heard from csx and theyve talked about some people from another organization that knows about precision railroading that some operational talent has come over to them its not really clear what level or whether thats from  directly from you or former cn people but i just wanted to see if you could comment on whether there are concerns about any kind of operational managers leaving and whether thats something you see at this pointmichael a cory canadian national railway company  coo and executive vicepresident tom its mike here look weve lost a few frontline supervisors so really the effect is small and just so everybodys clear my job my teams job is to continue to teach coach develop people so that we can look down the bench and always have the right amount and the right type of people in line and right now i look down the bench and im extremely comfortable so its a compliment for others to come and emulate our approach and well continue to develop people and go forward but no issue on our partthomas richard wadewitz ubs investment bank research division  md and senior analyst is there a way to kind of frame the magnitude of it like  and it doesnt sound like something youre concerned about but is there a way to say out of how many people out of that level of  is it  out of  people at that level or any way to kind of gauge itmichael a cory canadian national railway company  coo and executive vicepresident i guess id use the word not  the words not significantoperator the next question is from cherilyn radbourne from td securitiescherilyn radbourne td securities equity research  analyst i wanted to give jj a bit of a break by asking mike a question obviously continued strong performance in accommodating the volume growth that youve had and i think most of us in the call would have some familiarity with how mix can impact metrics like revenue per carload or revenue per rtm but i just wondered if you could speak in a bit more detail about how you look at those  key operating metrics and assess them internally in light of volume growth and mix to assess how well youve donemichael a cory canadian national railway company  coo and executive vicepresident okay cherilyn really its been a little bit difficult of a year in terms of trying to compare it to a previous especially  with the volume growth itself the key components here that we  where we look at train speed car velocity locomotive productivity locomotive utilization those things are going to have an impact from that much of a volume growth weve identified clearly areas that weve got to get closer in and diagnose the issue in terms of the train speed weve identified some pinch points but really well do the same thing we always do thats use an integrated team approach use all the resources we have and really look at the existing plan and infrastructure and go from there you can  in terms of just pure productivity our focus is on trainload on how we handle cars and cost to put them through yards whether it be an intermodal yard or whether it be a switching yard those things never change and thats something thats always right front and center of us if that helps answer any questions you haveoperator the next question is from scott group from wolfe researchscott h group wolfe research llc  md  senior transportation analyst so i dont know if this is for luc or ghislain i just want to ask more broadly kind of the way the model is working so its the second quarter in a row where revenue growth outpaced operating income growth and is there in your mind something unusual in the past  quarters just given either something on the cost side or just the magnitude of the revenue growth or is this how you  maybe we should think about the model going forward and maybe more as we kind of look to the back half of the year when revenue and volume growth decelerate into tougher comps should we still think about operating income growth growing slower than revenue growth or do you think we should go back to maybe the normal way of thinking about rails where you see some operating leverage and operating income growth exceeds revenue growth i know a long question but hopefully youluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director scott thanks for the questions its luc listen we dont think that theres any significant change its really a question of mix and how much business is coming onboard in addition to that there are occasionally onetime items that can cloud a little bit the analysis so we still think that the historical model does work from time to time what will happen is youre bringing onboard a significant amount of volume so in that sense your incremental margin is now going to be even and progressive so i think thats a little bit of what weve seen but if you take a step back and look at the first half of the year our incremental margin is probably sitting around  or something like that and when we look at the back half of the year mike is in a good position to continue to improve on the operating metrics and we feel pretty good that we can see potentially a little bit more operational leverage kicking in so  and the nature of  the mix and the nature of what were bringing on a lot of it has been long haul business unit train and in many cases customer cars so that also will tend to create some noise in terms of if youre looking at the revenue yield versus the operating profit yield but we feel comfortable that there is no fundamental change in the model and the way we look at the balance of the year and the way forwardghislain houle canadian national railway company  cfo and evp and scott this is ghislain i would also say that as in my remarks that we had a little bit of a spike up on a yearoveryear basis on incident costs by about  million so again that is reflected in the numbers but to emphasize lucs point i think the model is workingoperator the next question is from turan quettawala from scotiabankghislain houle canadian national railway company  cfo and evp go ahead turanturan quettawala scotiabank global banking and markets research division  director transportation and aerospace equity research sorry i was on mute so i guess my question was on the fuel lag here i was just wondering if you could talk about whether that started to benefit you at all at the end of the quarter and maybe if theres something that could benefit you in q and is it going to be enough potentially at current prices to offset some of the fx impactghislain houle canadian national railway company  cfo and evp turan this is ghislain so as i mentioned in my remarks fuel lag helped us by  million or  in the second quarter and that in the third quarter very very small i would say were looking possibly at a positive lag at this year of about  million so  and there was nothing last year so on a yearoveryear basis you could be talking about  in the third quarteroperator the next question is from ken hoexter from merrill lynchkenneth scott hoexter bofa merrill lynch research division  md and cohead of the industrials can you just maybe jj talk a little bit more about intermodal i think you mentioned a new regina container program for grain are you focusing converting bulk traffic over and away from the highway and maybe talk a little bit about the benefits of the tightening us truck market if youre seeing that on growth opportunity yetjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident okay so the initiative in regina has to do with balancing the extension we have at prince rupert and at deltaport to offer the shipping line a revenue that makes sense for them we need to offer them not only just a good destination but also some revenue on the way back and in southern saskatchewan theres just big growth on the specialty crop most of them are sold overseas a lot of them are sold in containers so  products were going to be offering in order to do that one is this summer raymont logistics will have its transport facility completed by the month of august in rupert they will be able to receive full unit train of specialty crop from anywhere in the prairies of the us to loading container at the port itself and then by the summer of  we will be able also to receive loader container or specialty crop to be loaded in regina which is much closer to where the products are being grown regarding the question on trucking i guess its almost like a capacity and price question were not really seeing yet the tightening of the marketplace within the highway at least on what we do which is mostly repeat contract business not spot business thats actually driving price yet on domestic intermodal so at this point thats i guess its something to come but not there at this point if that helps i cankenneth scott hoexter bofa merrill lynch research division  md and cohead of the industrials yes it doesoperator the next question is from steve hansen from raymond jamessteven p hansen raymond james ltd research division  svp my question is on coal specifically weve seen a pretty significant mix shift of late that i think you described in your remarks im just curious about your outlook here the met side in particular and some of the traffic thats coming out of the northeast part of british columbia and what we should expect into the balance of the year and next yearjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident thank you steve so the canadian coal that we moved to the west coast is mostly met coal some thermal coal but also met coal we also do quite a bit of petroleum coke from northern alberta which is also in our coal result pet coke is mixed in our coal result so those business whether its pet coke from fort mcmurray or canadian coal from canadian coal mine in bc and alberta i would describe them as steady so now were at a cruising phase and the sequential volume will probably stay at this when it comes to us coal its one of our question mark for the fourth quarter so why were not sure yet how much growth we will get in the fourth quarter in total is related to us coal is related to us grain and how that will pan out because the us crop doesnt look fantastic and the crop in south america looks great they have a lot of product and we dont know if we were going to be competing to move corn and soy beans to the gulf by unit train or will a lot of that will end up moving by barges on the mississippi since the mississippi barge rate are quite lowoperator the next question is from brandon oglenski from barclaysbrandon robert oglenski barclays plc research division  vp and senior equity analyst i guess i want to revisit scotts question maybe in a different way when we were at the analyst day last month you guys focused a lot on the intermodal opportunity so i guess just thinking into next year if youre going to see mix more from intermodal outgrowing rest of the business could this be a potential source of margin headwind as we would think about especially with the canadian dollar strengthening and could be  maybe a continuation of the themes weve seen in luc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director thanks for the question brandon its luc listen again we dont really see that as taking shape weve always said that the margin on the intermodal business is on the average for the book of business so in that sense we dont see a significant shift and again weve got the structure to actually take on the volume so we dont foresee a significant changeoperator the next question is from david vernon from bernsteindavid scott vernon sanford c bernstein  co llc research division  senior analyst luc i wanted to kind of hit a little bit on the same topic it does look to me like the incrementals if you strip out the favorable benefit of the pension and even a little bit of the currency youre running closer to  and yet your volume growth is running at the high end that weve seen over the last  years what is it thats taking away the normal volumedriven leverage we would expect to see i mean if youre getting price above inflation this kind of volumedriven leverage i wouldve just sort of expected a better operating income resultluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director yes david let me take a step back and kind of walk you through this a little bit because this is a question thats come up a couple of times and i think we want to make sure people get a clear sense of whats going on a lot of the growth that weve had is actually been very much longhaul business around coal aroundjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident potash frac sandluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director potash and frac sand and so on and so forth so its very good growth but its long haul its also as i mentioned earlier customer equipment so when you look at the revenue what youre going to get is youre going to get a lower revenue yield so thats not a factor of weak pricing that is a factor of the revenue we charge for the book and haul business and a lot of it is unit train as well so that is  we have to disassociate that from the cost structure because the cost structure for moving that business is in fact lower you dont have to pay for the car supply and we do have a very good margin on that business so in effect if you look at whats happening in terms of the operating ratio and leave aside some of the noise which ghislain referred to which may happen from one quarter to the next in some cases youve got fx youve got fuel then youve got some of the casualty costs that can distort a little bit your quarterly numbers but on the whole as i mentioned earlier when you look at the first half of the year and our incremental or is  so we were not seeing a shift away from profitability what happens is the mix and the nature of the business were picking up is leading to very strong gtms and rtms and  but the revenue profile is different so i think that is something that certainly was present in the first half of the year probably were not going to see as much of that in the second half but there will be some so you kind of have to work your way through the nature and the mix of business and you have to look at other metrics not just your revenue yield to assess the quality of what were bringing onboard in terms of growth as well as our efficiency numbers so when mike looked at some of the operational productivity numbers again theyre solid when you compare against similar work levels and volume levels back to  so when you look at all of the other measures you should gain some comfort that there isnt something going on here where were bringing on what i would describe as lowquality growth thats not the case and i mean again the team is very much focused and very  we want to bring in good business onboard but we also  as i said it can be lumpy so in this quarter we picked up a lot of business and so did we in the first quarter and the team  the first mission for the team is bring it on make sure that the levels of service are good and then we kind of look at grinding it out so were constantly looking for opportunities where we can not only lower the cost of servicing the business but as a matter of fact how can we enhance the service levels so you will see that taking place and that is why i think longer term we dont feel that we turn  we have to turn business away we have confidence that we can do it we dont  and jj showed you what the pricing levels are so were very thoughtful in pricing the business and attracting good business and then working it through to maintain the profitability levels that have made us the leading class  in the space so all that to say we feel pretty good about where we are and well continue to crank out these numbers on the way forward and probably youll see a little bit less of this pattern but it will  there will still be some certainly in the second half of the yeardavid scott vernon sanford c bernstein  co llc research division  senior analyst and maybe just as a quick followup to that as you think about grinding up is that a question of rewriting the contracts or is it a question of maybe just getting it more ingrained in the operation and catching up a little bit on the productivity sideluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director yes its not rewriting the contract trust me its the innovation its pushing the envelope i mean this is what mike and his team excel at doing day in and day out so it really is looking at where and how can we improve as i said on the  key dimensions that we always focus on efficiency and service and we  the teams mission and the teams mandate is not to achieve one at the expense of the other so thats what you have to look at and keep your eyes on the team thats what they do bestoperator the next question is from chris wetherbee from citigroupchristian f wetherbee citigroup inc research division  vp i wanted to talk a little bit about the volume cadence in the back half of the year so i think youve had a couple of comments about some of the things that could be variables particularly to the fourth quarter but when you look at the rtm guide and your progress so far i guess im just curious what is the risk to the fourth quarter in terms of actually seeing negative rtms and maybe what are some of those major variables im guessing grain and i think you mentioned us coal could also be part of it but i just wanted to get a sense maybe with some more detail about what some of those moving parts could be in qjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident chris its jj when we get to the fourth quarter one of the thing were unsure of at this point one is us coal us grain the crop but also whether they move on the longhaul railroad or shorthaul railroad sulfur is also a question mark for us either liquid or going to the us or dry going to the coast so its really typically on the bulk side and potash uralkali and canpotex have both settled their contract with the chinese which means now that all contracts will be settled for all other countries but we dont know whether or not we will have the same record potash moved that we did last year in the fourth quarter which was very strong and by the way thats an example of where mike has rewritten how we do business when we move these potash trains from saskatchewan to st john we now move them in  cars nobody moves train of  cars in north america so obviously your cost per unit is down thats how we can compete on a lower cent per rtm and make money despite of that so the fourth quarter question mark is more about the bulk side and whether or not we will have below last year or surprise ourselves and be as good or maybe better than last year we feel more confident about the rest of the economychristian f wetherbee citigroup inc research division  vp but as it stands you got positive rtms into your model for the fourth quarterjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident yes some and then the place in the model where we have negative rtm is bulkrelated and the uncertainty of other commodity which i talked aboutluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director and clearly chris i mean it is tapering down theres no question about that but we dont  as jj pointed out we dont see negative rtm growth but there is a tightening up that will take place in the fourth quarter so far the third quarter is looking goodjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident yes first  weeks is pretty goodluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director so well have to walk it homeoperator the next question is from konark gupta from macquarie capital marketskonark gupta macquarie research  analyst just a question on metals and minerals i guess frac sand iron ore and steel have driven the segment so far this year so where do you see trends in those commodities in the second half in  is there any stickiness basically in the existing frac sand business if growth and drilling activity slows down more materiallyjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident yes its jj so yes there is stickiness in the frac sand business we foresee frac sand sequentially stay at the rate where it is right now theyll eventually relap but we have very strong second quarter in frac sand and if it sequentially maintain that rate its very positive when you look at the cn mm metals and minerals category where you have frac sand into that you have steel you have mineral you also have iron ore but the one that really is driving this category yeartodate is the frac sand and we believe the frac sand will holdoperator the next question is from benoit poirier from desjardins capital marketsbenoit poirier desjardins securities inc research division  vp and industrials transportation aerospace industrial products  special situation analyst jj a lot of color about the currency impact on translation and also on the eps but when you talk to customers i was wondering if you could point out the strength of the canadian dollar whether you see some potential impact on some commodities and whether it makes the canadian ports losing some of their competitive advantage so talking about grain coal forest product whether it could impact some volume in the longer termjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident yes thank you very much so its still early on its what a couple of cents maybe up to  i dont know if the canadian dollar will go up from this point or stay where it is no i dont think  we dont have customers at this point where those   is going to have a material impact on their sales to the united states or sales abroad now frankly at   canadian dollar is quite weak too so one would not think the canadian economy has to rely on such a weak dollar i think at this point i mean this is not a huge change a couple of cents from the point of view of our customers and their production costsoperator the next question is from brian ossenbeck from jpmorganbrian patrick ossenbeck jp morgan chase  co research division  senior equity analyst so ghislain going back to the investor day you said the cost of train control would increase and it wouldnt be a small number so mike mentioned hiring some people for technology and ptc where does the opex and ga stand related to that system right now and where do you expect that to settle out when everythings online call it  first half subdivision is done in  when everything is wrapped upghislain houle canadian national railway company  cfo and evp yes thanks brian when you look at ptc this year i think what were looking at is possibly about  million  of that would be depreciation and in terms of the future years i think were not going to provide guidance for the future years i think were very focused and the team is very focused on delivering and were in the thick of it and were advancing so its good and well see and frankly we need to deliver ptc first before we know once were there how much its going to cost us to support it but we know this year that it will be  million  of it is depreciationoperator the next question is from justin long from stephensjustin trennon long stephens inc research division  md i know it may be a little bit early for this question but i was wondering if you had any thoughts or expectations on this years peak season just given some of your port capacity expansion projects i thought you might have an early read so im curious what youre expecting and whats baked into your guidance for the back half of the yearjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident justin its jj i think for us for this year especially this year the fact that ruperts capacity should be available to all of us by late august in deltaport sometime in the fall might be more relevant than the fall peak itself because now we have the ability to access a lot of capacity and the question will be whether or not cn inaudible and gct collectively would have been able to sell some of that as early as august september october november so we are planning for significant growth in obviously intermodal related to fall peak but more about the capacity available to us now that premarketing that we did about the service that we collectively offer including the service that we have on the south shore of vancouver which already has huge  been a huge help to us in the last  monthsjustin trennon long stephens inc research division  md okay great but maybe to just follow up as you strip out the capacity additions that you have planned does it feel like the underlying demand environment as it relates to peak will improve this year relative to last yearjeanjacques ruest canadian national railway company  cmo and executive vicepresident i wouldnt say so no i dont think the peak this year will be of a different trend or bigger than last year but the canadian economy right now is doing fairly good so i mean the consumption by the canadian consumers and the us midwest and us midamerican consumers seems to be solid and good and obviously weve benefited from that as welloperator the next question is from allison landry from crédit suisseallison m landry crédit suisse ag research division  director thinking about the guidance for the  rtm growth its basically implying a full year number which is i guess slightly above the peak that you saw in  so are you at the point where youre basically really needing to think about ramping up resources and is it fair to say that youre potentially approaching capacity levels mix i know is a factor but any way you can help us think through this would be helpfulghislain houle canadian national railway company  cfo and evp yes allison this is ghislain from a resource standpoint we do and we are hiring i mean if you look at the end of q  versus the end of q  we added about  people and our labor productivity in terms of million gtms per employee was up  when you look at the end of q versus the end of q weve added another  people and again our employee productivity was up  so we are adding people we said we were going to do that and we have to do that a little bit in advance because there is a lead time to train these folks whether its our crews or whether its engineering or mechanical folks so were trying to be ahead of the game but obviously as you can see from these statistics we are not adding one for one so we are absorbing and then ill ask mike to settle in on capacity mike and i and jj are connected very close at the hip were looking at volumes coming were always working together to see potential pinch points where they are and we want to be ahead of the game we want to be investing before it happens but we dont want to do that too early either so we are currently investing to support our intermodal business we are investing to support our growth in frac sand from a capacity standpoint we will continue to look at this and do that next year so i think that its a lot of volume coming at us so were pleased about the work that weve done were pleased about the fact that weve been able to absorb and well continue to absorb some of that volume and were pleased about the fact that were trying to stay ahead of the game in terms of our investmentmichael a cory canadian national railway company  coo and executive vicepresident i cant add a whole lot since ghislain said most but ill refer to what luc was talking about allison we really  we clearly diagnose whatever the issue may be thats creating what we might see to be a pinch point and before we spend we look internally whether its infrastructure we already have whether its some innovative way to approach it but thats been our template for a long time and that will continue but to ghislains point we know the areas that weve seen extreme growth we know the areas that weve seen train speed drop to a degree we definitely come together as a group and weve identified a lot of things were going to do and well see where that takes us and well do what we have to do in order to service the customer the way they expect and need and the way we need to keep the cost downluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director and allison just to put icing on the cake here youre getting all  for  i would say  its luc i would say that what we constantly do is we triage and we prioritize where we see the most leverage and the most opportunities for deploying capital so that is always what weve talked about is within the scope of our capital envelope and what we do is we prioritize depending on where and how we see the opportunities so you shouldnt expect a significant shift in the profile of our capex over time it should be in line with what weve described at the investor dayoperator the next question is from david tyerman from cormark securitiesdavid bruce tyerman cormark securities inc research division  analyst of institutional equity research yes so just following up on the comments on hiring so should we expect hiring to continue at  to  people additional or does it slow down quite a bit as the volume growth slows downluc jobin canadian national railway company  ceo president and director listen i think im not going to give you david a specific number of what were going to do is continue to  we will hire were looking at whats ahead of us but well not hire one for one so thats the key and were going to continue to absorb some of that volume with the service and the operations that we have soall right well thank you for the questions obviously were very pleased and were very proud of our second quarter results i think they continue to support what we have been doing for several years in terms of advancing our strategy and gaining traction in the marketplace and we continue to see future growth ahead of what the base markets can bring to us weve got a lot of good initiatives going on our offering in the marketplace is resonating with customers so we feel good about our ability to attract retain and work through  efficiently work through the business that were bringing onboard so a good quarter a very good quarter actually when you look at these numbers and i think the year is shaping very well and again were restating our guidance and were staying in spite of some of the changes in currencies and other little headwinds were staying the course so were looking forward to bringing you up to date when we have our third quarter call and in the meantime thank you for joining in and well see you
