personal privacy platform where you are always in control even after you hit send or submit mobile messaging email and file storage are the first personal cybersecurity sectors that datchat is addressing with its unique proprietary technology the datchats technology allows you to change the rights to your messages and personal information any time after you hit send or submit starting with messaging datchat is the first privacy platform to always allow the option to erase or change how long your messages stay on another person’s device you are always in full control of your personal privacy with datchat when sending someone a message you can wipe it from your phone and theirs at any time unique to datchat are features such as screenshot protection nuke which allows the complete eradication of a conversation on everyone’s device multilayered encryption and the datchat messaging rights control platform the opportunity of privacy the cybersecurity industry is growing exponentially and it is expected to reach  billion in just a few years while most of the focus seems to be on protecting our information where it is stored datchat is focused on protecting our privacy after we have already shared our personal and financial information one of the biggest threats to our privacy comes from what happens after we have hit send submit or even delete datchat’s unique technology is focused on always providing privacy control and security when you really need it the most the company that puts us back in control of our personal privacy can truly change the face of communications and financial security this protects all of us and creates a tremendous investing opportunity our patent pending technology allows us to stay in control of our information even after we hit send or submit disruption while you are probably familiar with many of the messaging and email platforms did you know that they all share the same major privacy flaw that creates substantial risk to our personal privacy and security they do not allow us to control our messages or information after we hit send datchat is ready right now to totally disrupt the entire cybersecurity and messaging industry by allowing full control of our personal and financial information both before and especially after we hit send or submit over  hours of development we have spent over two years developing privacy technology that is there for you when you need it the most…after you hit send first we are rolling out the platform for iphone and imessage this is happening now our goal is to work as a stand alone platform and integrate into existing messaging platforms including email become a datchat ambassador investor as a special limited time offer for our early investors you will get twice the amount of shares when you invest you will automatically be enrolled in the datchat ambassador program which entitles you to receive an equal number of stock option shares unique opportunity for the last  years private companies could only raise capital from accredited investors the wealthiest  of americans recently the jobs act was signed title iv regulation a of the jobs act went into effect allowing private earlystage companies to raise money from everyone the reg a offering is often referred to as a miniipo we are conducting a reg a tier  offering that allows us to raise up to  million dollars under title iv of the jobs act the company has had to submit form a registration statement to the sec for qualification and is subject to ongoing reporting requirements like an ipo reg a allows companies to offer shares to the general public and not just accredited investors the shares you purchase are immediately freely tradable new communication platform until now no messaging platform allowed you to change the rights to your messages after you hit send messaging rights management platform patent pending technology allows a sender to set a message to last forever or automatically selfdestruct after a certain number of views at any time a sender can wipe texts off a recipient’s phone or give them more time to view the message nuke a conversation users can even opt to nuke messages which erases both sides of the conversation on both the sender and recipient’s devices encryption all datchat messages are encrypted with aes for the message and rsa for the key to ensure your messages are only seen by you and your intended recipients each message is individually encrypted for the recipient and cannot be forwarded or saved additionally all messages are sent and received via a ssl connection and can never be viewed by datchat under any circumstance screenshot protection datchat’s patent pending protection mode makes it nearly impossible to screenshot a secret picture or message also the sender receives notifications when someone attempts to screenshot protected or regular self destructing messages nuke  self destructing messages the sender decides how many times pictures or messages can be viewed before they selfdestruct also the sender can dictate how many views are left or erase the content at any time users can even opt to nuke messages which erase both sides of the conversation on both the sender and recipient’s devices hide in plain sight senders can hide pictures and information on the camera roll hidden and encrypted behind other pictures only the cover photo can be seen in plain sight screenshot protection datchat features a protection mode which makes it nearly impossible to screenshot a secret message also the sender receives notifications when someone attempts to screenshot protected or regular selfdestructing messages without a trace messages vanish without a trace when they reach a view limit or are manually destructed and are deleted forever datchat inc employees can never access messages powerful privacy every message sent is double encrypted and can only be viewed by the sender and the intended recipient fast safe  easy it is easy to send and control messages camraflage is datchat’s patentpending technology that hides a message behind a decoy cover photo camraflage messages can be sent via encrypted messages using the direct messaging built into datchat imessage or email patent pending only messenger that allows you to change how many views or time remains after sending erasing both sides of a conversation on your recipients phone screenshots can be prevented with our antiscreenshot technology encrypted text and pictures can be added to videos that can only be viewed and decrypted by the intended recipients video scrambling technology that renders our selfdestructing videos useless why reg a is perfect for datchat don’t you think it is better to have thousands of investors that will use and help spread the word and protect their privacy at the same time experienced management team team story each person on the datchat team understands two things first nothing is more important than protecting our personal privacy second the technology to protect our privacy has to be easy to use and always guarding us we have assembled a team of developers marketers and advisors to help ensure our technology and solutions put us back in control of our privacy the inspiration for datchat came when darin and pete were asked by a friend to recover deleted messages their phone they were
