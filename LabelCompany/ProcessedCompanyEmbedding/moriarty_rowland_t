experienced buyer tended to have a larger evoked set have a larger number of vendors in the final consideration set possess a larger number of selection criteria and better discriminate among potential suppliers introduction the role of prior experience eg product knowledge product familiarity in information processing has become a major topic of investigation in the cognitive sciences chi glaser and rees  larkin et al  and in recent years has received increased attention from consumer researchers prior experience or more generally some type of feedback mechanism from purchase experiences has been included in traditional models of consumer behavior cf bettman  hansen  howard  howard and sheth  more recently several experimental studies have examined the relationship between prior experience and consumer choice processes eg sudan  beattie  johnson and russo   in these studies differences in experts and novices information processing strategies have been observed interestingly however the research on prior experience has not been as pervasive in the area of organizational buying even though effects of experience if observed in this context could be extremely important to organizational sellers organizational researchers have distinguished among the different types of buying decisions such as new task modified rebuy and straight rebuy robinson faris and wind  lehmann and oshaughnessy  relating the newness of the problem to the organization with information requirements and to the consideration of alternative sources of supply however these researchers have not examined differences in information processing strategies based upon the individuals experience in purchasing the product regardless of the particular type purchase for the organization the research reported here seeks to contribute to our knowledge of organizational buying processes by examining the relationship between the prior purchase experience of organizational buyers and several information processing variables typically measured by organizational buying behavior researchers cf moriarty and galper  moriarty and spekman  in addition it also contributes to the general literature on the effects of prior experience it may be easier to study and detect differences due to prior knowledge or experience in organizational purchasing decisions because they often involve more complex products that require more information processing in general and because they often take place over a longer period of time than consumer decisions cf ames and hlavacek  cyert simon and trow  experience here may be more of an advantage than in consumer settings role of prior experience in information processing two views of how prior knowledge affects information processing have been put forward in the consumer behavior literature in the first it is hypothesized that consumers highly familiar with a product will engage in less search for information than consumers unfamiliar with the product highly familiar consumers are more likely to know specific facts about existing alternatives and therefore would not need to gather additional information paradoxically according to this invertedu hypothesis consumers very unfamiliar with the product would also engage in little search for them however more than a little search is too difficult and cognitively taxing consumers who know a moderate amount about the product would engage in the most search because they have the ability to handle the incoming information and have a motivation to acquire more bettman and park  for example used the invertedu  hypothesis to interpret findings regarding the effects of  experience on the types of information processed eg prior information and attribute evaluations and the processing heuristics used eg processing by attribute or by brand comparisons to standards in this research the moderate experience group did more processing of currently available information and relied less on prior knowledge than did the high and low experience groups similarly johnson and russo   found that moderately experienced subjects asked to make a product choice recalled more statements about the product than  subjects with either high or low experience perhaps indicating greater attention to or use of information according to a second hypothesis however knowledge about a particular product facilitates learning new information highly familiar consumers should be able to encode information about additional alternatives more efficiently and thus may tend to gather more information than consumers not familiar with the product support for this enrichment hypothesis that existing knowledge facilitates learning new information has also been found in a complex usage situation brucks  found that knowledge increased search efficiency by allowing faster recognition of poor or inappropriate alternatives and facilitated the asking of questions about attributes of the alternatives and johnson and russo  report a linear effect in the levels of recall as a function of prior experience when subjects were asked to form a judgment about each product despite the as yet unresolved differences between these two views the research into the impact of prior experience on decisionmaking behavior has helped produce a better understanding of the nature of consumer buying behavior in organizational buying behavior contexts however little attention has been paid to variables affecting the processing of information by members of the buying center with the exception of studies on the sources of information used moriarty and spekman  sheth  kelly and hensel  ozanne and churchill  and information as a means of risk reduction webster and wind  thus the current study borrows heavily from the research on consumers in order to investigate the effects of prior purchasing experience on informationprocessing strategies employed by organizational buyers an implicit assumption then is that organizational buyers will be subject to the same cognitive limitations and strategies as end use consumers hypotheses hypotheses regarding the effects of experience on industrialorganizational buyers were derived from the theory and research on this topic in consumer behavior specifically the invertedu and the enrichment hypotheses formed the basis for predictions regarding four dependent variables  more experienced buyers will include more alternate vendors in their evoked set ie the set that first came to mind when they were initially faced with the decision than less experienced buyers  more experienced buyers will include a smaller number of vendors in their final consideration set than less experienced buyers  more experienced buyers will consider a larger number of attributes when waking a purchase decision than will less experienced buyers  more experienced buyers will perceive greater differences between alternatives than less experienced buyers as in previous consumer studies prior experience in making these kinds of purchase decisions should result in a greater awareness of and knowledge about alternatives this greater knowledge base will be reflected in the number of alternatives that initially come to mind when facing a purchase decision in the number of attributes perceived to be important and the distinctions made between alternatives on those attributes on the other hand greater knowledge or experience should make it easier to recognize and disregard inappropriate alternatives thus more experienced buyers may ultimately consider only a few alternative vendors less experienced buyers final consideration sets may be larger because they are less able to evaluate and disregard inappropriate alternatives they become aware of in their decision process method data was collected from decisionmaking units dmus in approximately  organizations that had made major procurements of nonintelligent data terminals within the previous  months these organizations represented a stratified random sample of dun  bradstreet companies including five industry sectors manufacturing business services transportation finance and wholesalingretailing and three size classifications  to  employees  to  employees and more than  employees for purposes of the larger study of which this was a part a telephone snowballing technique was used to identify all participants in the decision to buy the terminals questionnaires were sent to all decision participants who agreed to cooperate with the study analysis for the current study is based on the responses of  individuals involved in the buying process for  organizations to be included a respondent must have reported that heshe played at least a somewhat important role in the search process the vendor and product evaluation process and the vendor selection process for example an individual who was very involved in the initial vendor search process but not involved in the final selection of vendors w not included thus our sample consists of individuals who were involved in the entire process and not just a part of it other analyses were conducted with more stringent definitions of both experience and role to test the sensitivity of the results to sample definition changes while the statistical results varied slightly due to different inclusion rules the direction of the mean responses were consistent throughout independent variable the independent variable in this study was the amount of prior experience the individual had in making major data terminal procurement decisions past experience with the product per se was not of interest but rather the cognitive structures that were presumably caused by having been previously involved in purchasing data terminals defined the productrelated experience of concern were the number of major data terminal system procurement decisions the individual had participated in during hisher career not just in the current firm as such years of employment years of experience in the company length of time in a position or position title were not reliable measures of prior experience in addition since participation in such a major purchase as data terminals is generally not considered to be an everyday occurrence it was felt that the individual respondents would be able to accurately recall prior participation three experience groups were created the low prior experience group individuals reported participation in one or no previous decisions moderate prior experience subjects had participated in two or three previous decisions high prior experience group members had participated in four or more decisions three groups are the minimum needed to detect any curvilinear relationship between experience and the dependent variables and the maximum allowed by the variability in the experience measure in this sample finally an analysis was conducted to determine whether experience as measured in this study was related to or confounded with the position of the respondent in hisher company a oneway analysis of variance showed no significant differences in experience as a function of position in the company dependent measures four dependent measures were examined separately the number of vendors respondents reported to be in their initial evoked sets the number of vendors heshe reported as being in the final consideration set the importance ratings for  product and vendor attributes and ratings of the degree of difference between vendors on the same attributes for the first of these respondents merely were asked how many possible suppliers came to mind when they first became aware of the companys needs for the second measure respondents were asked how many vendors there were during the final stages of selection ratings on point likert scales for  attributes formed the last two measures for each attribute the respondent rated its importance and the degree of difference among suppliers in the industry on that attribute results and discussion separate analyses of variance were used to test each hypothesis the independent variable in each instance was the respondents experience low moderate high when significant overall differences were found spjotvollstoline tests kirk  for paired comparisons were conducted to determine the location of the difference number in the evoked set the first hypothesis proposed that the more experienced industrial buyer would include a greater number of alternative vendors in hsher evoked set when faced with a purchasing decision the analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of expertise f   p   as shown in table  the more inexperienced the purchaser the smaller the size of the evoked set pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between the low and high groups and between the moderate and high groups  z   the difference between the low and moderate groups was not significant however the absolute value of the difference between these means was  while the critical difference that the pairwise comparison had to exceed to be declared significant was  the results of this analysis demonstrate the potential influence that prior knowledge exerts on organizational buying behavior it is not surprising that the more experienced buyer could call to mind more potential vendors when heshe first becomes aware of the companys needs the person who has had more experience with vendors and has gone through the search process a few times is probably more aware of the vendors who offer the needed equipment table  information variables by the amount of experience the buyer possesses size of the final consideration set as suggested by the second hypothesis it seems likely that the more experienced purchaser would be able to quickly eliminate inappropriate vendors and would consider seriously only a small number of vendors when making the final decision the inexperienced purchaser may have a difficult time eliminating vendors due to a lack of prior knowledge pertaining to equipment or services offered and would tend to obtain the needed information from several vendors contrary to our expectations the more experienced purchaser had a much larger number of potential vendors in the final consideration set while the overall hypothesis of equity of means could not be rejected f   the average size of the final consideration set became larger with increased experience see table  in fact the experienced buyers included a larger number of alternatives in their final consideration set than in their initial evoked set while the opposite was true for the inexperienced buyers these results are consistent with the enrichment hypothesisgreater prior knowledge facilitated the collection of more knowledge the purchase of nonintelligent data terminals might be considered a complex usage situation and these results would lend support to findings that knowledge increased search efficiency brucks  the more inexperienced buyers may know so little about product attributes and about different companies that they have difficulty evaluating alternative suppliers our results in this particular context also suggest that risk may be an important element in the buyers task environment an inexperienced buyer may perceive the purchase decision as riskier than an experienced buyer and thus may narrow hisher search to only a few wellknown suppliers in the context stud ed here inexperienced buyers may have relied more on ibm and felt less able to evaluate other perhaps riskier choices thus future research will be needed to determine if these differences between experienced and inexperienced buyers persist when there is less risk or when there is not a dominant supplier number of important attributes buyers familiar with the particular product class were expected to use more evaluative criteria in making a product choice beattie  scrull  while the more experienced buyers in the current study considered a greater number of attributes to be important than did the other groups table  the overall analysis of variance was not significant f   the list of product attributes was based on initial research on the data terminal industry and on a review of several private studies conducted within the data terminal industry for all but five attributes over  percent of the respondents rated the attributes  or  on the importance scale of  unimportant to  very important for example  percent of the respondents replied that the reliability of the product was important ie a   or  on the measurement scale unfortunately the list of attributes may have been skewed too much towards obviously important things and respondents were not forced to prioritize them or make any kind of tradeoffs among them thus the lack of significant effects on attribute importance may be due to too little variability in the dependent measure or to the fact that many attributes are important in organizational buying situations but few are deterministic one review of organizational buying behavior has suggested that experienced purchasers emphasize price more than inexperienced purchasers debruicker and summe  in the current study the five attributes receiving the lowest importance ratings were lowest price vendors willingness to negotiate price vendor offers large volume discounts vendor visibility among top management people and the aesthetics of the product style design color size since three of the five attributes receiving low importance ratings dealt in some way with price future analysis should seek to determine whether there is a difference among buyers with respect to the level of experience and a reduced set of macroattributes vendor differences consumer research has suggested that inexperienced buyers tend to perceive fewer distinctions among suppliers on product attributes than do the more experienced buyers cf beattie  the fourth hypothesis proposed just such a finding in the industrial arena respondents were asked to indicate their opinion of the degree of difference among suppliers on each of the  selection criteria for which they had given importance ratings the likert scale ranged from l to  with  indicating that the suppliers were all about the same and  signifying a big difference among suppliers oneway analysis of variance found a marginally significant overall difference between level of experience and differences among suppliers f   p   the average difference for the low experience group was  with the average difference for the moderate and high experience groups being  and  respectively analysis of the pairwise comparisons revealed that there was a marginally significant difference between the low and high experience groups    the other pairwise comparisons were not significant possible explanations for this could be that it takes quite a few purchase situations for the effect of experience to impact the discriminatory processes of the buyer or that not much is gained by having additional experience summary this research was motivated by the work being conducted in consumer behavior which examines the relationship between prior experience and consumer decision making it was an initial attempt to empirically test consumer behavior theory in an industrial marketing context some results supported previous consumer behavior findings while others did not however this is not unusual given the mixed results also reported in the consumer behavior literature specifically the current research tends to support the enrichment hypothesis frequently examined by consumer behavior researchers while statistical significance was not always found the more experienced buyer tended to  have a larger evoked set  have  larger number of vendors in the final consideration set  possess a larger number of selection criteria and  better discriminate among potential suppliers previous organizational buyer behavior research has generally focused upon the information requirements surrounding the type of buying situation for example a straight rebuy situation would suggest that only a minimal amount of information was required based upon the current research it now becomes questionable whether a minimal amount of information is required or if the buyer has just become more efficient in the information search process on the other hand a new task buying situation based upon previous organizational behavior literature would have had a greater information requirement however it is suggested here that the new task buyer would not have utilized a greater amount of information research concerning the presence or absence of prior experience with a product class has significant implications for the industrial marketer specifically such information is paramount for communications strategy development insight into how experience affects the choice process can help in determining the type of information most effective for buyers with differing levels of experience sales presentations could easily be geared for the different levels of experience while fairly common in industrial marketing the method of data collection in the current study is extremely different from the laboratory experiments typically conducted in consumer behavior research and there may be some difficulty in studying information processing with an uncontrolled field study rather than in a controlled experimental context studying information processes by way of mailed questionnaires does not allow the experimenter to manipulate variables eg experience or to monitor the process eg time that the respondent uses in making decisions additionally presenting the respondents with a list of relevant attributes and asking them to rate the degree of importance of each may tend to bias the responses in that the respondent way not have thought of a particular characteristic but sees it as important now that heshe knows about it finally retrospective reports may not be as accurate for the early as the latter stages of the decision however field research has the advantage of tapping actual organizational buyers regarding actual buying decisions the current research of course leaves many questions regarding the information processing strategies of organizational buyers unanswered further studies must replicate and extend this study by including measures of many more processing variables with a more controlled method perhaps we might be able to track information search and use more precisely beyond this the general area of prior knowledge or experience seems to be important for understanding organizational buying behavior further research for example could examine differences between levels of experience and the macroattributes eg price that the buyer uses having an idea as to whether the buyer will focus hisher final decision on price sales competence service etc would assist the industrial marketer in determining which criteria to emphasize in the sales presentation finally this study examined organizational buyers purchasing nonintelligent data terminals future studies could examine organizational buyers at opposite ends of the risk or complexity spectrum such as office supplies mainframe computers to determine whether the level of experience has different effects with different types of products references ames bc and jd hlavacek  managerial marketing for industrial

automate the marketing and sales function is the next frontier as everybody knows over the past decade information systems have been making great inroads in engineering and manufacturing automation has cut direct labor to a small fraction of production costs—an average of  to  in manufacturing companies therefore wringing yet more cost reductions from production labor is increasingly difficult in such technically advanced industries as computers semiconductors airframes metalworking and autos incremental investments are now garnering diminishing returns on the other hand investments in marketing and sales automation systems hold tremendous potential for productivity improvements marketing and sales costs average  to  of total corporate costs not just production costs so a focus on marketing and sales provides a welcome lever for boosting productivity moreover the importance of marketing and sales services is growing according to the us trade representative and the national association of accountants manufacturers’ service activities account for  to  of all value added this means that the price a product can command is less a reflection of raw materials and labor than of marketingrelated services like selecting appropriate product features determining the product mix and ensuring product availability and delivery in cases we have reviewed sales increases arising from advanced marketing and sales information technology have ranged from  to more than  and investment returns have often exceeded  these returns may sound like the proverbial free lunch but they are real because of the complexity of their marketing organizations large companies are good prospects for what we call marketing and sales productivity msp systems tangles of national account management direct sales telemarketing direct mail literature fulfillment advertising customer service dealers and distributors all offer opportunities for efficiency improvements but even small companies that adopt msp systems can expect impressive results marketing automation investments by a  billion electronics manufacturer and an  million custom printing company each produced a firstyear return of more than  the electronics concern installed a sales support system for more than  salespeople sales rose  sales force productivity rose  and sales force attrition dropped  the reduced attrition alone produced savings in recruiting and training costs that paid for the company’s  million investment in less than  months at the custom printer an  investment in a minicomputer and telemarketing software returned a  increase in sales and attained payback in less than  months increasing marketing productivity even a small amount can have a great impact on the bottom line msp systems have a double punch because they can reduce fixed costs and variable costs lower fixed costs mean lower breakeven points so a given percentage increase in sales produces a correspondingly larger increase in operating profits as the chart on the next page shows meanwhile lower variable costs mean that every sale contributes more to the bottom line indeed because lower variable costs make the slope of the new contribution curve steeper the absolute size of the financial advantage continues to grow as sales rise an msp system creates a financial advantage despite the proven worth of this technology few companies have automated any part of their marketing and sales functions even fewer appear to understand the significant strategic benefits that can accrue from marketing and sales automation most early adopters have automated as a matter of faith rather than as part of a strategy for gaining competitive advantage a better approach begins with an understanding of what marketing and sales automation can do how it works and how it can be implemented what the systems do distinct from general office automation systems msp networks are of course specific to marketing and sales they support more intense product or service differentiation improved customer service reduced operating costs and more streamlined operations here are some msp systems and the tasks for which they are customarily used salesperson productivity tools—planning and reporting of sales calls reporting of expenses entering orders checking inventory and order status managing distributors tracking leads and managing accounts direct mail and fulfillment—merging cleaning and maintaining mailing lists subsetting lists or markets tracking and forwarding leads customizing letters envelopes and labels generating “picking lists” for literature packages and managing literature inventory telemarketing—merging cleaning and maintaining calling lists subsetting lists or markets tracking and forwarding leads ranking prospects and prompting scripts sales customer service and support sales and marketing management—providing automated sales management reports sales forecasts sales activity forecasts versus actuals and so on designing and managing sales territories and analyzing marketing and sales programs by such criteria as market territory product customer type price and channel msp systems can automate the work of a single salesperson a single marketing activity like direct mail or a company’s entire marketing and sales operation msp systems also cut across every type of information technology from singleuser pcs to networks of pcs minicomputers and mainframes serving thousands of users a simple system meets the needs of one fastgrowing  million producer of data communications equipment that sells its products through  distributors to cut down on paperwork in handling sales leads the company adopted a pcbased msp system see the flow chart showing its operation compare this with the networks supporting the more than  direct salespeople of a major office automation vendor see the “map” showing its operation this vendor’s system combines direct selling distributor relationships telemarketing and direct mail to generate qualify rankorder distribute and track sales leads fill prospects’ requests for product and price information update customer and prospect files provide sales and technical product support by telephone and automate order entry and sales reporting a simple msp flow chart for handling leads map of an integrated msp system for a major office automation company while the scales of these two networks are obviously vastly different both of them collect organize and update information about every lead generated every sales task performed and every customer or prospect closed or terminated what is less obvious but no less important is the basis both systems provide for improving marketing and sales executives’ decision making most msp data bases contain essential information on customers prospects products marketing programs and marketing channels some systems supplement the essentials with industry data growth rates entries exits and regulatory trends and data on competitors products pricing sales trends and market shares for most businesses the information incorporates a subtle but important shift from other data bases rather than focusing on products what was the cost to produce each unit how many units were made sold and shipped the msp data base is customer driven whenever marketing or sales activities are performed the data base captures information that answers questions about customers and their needs who were the prospects what were their interests how were these interests generated which sales or marketing personnel performed which tasks when were the tasks performed which followup tasks are required and when did any sales result gradually the data base becomes a rich source of marketing and sales information enabling management to track marketing activities and measure the results of marketing programs how they aid productivity msp systems improve productivity in two ways first automation of selling and direct marketing support tasks boosts the efficiency of the sales and marketing staff second automating the collection and analysis of marketing information improves the timeliness and quality of marketing and sales executives’ decision making these networks make direct sales and direct marketing more efficient by automating highly repetitive support tasks like answering requests for product literature and writing letters and by reducing the time salespeople spend on nonselling tasks like scheduling sales calls compiling sales reports generating proposals and bids and entering orders in  xerox installed an internally developed msp system in its southern region xerox credits the system with a  to  gain in sales force productivity and with trimming  million off the company’s  marketing support and overhead budget by automating sales administration and support tasks xerox has given its salespeople more time to sell msp systems for direct marketing also hone the efficiency of customer contacts for example a system for the telemarketing function can schedule and dial calls based on the prospect’s priority prompt the telemarketer with a sales script and automatically update customer files at aratex services a  million uniform supply company based in encino california telemarketers using the company’s old manual system each made  to  calls per day and about one sale per month working with an automated system each telemarketer now makes  or  calls daily and lands three or four sales per month automated networks also elevate the impact of each sales communication access to the central data base gives salespeople and direct marketers information to improve the quality of the contact whether it is by mail by telephone or in person a large financial services concern uses a telemarketing system to handle account inquiries while responding to a customer’s request or query the telemarketer is prompted by the system to update the customer’s profile information and to crosssell other financial products at a division of vanity fair that makes women’s and children’s apparel salespeople use laptop pcs to access the corporate data base for uptodate inventory and order status information on  stockkeeping units this step has trimmed the company’s order cycle from more than two weeks to just three days it also has made ordering more accurate resulting in greater customer satisfaction reduced order cancellations and a  increase in sales in companies with many channels msp systems upgrade efficiency by using the central data base to track and coordinate all marketing activity without this coordination independent marketing groups often unwittingly pursue conflicting goals at one multibilliondollar office automation company a direct salesperson had just nailed down a big order by giving a key account the “maximum” price discount before the deal was signed however the telemarketing group reached this customer and undercut the salesperson’s price by  aside from the damage to its reputation this vendor lost much of its expected margin on the sale this company is now installing an msp system that will collect and organize information on all marketing programs and activities including  all customer contacts whether by mail phone direct salesperson or national account manager  the status of all sales efforts  the origins of all leads  all leads that are being qualified internally and by whom and all leads that have been forwarded to distributors  all customers who decided to buy  what and when they purchased and  any incentives or promotions that helped close the deal coordination of information through this system is expected to prevent further embarrassments a management tool creation of an msp data base is an investment in astute management the data base chronicles every one of a company’s marketing and sales activities from advertising that generates leads to direct mail and telephone qualification of the leads to closing the first sale—all the way through the life of each account it enables marketing and sales management to relate marketing actions with marketplace results at the  million data communications company whose leadhandling system we diagrammed marketing managers use this system to evaluate media placements on the basis of sales closed before this procedure was in place the company had no way to link information on leads to sales and evaluated media placements solely on the number of leads generated not closed msp systems also reduce marketing inertia because they streamline the implementation of marketing programs for example after designing an inhouse system to organize and manage its customerprospect files one  million industrial manufacturer let  manufacturer’s agents go and replaced them with inhouse direct mail and telemarketing functions the results the company raised its accounts by  and cut marketing costs from  of sales to  systems for sales force automation also drive the rapid implementation of less drastic changes in marketing programs by using telecommunications software and laptop pcs du pont’s remington arms division has trimmed the time requirement for a national rollout of pricing and promotional programs from two weeks to less than two days as marketing managers become accustomed to these systems they find new uses for them like analyzing and modeling the buying behavior of prospects and customers the data base at excelan a  million marketer of circuit boards and software in san jose california was essential in identifying a shift in customers’ buying behavior from a very technical product focus to an office automation orientation this discovery has influenced the marketing and sales managers’ decisions about hiring and training employees as well as about selecting and developing new target markets account histories also improve management’s ability to devise and implement account management policies based on profits by linking orders services delivered and prices paid with the actual costs of lead generation preselling closing distribution and postsale support msp systems furnish the tools for analyzing and adjusting the marketing mix grede foundries a milwaukee producer of castings for original equipment manufacturers has used the msp system to develop a “perceived quality index” that yields a more complete and more accurate measure of customers’ reactions than simply tracking returned goods the system also provides pricing support by tracking quoted prices and final selling prices the system gives management a better idea of the price that will win a particular job moreover automated networks coordinate and direct sales resources—including salespeople distributors and agents direct mailers telemarketers and manufacturers’ representatives—toward the highest priority prospects and customers hewlettpackard’s qualified lead tracking system quilts electronically transmits inquiries to a telemarketing center which qualifies and ranks them and electronically returns them to hp headquarters the company has trimmed the turnaround time for leads from as much as  weeks to as little as  hours “hot” leads are handled even faster they are telephoned to the field sales force from the telemarketing center similarly field salespeople in chevron chemical’s fertilizer division in san francisco use laptop pcs to access rankordered prospect lists in the company’s mainframe at any time the salespeople have access to leads that are only  hours old before automation new prospect lists were printed at headquarters and mailed to the field reps which took one to two weeks finally the msp data base is a management tool for making better use of marketing resources—that is ensuring that they are employed to further corporate goals rather than the goals of individual marketing or sales groups while this may sound like something management does without effort our research shows that optimizing marketing resources is much more easily said than done in several companies we’ve looked at salespeople routinely discard hundreds or even thousands of sales leads making little or no effort to evaluate or review them in essence they are dissipating the resources that generated these leads—budgets for advertising trade shows public relations and other communications media in their defense the salespeople complain that pursuing raw leads is a waste of time and they are generally right in one of these companies salespeople who followed up the raw leads averaged only one or two sales per month while those who followed their “instincts” averaged more than three the cost of pursuing the raw leads was at least one lost sale per salesperson per month to the salespeople ignoring the leads was common sense on the other hand the advertising group which was evaluated on the number of leads generated was increasing its budgets to generate more and more leads one company has solved this problem by implementing an msp system that will use telemarketing to qualify leads before sending them to the salespeople the system will also close the loop allowing management to evaluate both the company’s advertising placements and its sales efforts on the basis of their contributions to revenues and earnings economies of scale small businesses may gain an initial competitive edge from msp systems because they often can adopt these systems much faster than their big counterparts with fewer levels of management small companies are faster on their feet in making decisions they also tend to have simpler marketing organizations usually relying on a singlemethod singlechannel selling system like a small direct sales force large companies face two imposing barriers first they generally have both multiple layers of administration and crossfunctional decisionmaking groups when analyzing evaluating and adopting msp systems large companies draw in not only marketing and sales but also the accounting finance and mis functions second—as a glance at the flow chart and map shows—their marketing organizations customarily rely on complex arrangements of communications methods and selling channels accordingly their msp systems require great sophistication and customization in large companies marketing and sales automation is a highstakes decision needing the support of many parties in a major telecommunications company the evaluation and selection of an msp system called for  initial screening presentations by three software vendors  detailed presentations to  senior executives  a visit by eight managers to a company with an operating msp system and  at least nine internal followup meetings including presentations to the vice president of marketing and sales the general managers of the ten operating companies the directors of the mis and misprocurement groups several financial analysts and several senior salespeople more than  people had a hand in the decision all this work occurred in a period of more than nine months after the corporate decision to automate marketing and sales but the story doesn’t end there once the company had selected a  offtheshelf system it spent  months and  more installing and customizing the software during the next two years functional additions to the system and training of the end users added more than  million to the cost efficiencies gained through task automation and improved marketing management are interdependent and reinforcing task automation drives the collection of more complete customer and marketplace information and more informed decision making targets marketing and sales activities where they are most effective in this way marketers get a bigger payoff from lowcost lowimpact selling methods like direct mail and catalogs as data bases customize the timing and content of massmarketing campaigns at the same time highcost highimpact selling methods like personal selling and national account management become more efficient as msp systems perform routine sales support tasks reduce nonselling time and synchronize the use of these resources when you combine lowcost lowimpact methods with highcost highimpact approaches to gain just the right amount of stimulus at just the right time you can obtain hefty impact at minimum cost hewlettpackard for one has taken advantage of this synergy and has discovered the savings made possible by orchestrating direct mail telemarketing and personal selling how to get from here to there the cases we have reviewed show that companies implementing msp systems encounter many of the same barriers they would confront adopting any new technology from our observation the process can be streamlined by following six guiding principles  clarify the scale of the project as well as potential additions an audit of the marketing and sales tasks will yield these categories those that must be automated now those that will or may be automated later and those that will not be automated this simple exercise will identify marketing and sales activities that must be coordinated and focus the automation effort on getting measurable results without sacrificing flexibility it is important to view the project not from the perspective of the marketing groups but from a corporate perspective with a corporate view the company can build a “battleship”—a system that takes advantage of informationsharing and taskcoordination synergies without this strategic perspective independent marketing groups are more likely to invest in a number of incompatible and wasteful “rowboats” and even a rowboat can cause problems at a big hightech manufacturer eight salespeople had their own pcbased sales force automation system installed by raising issues of compatibility data entry and “file structure definitions” they delayed the startup of a company wide salesperson msp system for more than a year  concentrate on tasks that can add value for the customer as in other corporate activities marketers can get competitive advantage in two ways by lowering costs and by enhancing the differentiation of the product or service offering at the custom printer we referred to streamlined jobcosting and orderentry processes enable customers to price and place orders with one phone call the “realtime” orderentry and ordertracking capabilities of the vanity fair unit’s salespeople have upgraded its customer service in both cases customers benefit from better service and sellers benefit from lower costs other companies add value by using automation to improve the exchange of information during sales calls the  salespeople in hercules’s fragrance and food ingredient group use their laptop pcs and a computer program called flavor briefs to consult with prospects on applications otherwise hercules salespeople would be unable to provide such detailed advice on their product line’s many applications the system saves the customer and the salesperson time and also furnishes a valuable service  in the budget process account for hidden costs and intangible benefits budgeting for an msp system entails overcoming three principal obstacles high perceived financial risk poorly understood benefits and biased capital budgeting systems first automating marketing and sales is costly a typical hardware and software outlay per salesperson ranges from  to —so automating the tasks of  field salespeople can cost between  and  in addition if the msp system must communicate with other corporate information systems it is likely to require the development of specialized minicomputer mainframe or communications networking software departmentlevel telemarketing or direct mail systems range in price from  to more than  sales or marketing management software may up the price another  to  of course the cost of tying all these pieces together depends on how many pieces there are where they are located and how they communicate it would not be unusual for a company with  salespeople as well as telemarketing fulfillment and direct mail operations to spend between  million and  million on integrated msp hardware and software but the budget process must anticipate and account for hidden costs too in a number of cases we studied inhouse information was so scattered and communications equipment so incompatible that simply preparing a customer list required a major effort other hidden costs include system customization expert consulting and enduser training depending on the circumstances these services can double or even triple the overall cost because malfunctioning of an automated marketing system can threaten a business’s revenue stream it’s advisable to budget for the cost of two systems—automated and manual—until the network has proved out naturally all these expenses ratchet up the perceived financial risk of msp automation on the other side of the equation estimating the full financial benefit of an msp system is extremely difficult tangible productivity gains like increases in selling time and cost reductions on telephone campaigns can be gauged fairly accurately but intangible productivity gains like better marketing decision making more responsive customer service and deeper understanding of customers are much more difficult to track still it would be a mistake to ignore them especially since capital budgeting processes are often biased against intangible productivity investments furthermore few marketing managers and even fewer sales managers know much about their companies’ capital budgeting processes—especially when huge investments in information technology are at stake senior executives have to take care that the process remains flexible enough to give msp automation a reasonable evaluation an msp system is a strategic investment for the whole corporation but unlike other assets that are consumed over time the more it is used the more valuable it becomes so it should be viewed as a longterm asset not as the expense of a functional group and needless to say senior management must match the scale of the company’s investment to the scale of the project otherwise fragmented marketing budgets will foster fragmented automation the result as noted above may be many msp rowboats with little or no coordination or compatibility  make any tests realistic because launching a fullscale network can be tremendously risky most companies hedge their bets first by piloting automation on small portions of their marketing operations a single function like telemarketing or personal selling is usually the test site if this pilot is successful the company adds more functions this rampup strategy however has serious drawbacks it permits no insight into the complexity of coordinating multiple marketing and sales activities though singlefunction solutions may yield gratifying returns evidence of their true worth may also stay hidden until they are combined into a system that demonstrates synergy consequently estimates of financial returns based on singlefunction pilots may be negatively biased finally critical performance limitations may remain hidden unless the complexity and scale of the test parallel the system’s actual use one big manufacturer’s telemarketing pilot ran flawlessly providing the telemarketers with a steady stream of calls and instant access to customer profiles and scripts but eventual integration of telemarketing with other msp networks seriously degraded the performance of the overall system every time the telemarketers asked for new information during a call they were confronted by blank computer screens for more than  seconds as the business manager put it “that’s a long time to talk about baseball” a company with a multichannel multimethod marketing system is better off with a pilot plan that automates a multifunctional subset of the marketing organization in this type of pilot an integrated system encompassing all marketing and sales functions is installed for a single division region product line or customer group this experience is likely to be more realistic than the singlefunction approach  pinpoint the roles and responsibilities of those selecting designing and operating the system even standard msp systems though they may be touted as offtheshelf products require extensive customization this necessity complicates the selection or design process in a number of ways the process requires expertise in technology computers data communications and software as well as in marketing and sales naturally a company’s existing mis systems are likely to constrain the choice or development of an msp system marketing professionals and mis professionals rarely speak a common language and they often approach marketing automation projects with different perspectives while marketing thinks about functionality eg will the system help perform marketing and sales tasks mis people often focus on technical considerations eg will the system interact with other corporate information systems who is responsible for ensuring the integrity of corporate data bases it’s senior management’s job to make sure that the mis and marketing professionals talk to each other and work together it’s not easy an mis group may automate its conception of marketing and sales only to discover later that the automated system does not actually work everybody knows of cases in which the mis department loads the sales force down with reams of report forms to complete and return to headquarters of course much of the requested information is irrelevant from the salespeople’s standpoint and the report forms end up in the same round file as the old lead cards during the long complex process of designing and implementing a major msp system responsibilities sometimes become diffuse and project accountability gets blurred in one case we know of poorly defined responsibilities for mis and marketing have caused big headaches bickering over cost allocations and database controls has made the company’s  million msp system useless the mis group will not allow marketing to access the corporation’s data bases but the marketing group’s computer budget is too low to keep the marketing data base uptodate not surprisingly headquarters viewed the entire msp development process as a marketing expense instead of a corporate investment  modify the technology and the organization to support the system as in every instance in which management implements new technology it must pay close attention to the attitudes of people in the organization in successful msp implementations that we have seen both the organization and the msp system have gone through an interactive process of change—altering the technology to fit the marketing and sales environment then altering the environment to fit the technology to be useful for example the msp data base obviously must contain accurate uptodate information because obtaining this information requires salespeople to use the system and to support the information collection process they have to become adept at using the new technology problems can result however if the endusers lack computer skills or if they are uninterested in using the system training can overcome skill problems if enough money is budgeted and enough time set aside but lack of interest is harder to deal with experience suggests that the best way to sell the sales staff on the network is to demonstrate that it can give every user something back that is by helping salespeople or telemarketers work more productively msp systems can boost not only the company’s sales but also their sales and their compensation for many companies postponement of automation of the marketing function may seem to be a good way of skirting a difficult decision but this donothing posture condemns the organization to being a marketing laggard it may also be a costly mistake early adopters of msp systems have gained superior competitive advantage compared with their “manual” competitors they perform selling tasks with greater economy and impact they know their customers better and can tailor their sales communications to supply just the right amount of sales stimulus at just the right time overall they craft and control their marketing programs more intelligently in the long run the competitive barriers they establish may change the nature of marketing in their industries in view of this impressive record some marketers about to embark on automation may embrace unrealistically high expectations but msp systems cannot work miracles they will not offset a poorly conceived or poorly executed marketing strategy they will not compensate for an inferior sales force and they will not sell inferior products complex msp systems are difficult to implement and the associated returns like any other lasting accomplishment have to be earned references  james brian quinn jordan j baruch and penny cushman paquette “technology in services” scientific american december  p   thayer c taylor “xerox who says you

electronic drum kits to audio interfaces mixing consoles and instrument amplifiers roland has been providing musicians and recording engineers with musical tools since the mids the heritage actually goes back even further ikutaro kakehashi founded ace electronic industries in  producing a range of combo organs guitar amps and effects pedals he was also contracted by hammond organ co to produce rhythm machines for their home organs kakehashi severed ties with both companies and founded roland in  modern sounds for modern music even though roland released their first synthesizer the sh in  it was the s that would firmly position them in the world of electronic music technology nowiconic instruments like the tr and tr rhythm machines the tb bassline synthesizer the jupiter and jxp analog synthesizers and the d digital synthesizer would all play a big part in shaping the sound of the s in the s detroit techno and rave culture inspired a whole new generation of electronic musicians in the usa to rediscover the potential of these instruments fast forward to today with a wide range of new instruments plus recreations of the classics and its clear that roland has influenced virtually every genre of electronic music innovations for musicians of all types rolands mastery of electronic music equipment extends well beyond synths and drum machines their first electronic piano the ep
