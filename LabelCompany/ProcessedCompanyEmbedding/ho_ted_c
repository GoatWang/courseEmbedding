through an advanced command portal providing centralized management and natural language querying to quickly verify threats and discover the extent of a breach for greatly accelerated resolution the company holds six us issued patents “our mission is to provide maximum visibility to what attackers want most – your data the security focus has traditionally been on perimeters and policies but existing technologies can’t keep pace with the variety of ways data is being accessed in the enterprise because of trends like mobility and private public and hybrid cloud adoption the end result is that the business’s most important assets are exposed” said ho “as ceo i’m dedicated to showing our clients how the datiphy platform can audit and protect their critical data resources and eager to lead this company as it embarks on the next phase of growth” as the former cofounder and accomplished ceo of gigamon ted brings a wealth of successful startup experience to datiphy he has a strong

methodologies “i am pleased and excited to announce ted as ceo his leadership will allow us to continue to innovate and eliminate the breachtodiscovery gap that is causing massive damage to organizations and their brand reputation” said lin “organizations will continue to be attacked by all kinds of nefarious actors our goal is to pinpoint when the breach begins and to provide intuitive context around the attack to stop it before significant damage is done” datiphy audits every data transaction rather than a sample of transactions thereby dramatically improving the accuracy of data
