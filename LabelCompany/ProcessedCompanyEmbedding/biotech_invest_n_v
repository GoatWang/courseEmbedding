specific dsdna quantification uvvisbased cdrop™ method vs picogreen® fluorescent assay precise quantification and normalization of isolated genomic dna is critical for advanced molecular testing in life science research and molecular diagnostics uvvis based quantification has long been the method of choice mainly because of its convenience however determining the dna concentration based on the absorbance at nm suffers from interference of components such as rna proteins and phenols alternative methods such as the picogreen® based quantit™ assay based on fluorescence enhancement upon binding with dsdna have been developed to address this issue view white paper  microvolume protein quantification using the dropsense droplet plate reader the measurement of protein concentration in aqueous samples is an important assay in biochemistry research and protein production facilities spectrophotometric protein quantification assays are commonly used methods to rapidly determine the concentration of a protein they utilize the direct uv absorbance of the protein at nm in combination with its extinction coefficient or an indirect dyebased methods like bca lowry and bradford assays view white paper  dropsense and its dropplates a versatile tool for nucleic acid and protein droplet quantification as the demand for molecular tests increases automated systems for biomolecule isolation and sample analysis are becoming popular these facilitate integration of the complete molecular test in a full automatic setup with liquid robots and barcoded sample tracking resulting in a significant higher throughput while minimizing tedious manual repetitive tasks the trinean technology is a unique combination of the dropsense droplet plate reader the well dropplate microfuidic consumables and the dropquant analytical software enabling direct quantification of small biomolecule samples in these high throughput automated workflow view white paper  droplet uvvis quantification of native proteins in biopharmaceutical processing biopharmaceuticals are mainly produced by microbial fermentation or in animal cell cultures as a consequence a cascade of procedures including purification and characterization are required throughout the processing chain to obtain the protein at the desired level of purity and potency within these processes quantification of the protein of interest is mandatory at critical steps to maintain confidence in the processing results and fidelity in the end product view white paper  quantification of histagged igg antibodies after imac nicolumn purification trinean introduces a new cdrop™ application suited for the quantification od of igg antibodies and derivatives like fab fragments during purification by imac nicolumns using imidazolecontaining buffers view white paper dyefree quantification of oragene®saliva dna extracts using the trinean dropsense® droplet reader and cdrop™ spectral analysis software saliva samples collected with oragene® selfcollection kits from dna genotek offer a noninvasive and proven method for accessing high quality and quantity dna for genomic testing and analysis proper quantification of the extracted dna is a critical step for most downstream applications trinean has developed a specific quantification protocol for dna from oragenesaliva samples using the dropsense® droplet reader and the cdrop™ spectral decomposition software a comparative analysis using a picogreen® fluorescent quantification assay shows a comparable specificity for dsdna quantification since the readout of  samples with the dropsense is performed in  minutes without any prior mixing or incubation this technology is a viable alternative to fluorescent quantification assays view white paper  maxwell® blood purification kit app and maxwell® lev blood dna kit app a spectral content profiling application on the cdrop™ software is available for quantification and contamination analysis of dna isolations from blood using the maxwell®  blood dna purification kit and the maxwell® lev blood dna kit in this note we describe how to use this application and how to export and interpret the results view white paper  quantifying amplicons in nonpurified pcr reactions direct assessment of product yield the polymerase chain reaction pcr is a fundamental tool in molecular biology and clinical testing most genetic tests rely upon the power of pcr to enrich specific targetsequences prior to analysis analytical methods like sequencing are relatively expensive and labs want to minimize the resources spent on samples that dont meet the requirements of concentration and quality to deliver a reliable result view white paper  qiagen® ez tissue dna app a spectral content profiling application on the cdrop™ software is available for quantification and contamination analysis of dna isolations from cells using the qiagen® ez tissue dna kit in this note we describe how to use this application and how to export and interpret the results view white paper  cdrop protocol for trizol rna extract quantification and content qc this cdrop protocol is developed for specific rna quantification of extracts from

commercial available variants include the trizol® kit invitrogen tri reagent® mrc rnazoltm mrc and rna stattm teltest view white paper allpurpose protein sample qc using a novel microvolume platform with spectral content profiling software accurate total protein quantitation of purified proteins cell lysates affinitycolumn fractions or other complex protein samples is crucial for robust biochemical testing during biopharmaceutical development as well as production as the presence of chemicals doesnt allow simple a protein quantification more laborintensive alternatives for quantification are used examples are the colorimetric bradford or bca assay which negate to a large extent the presence of contaminants but require multiple steps and show variation depending on the sample composition and time point of measuring within the ongoing reaction view white paper precise nucleic acid quantification using labonachip spectroscopy and the cdrop quantification algorithm precise quantification and quality control of isolated genomic dna is critical for the success of downstream applications such as nextgeneration sequencing traditionally two quantification methods have been used routinely  uvvis spectroscopy and  fluorescencebased assays ie picogreen that utilize dna intercalating agents view white paper sample processing for the uk biobank genotyping project a project was initiated in  to perform snp genotyping on all uk biobank participants the aim of the project which was to be completed within an  month timeframe was to generate high quality genotype

share the decision to invest in pharmaceutical pharma or biotech stocks is a confusing one unless you have a keen knowledge of the basic operations and products of the company and how its securities trade on the market pharmaceutical companies range from large to small and they engage in a full array of activities from research and development rd to manufacturing and marketing medicines the compounds pharmaceutical companies manufacture are small molecules based on chemical or plant synthesis conversely biotech companies except for a few are generally small enterprises that engage solely in rd of medicines these companies use biotechnology to recreate the function of cells they use microorganisms and enzymes to develop largemolecule drugs that are used for a specific purpose because biotechs mimic cellular processes the length of time from research and development is extremely long averaging  years the rd process for both involves many clinical testing trials that yield specific data these trials are “blind” so that neither the companies nor the investors have any knowledge of the outcomes rd and stock impact biotech companies tend to be small with only one to a few compounds in development most of these companies operate with losses because the time to develop is so long and the rd processes are extremely costly because of this dynamic biotech companies tend to find partners for financial support usually through venture capital universities pharmaceutical companies or the government despite this when a company’s compound is in clinical trials if the “endpoints” expected data are not met the stocks can plummet but if the endpoints are exceeded the stocks can soar manyfold as a result investors in biotech companies need to be willing to tolerate a great deal of volatility while pharmaceutical companies also experience the costly and lengthy rd process including the ups and downs during clinical trials they are usually able to withstand the volatility better because these companies tend to have many more product lines producing revenue that covers the rd costs therefore their stocks are comparatively more stable and considered safer investments when a biotech company finally has a marketable drug it needs to get a marketing and sales arm this is accomplished by either building one or in many cases partnering with a larger biotech or pharma company many pharmaceutical companies have alliances with biotech companies adding revenues through the sale of the biotech’s drug without the costs or time associated with development  a nice boost to their top line competition competition is one area that impacts pharma companies to a greater degree than biotech companies because pharmaceuticals are chemical processes thought to be more easily replicated competition generally comes in the form of generic drugs which can be introduced to the market after the branded drugs patents expire the length of each patent varies but it is usually long enough for pharma companies to recoup rd costs and produce healthy profits when a generic drug is introduced to the market the branded drug pricing is  lost drug prices for the generic can be up to  lower than the branded pricing “me too” drugs competitive products that work in a different manner for the same disease can erode market share and pricing as well biotech companies had not been faced with any “biosimilar” or generic competition but since the passage of legislation in  biosimilars can become an increasingly competitive threat to biotech companies many issues exist in terms of determining the course of development for biosimilar competitors so biotech companies because they face such steep costs and lengthy processes associated with rd are hoping that biosimilars will not be a nearterm competitive threat investment theses there are two basic investment theses based on time horizon and risk tolerance pharmaceutical investment if you are less risk tolerant and not willing to wait for longterm drug development then an investment in a pharmaceutical company makes more sense the drivers of pharmaceutical stocks include prescription data new drug pipelines strategic alliances and ma activity competition and reimbursement changes these stocks tend to be more stable because some of these drivers are predictable in addition drug companies tend to have a larger revenue base with multiple product lines so they trade based on profits unforeseen shortterm threats include changes to medicare pricing which tend to impact the pricing for many consumers unforeseen longterm threats include negative medical impacts from taking the drugs such as deathlawsuits as well as loss of patents allowing competitors to come to market sooner biotech investment if you are a risk taker and willing to wait for drug development while withstanding the potential volatility generally associated with biotech stocks then an investment in a biotech company may suit your style biotech stocks generally trade based on drug data including clinical trial failures competition or regulatory obstacles if the drug data misses its expected endpoint a biotechs stock can lose most of its value in one day conversely if a drug meets its expected endpoint a stock can soar by double and triple digits that day some companies that have strong partners or are financially stable may be able to withstand setbacks but many companies may not and the investment can go bust valuation pharmaceutical stocks typically trade at a large discount to biotech stocks the historical mean forward pe multiple is x from  through march  for pharma as compared to the high x to x or more for biotechs because many biotechs are small and operating with losses they are valued using pricetosales ratio psr or enterprisevaluetosales evsales however according to one wall street analyst “there is no meaningful relationship between valuation and market cap or revenues” source merrill lynch back to basics presentation as such valuation is a bit unreliable and meaningless with some of these stocks the bottom line both pharma and biotech stocks face a costly process that when successful can produce extremely profitable products however the process is extremely unpredictable which for a small biotech firm can prove all too detrimental and unrecoverable pharmaceutical companies due to their larger size and diversified revenue base are typically able to withstand setbacks and failures competition is more relevant and costly to pharmaceutical companies creating a need for strong pipelines and nonorganic revenues such as through ma or alliances consideration of these key themes can provide the basis for making a prudent investment trending the trump economy
