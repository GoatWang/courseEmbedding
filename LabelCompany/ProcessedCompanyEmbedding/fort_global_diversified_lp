history exploration yves balcer and sanjiv kumar fort’s cofounders have extensive academic training with  phds and  masters degrees between them spanning disciplines from economics and mathematics to statistics and operations research yves followed by sanjiv led the investment division of the world bank as senior managers overseeing the investment team tasked with managing the bank’s largest portfolio fort was founded upon a simple premise statistical approaches improve human decisionmaking while the experience of managing a  billion portfolio was invaluable we felt that practical experience alone was not enough human intuition should be combined with statistical expertise in order to produce systematic strategies we founded fort with this mission yves we wanted to test our theories in the real world no matter how confident we might be in our research there is no substitute for actual implementation founding fort was that step sanjiv development in  with the support of their families yves and sanjiv launched fort they immediately faced the challenge of building a hedge fund from the ground up operational infrastructure is as important to clients as investment performance without the benefit of the world bank’s infrastructure to support them yves and sanjiv did what had always come naturally to them and what has become a hallmark of fort’s ethos – they built what they needed while large firms had the resources to hire personnel to assist with trade reconciliation allocation accounting and other middle and backoffice functions yves and sanjiv built automated solutions to ensure they could compete as the firm’s reputation and resources grew yves and sanjiv invested in human capital employees with skills and experience essential to help them further their vision managing institutional assets requires a strong cutting edge infrastructure we have invested consistently in fort’s human capital systems and processes to maintain the highest standards we have steadily developed differentiated strategies that are designed to generate attractive returns over a wide range of market conditions sanjiv growth today fort’s team has grown to over  professionals located in washington dc and new york the investment team led by yves and sanjiv has developed numerous systematic investment strategies in both futures and equity markets using fundamental and technical analysis these investment strategies are accessed by institutional investors of all types across the globe although the team is larger now the core values of the firm still remain an entrepreneurial spirit a dedication to clients and an innovative approach to investment management it is our desire to build for the next generation sanjiv and i are excited about the future of fort and we look forward to the continued development of innovative investment solutions yves our methodology menu methodology we believe that factors influencing human discretionary decisionmaking lead to persistent market opportunities for systematic trading strategies humans generally have a difficult time analyzing large amounts of data effectively and dispassionately human decisionmaking is strongly influenced by two factors the most recent experiences and the most adverse when under stress humans become irrational and overly riskaverse missing opportunities for future gains these behavioral biases create opportunity for systematic trading models especially those that are designed to adapt to changes in human behavior approach research our approach we design our trading models to be systematic adaptive unique and robust systematic fort exclusively designs fully systematic strategies that seek to generate attractive risk adjusted returns over market cycles fort relies on its deep experience in the markets and expertise in statistics and mathematics to develop quantitative strategies all fort strategies are built to systematically adjust to key factors over time as the world and markets change unique fort has a history of approaching complex opportunities from a different perspective the founders combination of significant market experience and advanced academic training in economics statistics and mathematics has spurred the generation of novel ideas and strategies forts culture celebrates creative research endeavors adaptive adaptability is inherent in all of fort’s strategies the models shift key factors over time as markets develop and evolve fort’s dynamic risk allocation methodology serves as a systematic way to attack the challenge of changing market dynamics faced by all systematic methods this proprietary methodology continuously shifts the allocation of risk in the strategies to markets and indicators according to a forecast of riskadjusted profitability robust robustness is an essential component of any systematic strategy fort has consistently developed models that are focused on the future as opposed to fitting the past fort’s focus on statistically robust strategies has resulted in durability of the models over time fort seeks to develop strategies that perform with a high degree of stability over time even in the face of extreme market dynamics research fort’s research has always focused on developing strategies that trade liquid products are uncorrelated to broader equity indices are fully systematic are relatively parameter free so as to be robust and adaptable to different market environments and are uncorrelated to existing fort strategies fort has a disciplined and structured approach to research first identifying unique opportunities then developing strategies to generate attractive riskadjusted returns around those opportunities this is accomplished by leveraging fort’s historical expertise in the application of statistical analysis to complex market structures throughout the process there is consistent and robust outofsample testing individual strategies can take years to develop and perfect before fort will initiate live trading of the strategy with either proprietary or client capital collaborative we use a hubandspoke model research ideas are pursued independently but collectively refined all members of the staff are encouraged to investigate research opportunities rigorous once established as potentially viable research ideas are rigorously vetted backtesting is thorough and verified by independent staff members research ideas must be systemized focused research is aimed at finding strategies that are uncorrelated with fort’s existing strategies as well as broader market indices we seek intuitive statistically robust ideas that are likely to persist we believe what makes fort unique is that we do not generally tinker with our models once they are complete we build them to be selfadaptive in a systematic way and we allow them the freedom to do that our research is focused on creating models that complement our existing strategies this is how our trading systems are designed to evolve the addition of complementary approaches rather than by intervening with what’s established yves balcer careers at fort menu careers our goal is to bring
