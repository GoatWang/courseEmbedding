technology corporation is headquartered in new hartford ny legal help par new product and great riskreward  par technology corporation nysepar  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»par new product and great riskrewardjul  about par technology par bottom up investing tech growth value momentumpar technology corporation nysepar par or the company has not had the best financial performance track record over the past  years the net income numbers have been low considering the revenue growth thus the year average valuations are influenced by the subpar operating expense management if management can lower the cost of revenue or decreases rd spending and sga a total of  basis points as a percentage of revenue the company would command a higher valuation that said cash flow from operations could get back to normal this year further the companys new everserv  series should start to positively impact revenue in  and  thus with solid expense management par should earn a higher pricesales and pricebook multiple additionally as par gains scale through higher revenue the cost of revenue could decline i consider this a speculative investment consequently im looking for an upside of about  to  with risk of  the risk and reward are calculated from a share price of  that would put the pricesales ratio at roughly  the pricebook ratio would be about  the priceearnings ratio would be around  based on the forward priceearnings those valuations are if we get  of upside as a point of clarification i define a speculative investment as one that investors use a stop loss level or an investment that isnt buy and hold the second point of clarification the rewardrisk ratio is  at the  level and  at the  level including a trailing stop loss this could be an investment with close to a  rewardrisk ratio hence this is a speculative investment with a great riskreward company profile par has operations in two distinct business segments hospitality and government pars hospitality business representing approximately  of consolidated revenue for  provides technology solutions including hardware software and a range of support services to businesses and organizations in the global hospitality industries pars government business representing approximately  of consolidated revenue for  provides a range of technical services for the us department of defense and other federal state and local governmental organizations par provides information technology solutions to two markets within its hospitality segment restaurants and hotels as a leading vendor to the restaurant market par has developed committed longterm relationships with the industrys three largest organizations mcdonalds corporation yum brands inc and the subway franchisees of doctors associates inc in the hotelresortspa market par through the companys psms subsidiary is a leading global provider of software solutions for a variety of property types including citycenter hotels destination spa and golf resorts cruise ships and casino hotels risk factors future operating results are difficult to predict and are subject to fluctuations the stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future a decline in the volume of purchases made by any one of the companys major customers would materially adversely affect the business an inability to produce new products that keep pace with technological developments and changing market conditions could result in a loss of market share par may not be able to meet the unique operational legal and financial challenges that relate to international operations which may limit the growth of the business liquidity and solvency with a company the size of par it is important to check the liquidity and solvency position the liquidity and solvency position are both solid at the end of the latest quarter the current ratio was  the quick ratio was  financial leverage was  and debtequity was  cash and shortterm investments as a percentage of total assets was  intangible assets were  of total assets in conclusion liquidity and solvency should not be an issue with par in the near future valuations in this instance a comparison to the sp s valuations would be meaningless thus in this situation i will use the time series and year average valuations to value the shares of par par par y avg priceearnings  pricebook   pricesales   pricecash flow   pricecash flow uses year average on a time series basis par is undervalued and heading towards fairly valued relative to the year average par is fairly valued i conclude that par is moderately undervalued but as previously mentioned the last  years have not been the best in pars history thus the year average valuations are probably skewed to the downside par introduced the everserv  series its flagship pos platform in  i think that will act as a tailwind for revenue growth and net income growth in  and  as a consequence par could command a higher

like to turn the call over to par cfo bryan menar to give further details on our financial performance for the quarter bryan bryan menar thank you don and good afternoon everyone product revenue for the quarter was  million up  million a  increase compared to q  during the quarter increase in product revenue was primary driven by hardware sold to our tier  customers largely in mcdonalds which represented  of total revenue in q  versus  in q  additionally the hardware associated with deployments of brink pos increased approximately  million versus q  offsetting these increases was a  million decrease in jack in the box as we lapped their  rollout which was completed in the first half of  service revenue for the quarter was  million up  million a  increase compared to q  we continued to expand our recurring revenue base which includes both softwarerelated services and hardware support contracts recurring revenue for the quarter was  million or  of total consolidated revenue compared to  in q  recurring revenue increased  million a  increase compared to q  due to software up  million and hardware support contracts up  million we continued to gain momentum with the deployment of brink pos noting  increase of software as a service compared to prior year we exited the quarter with approximately  million of annual recurring revenue from software as a service contracts contract revenue from our government business was  million down  million a  decrease compared to q  this decrease was driven by the wind down of a large multiyear contract within our programmatching service offering contract backlog continues to be significant noting total backlog of over  million as of march   up  million compared to q  and down  million from the previous quarter now to review our margin performance product margin for the quarter was  relatively flat versus the  in q  service margin for the quarter was  compared to  in q  service margins were up primarily due to growth in our service as a service platform depot repair and call center service offerings government contract margin for the quarter was  compared to  in q  the favorable variance is the result of the shift in revenue mix from pmo to the valueadded product offerings of intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and mission support gaap sga was  million up  million versus q  primarily due to costs related to favorable yearoveryear financial performance such as commissions and bonus accrual in addition there were investments to professional development in our sales organization and advisoryrelated fees nongaap sga was  million up  million versus q  research and development expenses were  million up  million versus q  primarily driven by software investments made to support acceleration of our brink and surecheck product lines now to provide information on the companys cash flow and balance sheet position for the  months ended march   cash used by continuing operations was  million primarily driven by amortization of deferred revenue from the customer deposits received in q  for deployments in the first half of  cash used in investing activities from operations was  million for the  months ended march   versus cash used of  million for the  months ended december   in q  capital expenditures of  million were primarily for pars new erp system in addition to improvements to our owned and leased properties capitalized software was  million and was associated with investments for our restaurantretail software platforms cash provided by financing activities from operations was  million for the  months ended march   versus cash used of  for the  months ended december   as of march   inventory balance was  million a decrease of  million from december   primarily due to execution of our tier  product deployments inventory turns were x for domestic and international operations which is up x versus q of  accounts receivable increased  million compared to december   reflecting the increase in revenue versus q  restaurantretail segment days sales outstanding improved from  days as of december  to  days as of march  government days sales outstanding increased slightly to  days versus  days as of december  this concludes my formal remarks and i would like to turn it back to don donald foley thanks bryan as promised i will provide you with some insight in par behind the numbers first ill address our government segments strategic plan highlights of this plan are first objective  is to focus on and invest in both our valueadded lines of business both of our  valueadded lines of business that rely heavily on the skills of our talented employees in particular our hightechnology intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance line of business and our mission systems line of business which provides on site a government locations missioncritical services in particular operations and maintenance services worldwide objective  is to maintain our pmo services line of business in which we provide quick reaction capabilities to rapidly procure and deploy critically needed products to many us government locations regarding objective  our valueadded lines of business i am pleased to report that we have increased our valueadded isr line of business by  versus  q our initiatives to diversify our isr line of business at darpa the defense advanced research project agency and at various letter intelligence agencies are paying off in particular we increased our revenue with these agencies by  versus  q were now a key player in the evolving media forensic technology initiatives at darpa by investing in our proposal center by hiring additional experienced business development staff by improving our proposal capture processes and support tools we now have  proposals which have been submitted and are awaiting government decision regarding objective  maintaining our pmo services revenue we have not as yet replaced our large indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity eagle intelx procurement vehicle as such our pmo services revenues have declined looking at our government segment business as a whole i am happy to report that we successfully increased the revenue in our  valueadded lines of business and that our margins have increased to  from  in  q im also pleased to report that our contract backlog has risen to  million an increase of  million and an increase of  over  q now turning our attention to the restaurantretail strategic plan and the  q restaurantretail performance in anticipation of changing market dynamics including customer demand for cloudbased technology to reduce infrastructure costs to improve labor metrics and to gain realtime visibility through business intelligence par has developed and is executing to our strategic plan in addition the consumer base demand for frictionless ordering and payment is increasing interest in our solutions the numbers presented by bryan demonstrate our leadership in the hardware and services area yet these product  hardware product growth numbers masked the progress were making in our brink and surecheck software initiatives the growth in brink and surecheck software as a service revenue continues at an exponential rate in q  we reported a  increase over q  brink pos monthly recurring revenue at the end of march  grew  as compared to the end of

capabilities barcode and rfid code scanning as well as intuitive user interface surecheck and brink together drive our strategy of annuitizing our business by increasing marginrich software recurring revenues for par our focus and execution strength has influenced the growth on our recurring revenue portions of our business in the past quarter our company grew total recurring revenues by  over the

closing i want to thank our stakeholders for their confidence in our future and extend our appreciation to our employees for their hard work their dedication their commitment and their achievements thank you for participating in todays call this concludes our formal remarks and i will now turn the call over to the operator to start the qa session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of howard brous with wunderlich securities howard brous don first of all congratulations on your recent appointment and secondly congratulations to you and karen on a good quarter what i would like to talk about is to address the items in the k on the internal investigation material weakness the disturbing thing about all of this is that and im quoting from the k the investigation also revealed that certain members of the upper management knew or should have known of the questionable conduct in  and  but failed to take action to prevent or correct such conduct and it continues so my questions surround and my concern is really this issue was there any bribery of government officials in singapore donald foley first howard one thing since you noted that i  and i thank you for your kind words since you noted that i didnt join until april  i really want to thank karen and her entire team for their performance in the first quarter i had nothing to do with it regarding your second question other than what we disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the sec including our k and our soontobereleased or justreleased q we cannot comment on an ongoing investigation howard brous okay let me continue and maybe some of these questions you might be able to answer were any employees of par terminated in china singapore or the united states as a result of this donald foley no its our practice not to comment on individual people i can assure you were fully cooperating with the investigation and were taking necessary remedial actions howard brous okay in china and singapore what were the revenues in  of each and  and currently donald foley im going to defer to  who wants to take the question bryan menar ill take it so total international as you know  for instance total international for this quarter was  of our total revenue for this quarter versus like  to for the last china singapore is a subset of that as we have  different regions so its  i dont have the exact number in front of me but i believe its somewhere between a  to  howard brous each year  and  bryan menar correct us dollar howard brous okay and currently same thing bryan menar correct howard brous okay don even though i know youre new but clearly youve been on the board and youre aware of it has the board completed their reviews and as far as youre concerned all the issues of management changes been accomplished and are there any other potential management changes as a result of this donald foley if youre talking about the csuite we have an outstanding csuite and im very comfortable with it over time we may fill out some positions in finance legal or in other places as we need them but i do not anticipate any changes in the csuite howard brous okay what are the costs have been to date on this investigation and do you expect any additional costs going forward irrelevant of what the doj might or might not do bryan menar yes so howard ill take that as well so sure you probably saw on both the q and the k that was filed a bit early for that for the quarter it was just under  million about  related to this that gets us to a later date on this about  million which is primarily really right in q of last year and q of this year the investigation is not officially complete its primarily very close to being complete it could be  we cant comment on exactly what additional costs would be in regards to q howard brous okay all right lastly do you have any sense of what the doj or timing on the doj and the costs of potential fine could be as a result of these actions bryan menar no we did an analysis on that howard as well working with both our external counsel on that as well and looking at  or we note a reason on this on an explanation on that and we cannot put another and yes you can actually see and thats what we actually referenced in the q howard brous the q is not out yet so i havent seen it donald foley correct it would be premature for us to actually put it an estimated amount on there howard brous all right because my only personal concern clearly is its certainly in the ncta issues that it could be x your financial gain as a maximum thats rather expensive so thats been my concern and im going to assume that other than that for the bulk of these issues they have been resolved is that a fair comment donald foley well certainly our general counsel  we cannot comment on an ongoing investigation but i will remind  i think its fair to say that we have reported okay that there has been no material effect on any of our past reported financials i hope that gives you some comfort to date okay no guarantees for the future but to date howard brous no i understand that there is a liability of a potential fine down the road with the doj i get that all right all of the other questions i have about numbers ill talk with bryan offline operator operator instructions our next question will come from the line of sam bergman with bayberry asset samuel bergman congratulations don on your new  on a new position of ceo so im going to start with the least important division to me anyway if we look at the run rate of government whats your expectations for the rest of the year just the low point for government sales or not donald foley well we dont give guidance samuel bergman the backlog is pretty strong so i would assume  i was surprised to see that the low numbers in government so can you give us a little bit more color on that bryan menar yes but  where i think i can point you toward is what ive always looked at in government business are our leading indicators our booktobill during the last quarter  or im sorry for the trailing  months which is even better than the last quarter our booktobill is  which is excellent in the industry we did report despite the loss of the pmo revenues were essentially flat in q in terms of our profit and i think  those numbers give me comfort no guarantee but these leading indicators give me comfort going forward i hope that helps samuel bergman so on the backlog ending this quarter is it down from the fourth quarter i thought the fourth quarter was higher donald foley the backlog is up the backlog  youre talking bryan menar you look through the year itself its down samuel bergman no no no im talking  im only specifically talking fourth quarter versus first quarter of  bryan menar correct so its down from q  million which is up over  donald foley yes the government is  i can comment  i have spent a lot of my life in that area the government is quite cyclical although with the new  new administrations are always tough in getting started my experience over the years is that even in a normal transition that it takes time to get the senior positions filled and im not talking cabinet members im really talking the senior people who run various agencies and who are their lead support staff especially in acquisition and in setting policy we did have  we avoided the government shutdown or routed the continuing resolution so theres a certainly has been slowness in government decisions through what we call our q okay which would be government q they start obviously october  with the  billion increase in the defense part of the budget that was recently approved im hoping that the government will start to make decisions on the  proposals that weve had sitting or waiting government award bryan menar which is an increase from q  donald foley yes which is also an increase so both  especially seasonally adjusted our contract backlog is high and our proposals awaiting award are high so it doesnt guarantee anything but it certainly gives me comfort plus the fact that weve been able to run the business okay by shifting revenue from really much lower i mean in our  where weve lost a lot of the revenue is in our pmo services organization which we basically help the government with some quick reaction capabilities i mean we really buy other peoples products okay many of them sophisticated systems whether theyre drones or the drones with sensors on them and we deploy them to various sites throughout the globe and we do it very efficiently but most of that revenue is other peoples products that we get very low margins on so im very comfortable with maintaining our profit line i think revenue will be a challenge subject to how fast the government reacts on our  proposals and were submitting more bryan menar correct so i mean  and then sam if i can just  just one comment on that so the backlog is down from q but basically proposals awaiting awards is up versus q its the timing within that samuel bergman okay lets go on to surecheck can you give us any kind of number on the run rate yearly for surecheck like you did on brink karen sammon at this point i cannot give you the same kind of numbers that were delivering on brink were anticipating that as we come to the second half of the year and specifically by  that were going to start providing you with the quarterover quarter and sequential quarter numbers as were building up our metrics we have been reporting on the number of devices that were tracking as they vary from industry to industry and site to site and were starting to get a good cadence of the growth as you know the software is aligned with the hardware theres  attach rate with our hardware and software as we deploy solutions in the different industries that were addressing so its a little premature right now but were looking to provide that kind of a visibility into the growth again as we go to the second half of the year and definitely within  donald foley one thing to note too is that with surecheck we have a number of sites that we started with that are basically licenses that we host and we have converted to now a software as a service and so well have to separate those  for you the next time and make a distinction between the  were really focusing our strategic plan in surecheck on our software as a service with recurring monthly revenue karen sammon and actually thats really a good point so as were releasing our nextgen software surechecks software platform were intending to convert our existing base to recurring revenue so they came to market as an enterprise license and as a traditional onprem licensing and were working to convert them and thats not a guarantee but that is our objective so everything  but everything going forward with all of our new customers since the beginning of  has been saas samuel bergman so are you expecting the walmart license to turn into a saas model karen sammon we dont have any guarantees and were looking to implement the new platform and if they adopt that platform thats what we  that would be our objective but theres no guarantee that thats going to occur samuel bergman the last question is on brink can you give us any more color whether don you can do it for us or karen again on the tier  that you said were very interested in going forward with the brink product donald foley ill try one thing that impressed me first we have a pilot we have a site pilot going with dairy queen no i cant  oh with a large customer and its possible we could extend that pilot but ill let karen continue karen sammon yes so were working with a number of tier s and theyre in various stages as i reported we have  client that we have on a pilot thats extending and if that goes well then we would begin implementation in the fourth quarter and into  the second client that were working with is going into an extended pilot starting  it already started were adding stores in may and june with the expectation that that could accelerate in the latter half of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter so theres  that are relatively close others are in various stages of discussion and negotiation samuel bergman so those  tier s that you talked about can you give us quantity of sites if they were to get the brink products for all their sites going forward karen sammon yes so theyre in  theyre close to  sites realistically speaking i mean that would take several years to implement all of them some of them have more corporate stores than others and the corporate stores would be the earliest to go kind of like with the five guys that you experienced with us so we also would earn the hunting license as we call it to be able to go after the remainder of the stores and so i believe over the   period that that could contribute the plus stores in that period maybe a little more samuel bergman and five guys is  can you just give us an update on five guys is that  complete or less than that karen sammon i cant do the math in my head but we have roughly  of the sites deployed with the  happening in the remainder of this year indiscernible im looking  stores donald foley yes close to indiscernible karen sammon yes we might  so were ongoing we just had a really great conference with the five guys community and look to implement the number of stores in the second half of this year operator our next question will come from the line of joe vidich with manalapan oracle joseph vidich i was wondering if  with regard to the erp system when the implementation will be complete and you had talked about an annual run rate savings after its implemented and i was just wondering if you could refresh me on what that number was karen sammon yes we just implemented the crm phase of the  of our erp implementation we expect to go live with the erp in the later part of the summer and then convert our services platform towards the end of the year and the beginning of  were looking to reduce expenses by i think i said  million over the course of the  period so on an annualized basis and then were  that was our initial estimate and were still going through our change management analysis and looking to see how we can optimize our organization and look for efficiencies to reduce expense across the board operator our next question will come from the line of indiscernible unidentified analyst my question is for don can you talk about why you wanted to become ceo at par donald foley well im really glad you asked that i honestly dont like talking about myself but since youre forcing me since you asked for it yes i thought a lot about it but par its part of my dna after graduating with a doctorate in  in electrical and computer engineering par was my first real job and i did my dissertation in the area of patent analysis and recognition and thats what par stands thats what it was before we shortened the name i came when we were in an old building and  years later we went  we had an ipo at december   ill remember it for the rest of my life so thats how i got my beginning but i came because im excited there are very few industries where you get an opportunity to have  to service a market that has exponential growth and when i looked at  ive been on the board since january   ive been a consultant to the board since january   i came back i think in  to help government put together a plan to revitalize its hightech business when i looked at the strategic plan that karen had put in place im excited im as excited as i was when i first came here in  and that excitement  and i look at what we might do surecheck market in its maturity is behind the software as a service market that this disruption is taking place in the restaurant industry but i see great potential in that too so its the excitement of working with some very bright people its the excitement to build be part of small card of something that i  no guarantees that i think we can grow im very impressed with our new cfo that really has great experience at  from goldman sachs and chobani and then our general counsel also with significant experience including but not limited to chobani so working with bright people in emerging marketplaces a chance to help implement a strategy that karen and her team presented and the board approved i guess its excitement thats my answer its excitement unidentified analyst and then one other question on brink now i know it was a great quarter yearoveryear but it looks like sequentially if my numbers are right inflations were down from  through  and i think bookings were down from about  to  is that seasonality or can you guys talk a little bit more about that bryan menar ill start that weve seen that in the past couple of years the start of each year has been a slower period of january and february as we stand here i mean the team has had pretty good bookings simply the bookings themselves have been over  for the same period installations were let me say just under  the team is still with the booking that came in doing more than strong went
