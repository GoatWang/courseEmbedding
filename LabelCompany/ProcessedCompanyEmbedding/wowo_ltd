edited and summarized from the full s referenced above business wowos goal is to make direct interaction possible between local lifestyle merchants and their target customers through unique offerings wowo helps local customers discover food shops activities and events near the places where they live and work while supporting local merchants to grow their businesses exponentially and raise awareness of their brands wowo operates one of chinas leading thirdparty ecommerce platforms focusing on local entertainment and lifestyle services such as restaurants movie theaters and beauty salons wowo does not compete with its merchant clients by offering its own goods and services nor does wowo keep inventory of any merchandise wowos unique platform allows local merchants to customize and arrange their online stores make direct sales to their target customers and process a large volume of online sales for consumption at their brick and mortar stores according to iresearch wowos platform represents the largest ecommerce platform for local lifestyle services in terms of number of merchants and registered users as of june   as of september   wowo has also established a nationwide network of merchant service centers to support local businesses in  major cities and population centers across china wowos platform consists of an ecommerce website wowo mall a mobile commerce infrastructure wowo mobile and an electronic management system wowo ems the three components of wowos platform are designed to create an integrated network that enhances the interaction between businesses and consumers that reinforces brand awareness and fosters repeat customers for its merchant clients wowos wowo mall website located at com is used to promote and market its companys brand eminence and complete eservice platform by exhibiting its merchant clients online stores and introduce certain selected services and products potential customers may then be directed to tuancom to obtain information on the latest attractive offerings available through such merchants wowo began its business as a group buying website under the brand wowo buy located at tuancom in march  wowo quickly found that the group buying business model did not fully meet the needs of local service providers while the group buying business model often helps merchants increase their sales by selling extra capacity wowo believes it does not as a standalone offering significantly promote brand awareness for the merchants or create customer loyalty to the merchants merchants also face additional margin pressure from the fees charged by these group buying sites that could further erode their margins for example flash sales conducted by thirdparty group buying websites often promote the brands of the websites over the brands of the merchants at the same time local merchants continue to have limited branding power or control over the marketing direction by june  wowo augmented its wowo buy model with its promotional portal at com to complete its wowo mall wowo mall not only permits merchants to establish their own online stores it also allows the merchants to increase their branding power by providing them with customizable features to establish the look and feel they want to be associated with their brands in the third quarter of  wowo hosted and provided operating services to over  local entertainment and lifestyle merchants on its websites intellectual property as of september   wowo has  trademarks registered with the trademark office of the state administration for industry and commerce and wowo had registered  domain names including com and tuancom these websites are not a part of this prospectus competition the ecommerce service providers in china can be categorized into two sectors one sector consists of selfoperated vendors modeled after amazon nasdaqamzn and groupon nasdaqgrpn including jdcom meituancom and the group buy channel of dianpingcom another sector consists of thirdparty platform operators such tmallcom which focuses on the sales of goods and us focusing on sales of local services  shareholders preipo maodong xu  xiaoyi niu

ferrari f with the whole wowo’s range and i couldn’t be happier even here where people tend not to wash their own cars i love doing mine with these products especially the hot wax even in this environment it’s so easy to apply and remove even when it’s so hot” johnathan neil dubai f cs “i look after my ferrari f with the whole wowo’s range and i couldn’t be happier” “i popped into the wowo’s factory to replace some of my existing products the staff knew more about the car care than i thought was possible i left there with a selection of products and i can say my car has never looked so good the beading off the wax shampoo alone is just crazy” kevin gray focus st “the beading off the wax shampoo alone is just crazy” “i won one of wowo’s competitions on social media to win a tub of their signature wax i then bought a bottle of the awesome foam at the same time and i can easily say the foam is crazy thick with great cleaning and the wax is one of the easiest waxes i have ever used and the finish and smoothness of the surface is second to none highly recommended” mark kelly competition winner “…the wax is one of the easiest waxes i have ever used and the finish and smoothness of the surface is second to none…” “it’s not often i get excited about car care products as owning a bodyshop i have been using good products every day for years but the wowo’s range is so easy to use with great results that i can get excited about cleaning my own car again” robert macdonald rm bodywork “…the wowo’s range is so easy to use with great results…” “i have used a lot of
