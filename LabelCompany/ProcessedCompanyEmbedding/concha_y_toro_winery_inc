longterm horizon dividend growth investing valuesummarythe consistent historical strength of concha y toro has not faded and with a burgeoning market for chilean wines the future looks brightq  was a rough one for the company as they faced serious pressure from exchange rate variation and adverse weather conditionsi will be keeping my eye out for an entry point into this solid company as their current headwinds are temporary and they present long term valueintroduction in april   of fund managers believed us stocks to be overvalued according to the bank of america merrill lynch monthly fund manager survey that was three months ago and since then valuations have continued to rise in the us because of this i along with many investors began looking at foreign equities to find value plays while many are looking to europe i decided to take a look into south america to see if i could find lesser known names although i didn’t find exactly what i was looking for i instead found one of the strongest and oldest wine producers in the world that only a few analysts on the street cover today i want to dive into viña concha y toro sa nysevco a company that was founded in  by don melchor de santiago concha y toro and his wife emiliana subercaseaux the business began when don melchor brought over prized vines from the bordeaux region of france and opened a vineyard in chile today the company exports to over  countries and has become a wellrecognized player in the industry they currently distribute under the brands don melchor amelia terrunyo marqués de casa concha trío casillero del diablo sunrise y frontera and have been trading on new york stock exchange since october   source concha y toro viña concha y toro is a battle tested and well diversified producer and distributer of mostly nonpremium wines they have faced serious challenges of late and thus their stock price has remained fairly flat still their historic strengths have been unwavering and they will present a solid longterm value play once they overcome the temporary headwinds they have faced in  and the beginning of  historic strength and burgeoning market viña concha y toro has been one of the most consistent wine producers in the world for years they have had steady asset growth seen a solid reduction in net financial debt and have always posted a solid roic      total assets      net financial debt      roic      concha y toro has also been able to steadily increase production since its  acquisition of the californian fetzer vineyards in a business that is so dependent on optimal weather conditions and exchange rate variations this is impressive and a testament to management’s ability to work with its producers to achieve steady production thousands of boxes liters      chile domestic and international      argentina domestic and international      united states domestic and international      another of the key strengths of concha y toro is its globally diversified portfolio the company distributes its award winning wines around the world enabling it to take advantage of growing markets in asia europe canada the us and africa in q   of concha y toro’s total sales were from its exportation business made in word data from q  report the historic strength of viña concha y toro has always been backed by a consistent demand for their product millennials are continuing the trend of wine obsession and even increasing consumption relative to past generations michael mondavi one of the most wellknown names in the industry who founded the folio fine wine partners and michael mondavi family estate in an interview with business insider the average age of the consumer has dropped and the millennials and gen xers are the exciting part of the wine business the millennials were the first generation where men and women preferred wine or beer over spirits the millennial generation was the first where women drank as much wine as men the chilean wine scene is also becoming increasingly accepted and wellthought of worldwide this is partly due to new perceptions among younger consumers about wines from chile and south america in general in the past south american wines have been known mainly as inexpensive alternatives but of late an increasing number of brands are receiving quality marks from enthusiasts and critics for example the renowned wine critic james suckling recently toured chilean vineyards and gave rave reviews of their products in fact on his trip  of the wines he tasted were given ratings of  points or higher james suckling there’s never been a better time to buy chilean wine the qualityprice ratio is also hard to ignore highly rated chilean bottles that cost  to  a bottle in the united states can easily compete with european or californian counterparts that would cost three to four times as much sharp headwinds in q  in mm  q  q  ebitda   operating income   total cost of sales   total sales   total volume in liters   the cost of sales rose by  in q due to increased wine costs which were caused by adverse weather conditions during the  harvest both argentina and chile faced severe rains in  due to the impact of “el niño” causing some serious headaches for wine producers in the region according to eduardo chadwick president of viña errazuriz  seña this drop in production will affect the supply of chilean entry level wines and will speed up the premiumization process of our industry for export we should also see an increase in the price for top chilean wines for concha y toro whose sales mostly come from commodity level wine chadwick was correct and the effects on wine production and sales numbers in q  were evident however we have also seen the average price of wine sold by concha y toro rise domestically in chile for example the company saw a  rise in average price and their premium sales grew by  while their nonpremium sales decreased by  in argentina the average price per liter domestically went up a whopping  the area which has been hampered by bad weather conditions looks to be a growth opportunity going forward unfortunately  has seen yet another year of adverse weather conditions for the company especially in chile according to the annual wine production report of the servicio agricola y ganadero of chile production fell in  by  this was due to abnormally hot and dry conditions which brought the harvest forward by anywhere from two weeks to a month in the wine producing regions of chile this of course will increase the cost of sales for concha y toro going forward there is a silver lining though when i spoke to blanca bustamante at investor relations for the company she said that the harvest would be of very high quality this year and that the much talked about fires in the region did not impact concha y toro this higher quality crop will increase the average price per liter domestically yet againand abroad as well a continuing trend for the company although exportation prices have been affected by exchange rate variations this is only a temporary issue and could lead to a price drop in the stock which would present a buying opportunity exchange rate variation is one of the largest issues concha y toro faced in q  this is exemplified by the fact that the company’s total wine sales fell by  in q  vs q  but when you ignore exchange rate variations wine sales actually went up by  like they said in the introduction to the q  report en el primer trimestre de  concha y toro enfrentó un escenario externo desafiante marcado por depreciación de monedas claves para las exportaciones frente al peso chileno my translation is as follows in q  concha y toro faced a challenging international scenario marked by depreciation of key currencies for exportation versus the chilean peso the depreciation of the euro and gbp was particularly harmful to the company’s bottom line unforeseen issues like brexit had a serious impact on concha y toro this quarter when i asked ms bustamante about this she said that although it is difficult to determine the future of the chilean peso and other currencies the exchange rate variation issues should lessen going forward the other area of concern for concha y toro was in the other income sector of the business the termination of a distribution deal with monster led to a  decrease in revenues in the segment they also faced pressure in their distribution of water  diageo products  and pisco  there were however some positives in q as always with concha y toro mainly their continued commitment to reducing their debt ratio and increasing dividends the decrease in debt is impressive given the trials faced by the company in  and q  q  q  dividend yield   debt ratio   conclusion all of these stark headwinds faced by concha y toro have led to investors being wary of the company source bloomberg i can see why as they have faced exceedingly difficult challenges in their exportation business due to exchange rate variation as well as pressure on their production and costs due to poor weather that being said all of these issues are temporary and haven’t changed what makes concha y toro one of the best and most well respected wine producers in the world they still have excellent diversification in exportation production and distribution quality management everincreasing assets in quality locations a state of the art center for research and innovation and a rapidly growing market i will be keeping my eye on concha y toro and waiting for my entry point in an overpriced us equity market it is wise to find value internationally and although concha y toro may not be ready just yet given time they will be ripe for the picking disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks

have already joined gurufocus to track the stocks they follow and exchange investment ideas concha y toro winery inc nysevco gross property plant and equipment gurufvcogross property plant and equipment  mil as of mar  concha y toro winery incs quarterly gross ppe increased from sep   mil to dec   mil but then declined from dec   mil to mar   mil concha y toro winery incs annual gross ppe declined from dec   mil to dec   mil but then increased from dec   mil to dec   mil definition property plant and equipment ppe are the fixed assets of the company fixed assets are also known as noncurrent assets property plant and equipment includes assets that will  in the normal course of business  neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers some of the most common parts of property plant and equipment are  land  buildings and leasehold improvements  transportation equipment  manufacturing equipment  office equipment  office furniture companies with lots of property plant and equipment often have special categories for example railroad property includes  track  ties  ballast  bridges  tunnels  signals  locomotives  freight cars there is often a note in the financial statements  found in a companys k  that will explain the different categories of property a company owns the market value of property plant and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property plant and equipment for example when berkshire hathaway liquidated its textile mills it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away that property plant and equipment was literally worth less than zero on the other hand some companies own thousands of acres of land all property plant and equipment other than land is depreciated land is never depreciated however land is not marked up to market value either under generally accepted accounting principles gaap land is shown on the balance sheet at cost the property plant and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property plant and equipment this means it is the cost of the property plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation explanation a company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive the company replaces when it wears out on the other hand a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits there is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures think coca cola johnson  johnson etc related terms total assets accumulated depreciation property plant and equipment historical data  all numbers
