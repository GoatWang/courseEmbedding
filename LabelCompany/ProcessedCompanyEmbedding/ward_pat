podcast interviews i had the pleasure of being invited onto two great podcasts in the past few weeks and both just got published today historic performance podcast the first podcast was with james darley on his historic performance podcast this podcast we talked a lot about the process of developing a high performance team – a team that brings together medical strength and conditioning and sport sciencedata science departments additionally we discuss a blog post i wrote about the nba draft and some ideas around drafting players click here to listen fit info club podcast the next podcast was with guy bortz on his fit info club podcast in this podcast we talked in depth on the processes of sport science within a team environment and the importance of using data wisely we also cover a lot of the concepts i discussed in my recent  nsca national conference presentation click here to listen concurrent training – the effect of intensity distribution periodization and planning of training is a topic that fascinates me as i enjoy studying how good coaches structure training and develop athletes lots of thoughts exist regarding the best periodization strategy to use eg linear block conjugate vertical integration undulating daily undulating fluid etc concurrent training is one approach to structuring a training program where multiple qualities are trained within the same session of course this may present problems where one quality eg strength may interfere with another quality eg aerobic training that you are looking to also develop in that session for more on this issue referred to as the interference phenomenon see this blog post i wrote about  years ago a new study by varelasanz and colleagues evaluated the effect of concurrent training between two programs that had equivalent external loads volume x intensity but differed in training intensity distribution this evaluation may provide practitioners with a better understanding of the optimal dose and intensity needed to minimize the interference phenomenon in team sport athletes this may be essential as training and developing multiple qualities needed for sport is crucial and the shortened offseason periods can make program planning a challenge study overview subjects  sport science students  men   women duration  weeks independent variable external training load dependent variables counter movement jump bench press  –  rm was performed and used to estimate  rm half squat  –  rm was performed and used to estimate  rm max aerobic speed université de montréal track test body composition body weight  skinfold measurements hrv rpe feeling scale training impulse trimp training groups traditional training group n   this group followed the exercise guidelines recommended by the american college of sports medicine acsm which suggests that moderatetovigorous intensity aerobic exercise is performed on most days of the week polarized training group n  this group followed a polarized training program polarized training programs have been recommended for endurance athletes as a method of distributing training intensity despite this polarized approach external load was matched to the traditional training group control group n   training program training frequency xweek mon wed fri monday  friday sessions were min wednesday’s session was min training set up mondayfriday training cardiovascular training resistance training wednesday training cardiovascular training results no differences for total workload rpe trimp or feeling score were found between groups over the week period the traditional training group was the only group to see a decrease in resting hr both supine and standing following the training program no changes in hrv were seen for any group both training groups saw improvements in rm for the bench press half squat and max aerobic speed the polarized group saw an increase in body weight without a change in body fat following the week training program and was still able to maintain their vertical jump abilities practical applications i don’t know that this study moves us any closer to understanding the optimal distribution of training intensity when performing a concurrent training program the polarized group performed easier cardiovascular training on days where they performed resistance training monday  friday and on wednesday’s they performed easy cardiovascular training followed by high intensity interval training the traditional group performed the same training session each day with the same intensities for the duration of the week program despite the differences in intensity distribution both groups appeared to make improvements so it is really difficult to tell which method may be more beneficial or perhaps they are really just the same there are a number of things to consider when reading this study the subjects are not highlevel athletes and it is possible that any form of training is going to provide a positive training effect resistance training volume was low they only used two exercises – bench press and half squat so we don’t know what would happen if there were more resistance training in the program the polar training group trained opposite qualities during their training sessions which is interesting given that a commonly held belief amongst coaches is to try and group similar qualities together in one session rather than mix them ie sprinting  heavy strength training or aerobic training  lower intensity resistance training probably the most important thing that i think about with papers like this is that we need to begin to dig down into understanding individual differences comparing group means doesn’t really tell us how the individual’s responded and then allow us to make better inference to our own athletes about what sort of outcome we might expect to get when we write a training program training is a very individualized process and how someone responds to the program we apply to them is dependent on a number of factors – some that we might be able to measure and quantify and others which we might not be able to measure and quantify and a few others that we might not even be aware of yet in the process of evaluating individual differences we may find that some athletes in each group got better a few stayed the same and some may have gotten worse without understanding these individual differences and then attempting to unpack the deeper question of “why” it will be hard to plan individualized training programs in the future if we can get to the bottom of how people respond to training and we can start to go down the road of figuring out the factors that influence that response we will start to have a better idea of the impact our training program will have for that athlete allowing us to make individual adjustments that may lead to more favorable outcomes     functional range release  developing your own system this weekend i had the pleasure of once again learning from dr andreo spina at the functional range conditioning course the course was assisted by dewey nielsen and hunter cook for those who have never taken one of dr spina’s courses they are a great blend of science and applied work this course was entirely focused on movement and developing joint range of motion and control throughout the variety of activities that an individual may encounter depending on whatever it is they are trying to do play sport workout live life etc instead of just reviewing the course i figured i’d blend in some of my ideas of how i go about trying to take new things i learn and putting them into my own system a lot of times when people take a course they immediately gravitate towards some of the ideas but then show up to work on monday and fall into what they’ve always done they borrow a few exercises or “drills” that they were taught over the weekend however they never really operationalize what they have learned in order to see how it truly integrates into their own system in fact some people have never even sat down to write out their own system in the first place for interested readers i wrote an entire article about developing your own system a little over a year ago click here functional range conditioning first functional range conditioning frc is not “mobility drills” that you just add to your warm up pnf fancy gymnastic type exercises frc is not “mobility drills” that you just add to your warm up for min the goal of the system is to identify joints that have limited function and work to improve them before loading them a lot of people end up attending courses like frc and walk away thinking “oh this will be a good hip stretch to give to my clients and this drill will be a good tspine mobility exercise to prescribe to my patients” chance are if you are thinking like this you are missing the point the system is set up to help you identify limitations and plan a training program that is specific to the needs of the client while some of the exercises in frc utilize isometrics or eccentrics and may resemble pnf frc is not pnf dr spina discusses the scientific literature extensively and is adamant about the fact that he did not invent any of this stuff rather we are listening to his interpretation of what the science says and how he has taken that science and created his own approach to movement and exercise thus if you say that some of this looks like pnf he would say “sure of course it does but what we are doing goes beyond what pnf is because the other components of my system come from other realms of science” fancy gymnastic exercises are currently all the rage on social media and while there are those who do frc that can do some incredibly crazy movements the goal of the system is not to get you to be a gymnast rather the goal of the system is to conduct a needs analysis of your client determine the prerequisite movement competencies they require for their tasksport and then test them to ensure they poses these prerequisite competencies if they do not have these competencies then you at least know where to begin your training program a good example would be a strength coach who wants their athletes to squat yet several of the athletes lack prerequisites of ankle dorsiflexion healthy kneetibial rotation or hip internal rotation the strength coach puts these athletes under load and then may wonder why the athletes report back hip or knee pain  weeks later or it could be shoulder or neck pain or maybe elbow pain or…well it could be whatever the point is that if you lack prerequisite competencies to meet your movement demands then load will be taken up somewhere in the body and wherever load begins to exceed capacity we end up with an injury the aim isn’t to turn everyone into gumby a football player probably doesn’t need to be able to do the full splits or do any sort of crazy movement exercise but they do need health joint rom and then control and strength through that rom to satisfy their needs and demands on the field in order to mitigate the risk of injury what functional range conditioning frc is functional range conditioning is a movement based system that applies scientific approaches to developing or redeveloping joint mobility joint integrity strength and connective tissue resilience these goals are met through a progressive system consisting of controlled articular rotations cars progressive angular isometric loadings pails and regressive angular isometric loadings rails progressive angular loadings pals and regressive angular loadings rals full range control cars can serve as both a warm eg a daily routine as well as an assessment of each joint when a limitation is found pails and rails are the initial starting point to help the individual redevelop normal joint function note don’t expect this to happen overnight when an improvement has been made in joint function the soft tissue structures can begin to be loaded in order to develop end range control and strength finally progressing to full range control this approach is useful for both rehabilitation and strength and conditioning the concepts are simple assess joint ranges of motion and if the client lacks specific ranges of motion then work to improve those limitations through targeted strategies i highlight targeted strategies because this is a critical component to the frc system don’t just do “stuff” rather assess for limitations and program targeted interventions that are specific to the individual’s needs these targeted interventions should lead to a desired outcomeimprovement and this should be tested to ensure that improvements are being made progress these interventions to train the individual with lots of variability through a wide range of motion as dr spina says “you always end up regretting the position or range of motion you didn’t train in” why because the second you are thrust into that range of motion during a game or at some point in life and your tissue doesn’t have the capacity to control that range of motion you end up getting injured “but how am i supposed to get my other liftingtraining in” during the course someone asked dr spina “so where would i fit this in with my normal training” to which dr spina replied “you have a hip and an ankle with extremely limited mobility yet you want to squat in your training program and you are worried about where to fit frc in i’d look back at you and ask “where the heck are you going to fit your squat training into your frc training training because it seems like this is what you need to do first” the reply is brilliant and addresses the first point above about what frc is not frc is not just about learning mobility exercises if you want to use frc and be effective in rehabilitation or training you need to think about programming this stuff just like you would any other exercise does this mean that if you lack joint mobility in some of your prerequisites that you can no longer train until it improves absolutely not if you find areas of limitation program exercises for those limitations into your training as you would any other exercise ie squats bench press sprints plyos etc and work diligently on them while you also work on your other exercises to address your strength and power doing this might require a lateralization or regression of some exercises or a decrease in training volume or intensity temporarily this tends to scare people as if the idea of decreasing lifting volume means they will automatically lose all strength and turn to mush but if you work on improving your limitations you may find that as these prerequisites improve your strength begins to increase at a faster rate i’ve discussed the concept of lateralizations and regressions a concept discussed extensively by charlie weingroff in a previous blog article the concept basically tells us that we can still load and train while working on improving our limitation by choosing exercises that that don’t load us into that limitation for example if the football player lacks proper ankle dorsiflexion while they are working on improving this limitation you would lateralize their squat to something that does not require them to load into ankle dorsiflexion such as a split squat rear foot elevated split squat with a veritical tibia trap bar deadlift deadlift rack pull etc how do i fit this into my own system my training philosophy consists of three main elements movement stress resistancestress tolerance fitness within each of these buckets we have methods of testing and methods of training what we test and how we train depends on the individual and the sport they are preparing for – this is not a one size fits all the goal of the system is to increase the athletes physiological buffer zone to make them as robust as possible against the stressors they will face in competition across a season obviously the frc system fits into the movement bucket – does the athlete posses the necessary joint ranges of motion to satisfy the needs and demands of their sport or even the specific position they play within that sport fitting the concepts of the frc system into my own training methodology is not hard and actually compliments a lot of things i already do which makes sense given that i’ve known dr spina for a few years and his approaches along with those of charlie weingroff have been very influential on me within that movement bucket here are some of the ways i’d take these concepts and begin to apply them deep offseason conditioning should be aimed at developing prerequisite competencies specific to the sport or addressing limitations that the athlete has strength training volume is lower during this time of year we may only perform  daysweek of  exercises with intensities of  so it would not impeded on any of the frc approaches we are taking to redevelop joint movement note the exercises and the intensity of the exercises in the frc system are absolutely brutal and exhausting because they are very specific and they target things that you are currently very poor at cars would be used as a daily routine to help move the joints through their available ranges of motion and exercises targeted at specific limitations start by selecting just  limitations will follow cars exercises each day two to three times per week the individual will do a longer session of full body frc what is referred to as a kinstretch session aside form the strength training discussed above we would have some form of energy system training focused on developing general fitness and not highly specific to their sport at this time eg aerobic adaptations lower intensity conditioning activities etc as you begin to transition into more specific work and get closer to the season use the kinstretch sessions xweek to keep improving joint control cars will always be part of the daily routine this may only take about min and any limitations are noted hopefully at this point the athlete has acquired the important prerequisite competencies from the previous phase lifting plyometrics and sprinting need to begin to take a front seat in the training program in order to prepare for the competitive season if the athlete is still lacking sport specific or exercise specific perquisite competencies lateralize or regress their strength and power exercises in order to develop those qualities while still working to improve joint integrity and soft tissue resilience in the areas of the limitations during the season the min daily cars continue i see this being essential inseason inseason the wear and tear of competition and repetitive loading of tissues can become problematic for athletes and often lead to losses of joint range of motion or painful regions of joint movement painful arcs or closing angle pain the inseason daily cars session serves to keep the joints healthy and maintain ranges of motion allows the athlete to stay on top of any losses of range of motion or limitations as well as inform the medical staff about any of these losses of range of motion or painful movements to proactively receive treatment and not wait until something breaks the kinstretch session may continue xweek to help maintain whole body movements during the inseason period the frc system is highly useful and one of the things i appreciate about it is that dr spina does not teach you exercises he teaches you concepts you as the coach or therapist need to determine which exercises your athletes need you need to determine which prerequisite competencies are required for your sport you need to plan the approach and develop the program and even develop your own exercises that target the individual’s needs rather than teaching you “stuff” dr spina teaches you how he thinks if you have your own system if you’ve taken the time to sit down and write out what things are important to you and how you test and trainaddress those things within that system then it makes it a lot easier for you to operationalize concepts from someone elses system should you feel that those concepts compliment what you do and are important to you as well frc is not about exercises it is about a thought process the concepts taught in the course are extremely valuable and useful whether you train elite athletes high school athletes or general population clients of any age or ability because frc is a thought process you can adapt the concepts to any client as you the coachtherapist develop the exercises and interventions don’t just do stuff train with a purpose    nba draft – how do you put together a winning team the  nba playoffs have just begun meaning  fortunate teams are still playing ball while  others are preparing for the  draft and beginning to set up the structure of their team for next season “there’s always next season” the concept of drafting players is an interesting one so much goes into it – athleticism physical stature game smarts college performance and the player’s mentality ie will they be able to handle the pressure will they fit in with the guys and have good team chemistry etc recently motomura and colleagues  discussed the role the draft can playing in building an nba franchise more importantly they set out to understand whether having more or higher draft picks actually made an nba team better they concluded “we find that the draft is not necessarily the best road to success an excellent organization and general manager better enable teams to succeed even without high draft picks” this got me thinking – could we potentially try and understand which teams are “excellent” organizations in terms of selecting players that enjoy success at in the nba additionally i am really interested in the philadelphia ers year after year they always seem to be in the conversation of tanking at the end of the season in order to increase their chances of obtaining higher round draft picks in the nba draft lottery in fact they have been so good at this over the past few seasons that the  season is supposed to the final season of the tanking era in philadelphia unfortunately their efforts to tank and stock pile great players has not payed off they seem to have a hard time either selecting good players if you are going to tank you better not miss on your draft picks developing players or bringing in veteran players who can surround the young stars so that they don’t have to play a high number of minutes their rookie season and carry the team something also addressed in the motomura above the data  –  nba draft data was obtained from basketballreferencecom aims with  picks in the nba draft  total over the  year period how many players on average do teams pick up what is the average value of players selected in each of the draft number spots which teams have been most successful at picking players that added a high amount of value to their team what is going on in philly number of draft picks over the  –  nba draft  total players have been chosen with teams averaging  players drafted during that period the ers certainly are leading the way selecting  players over this  year stretch note you will notice there are  teams in the table below this is because i left in expansion teams and teams that moved from one city to another during this  year period i did this to just represent what took place in the draft between  –  what is the value of a draft pick value or success metrics are often one of the more difficult things to pin down when studying team sport athletes lots of things players do can add value to a team without ever making it into the box score which primarily consists of count metrics the writers at basketballreferencescom display two metrics which i used to quantify a player’s value – win shares and value over replacement player both of these metrics are the type of metrics that were born out of baseball’s sabermetrics as a way of trying to provide more context to the box score metrics presented to fans everyday on websites or in newspapers win shares is a metric that takes the teams success and divides up credit for that success among the participating players value over a replacement player is a metric which projects the player’s value versus a fictitious replacement player both of these metrics have limitations and people argue frequently over which is more useful or whether we should use a different metric to represent value eg player efficiency rating or something like  or adjusted  both of which have their own limitations i simply chose these metrics because they were readily available and they would provide me with a quick way to represent player value any metric one deems important would suffice though to reflect value per pick i summarized the data in a few ways i binned the picks into groups of ten picks      and  because i was dealing with a five year period it meant that there would only be  picks for each selection  which wouldn’t provide enough data thus binning it this way helped me group more players together since i am using  years of data it isn’t really fair to look at something like win shares for all of the players since players who were drafted in  have a much longer time to contribute to their win share compared to a player drafted in  a rookie thus i reflected win shares over games played to attempt to look at each player’s contribution to their teams success relative to the amount of games they participated in finally i added in minutes per game simply because i wanted to see what the participation differences were between the bins of draft picks the data in the below table is the average of each metric for the six different draft pick bins as we would expect or should expect there is a monotonic decrease in each of the three metrics as we move from pick  to pick  this is to be expected and tells us that the quality of player begins to decrease as we move down the draft board better players are being selected higher up the only place this doesn’t seem to happen is in pick  for the average value over replacement player i’m not really certain why this is it could be that during this five year stretch there were a lot of players selected from those picks that had minimal to no contribution to their team draft pick value per team first we look at the sum of win shares per game for each draft pick bin i added up the win shares per game for each player the team selected in each of the draft pick bins and then summed those up to obtain a  year “value add” i then standardized the scores in order to see how each team did relative to the average value add during this  year stretch note there is a limitation with this analysis in that i didn’t have a way of going through each player to see if they played for their draft team over the entire  year period it is entirely possible that some players moved on or maybe got drafted and immediately traded and never had a chance to play with their draft team as we will see when we discuss philadelphia that being said what quickly jumps out is that  teams appear to be very good at identifying those who will be valuable nba players whether they still play on their draft team or not – houston cleveland detroit denver minnesota and utah it is important to keep in mind however that some of these scores might be coming from one or two players during this five year period for example guys like karlanthony towns minnesota and kyrie irving cleveland make significant contributions to their teams in terms of value add both players were also  draft picks another interesting observation is the value houston cleveland and detroit were able to find in picks  those three teams stand alone in that draft pick bin as all of the other teams seem to lack the ability to find valuable players houston looks to be pretty incredible at identifying talented players as they are green in several of the draft bins and have had the most success in drafting using wins shares as the metric of success compared to other teams over this period houston also happens to be a team that is praised for their analytic savviness and perhaps this helps contribute to their ability to scout talent in looking at this chart philadelphia doesn’t appear to be doing too bad th ranked team however it is important to keep in mind the limitation of this chart in that some players might be adding value for teams other than the team which drafted them i do give philly credit for identifying some of the players as potentially successful players but trading them away doesn’t help this will be discussed later in the article  next we turn our attention to the value over replacement metric for this analysis i took the average value over replacement for each of the draft pick bins for each team i then took the average of every draft pick bin for each team and created a  year average value over replacement player this metric was then standardized for all teams to investigate how they did relative to the rest of the league   now we get a little bit of a different look at the league and how successful teams draft players as in the above analysis there is a similar limitation in that players may have moved on from the team that drafted them however the main goal is to understand who is good at identifying talent we still see houston in the top  not only are they selecting players that are adding win value but these players are also contributing more than the replacement player would golden state who was in the top  on the previous chart looks to steal the show here with players above the replacement level player philadelphia takes a bit of a hit in this chart so what is going on in philly this is a tough one to sort out as i alluded to above sometimes teams draft players and then move those players on to other teams philly has been accused of tanking in order to get better draft picks and if you are going to try and go out of your way to get better draft picks then you need to ensure those draft picks actually turn into great players otherwise you just end up being in the same position next year philly drafted  players over the past  years – well above the norm for an nba team during this time of the  players drafted only  of those players actually ended up playing for the team in some capacity of those  players only  of them remain with the team of those  players one is joel embiid who has not played a game in his first  seasons with the team due to injury embiid was the rd round pick in the  draft and has proven thus far to be a very costly selection for the franchise here is an overview of the  players philly has selected in the past  years players in red are players that are no longer in the nba or never even made it into an nba game that is  out of philadelphia’s  picks  who either don’t play in the nba anymore or never made it in the first place stockpiling picks in the hope that a few of them turn into something valuable might not be a horrible idea but when almost  of the players have washed out of the league it may be hard to justify this strategy moreover  of the players drafted no longer play on the team this is including the former rookie of the year michael carterwilliams and maurice harkless  win shares and a value above replacement player of  who was traded for andrew bynum who turned out to be an nba bust with only   out of  of the drafted players still on the team counting embiid who has made no contribution at all due to injury it appears to have been a pretty unsuccessful  years of drafting the team was  this season and didn’t show much improvement over years past perhaps the tanking era isn’t over yet in philly conclusion drafting players is really difficult there are a lot of things that go into it and some may say it is a lot of luck that being said there are some teams that seem to come out on top or near the top yearafteryear you can have those big luck years where you snag a lot of great talent and hit a home run but i think more importantly you just need to be consistent the big luck years are good but the years where you are consistently bad end up setting you back as discussed in the motomura paper having a well run organization that understands how to not only develop talent but also bring in veteran players to surround the younger players and take some of the pressure off might be the most important thing too often i think teams try and tank with the idea that their first round pick is going to save the franchise next season instead they should consider the things they need to do to help that first round pick develop into the player they need him to be down the road in order to save the franchise references motomura a roberts kv leeds dm leeds ma does it pay to build through the draft in the national basketball association j sports economics     daily undulating periodization  performance improvements in powerlifters dr mike zourdos and colleagues just published a new paper on daily undulating periodization zourdos mc et al modified daily undulating periodization model produces greater performance than a traditional configuration in powerlifters j strength cond res  published ahead of print being a fan of the daily undulating periodization approach to training structure i thought i would summarize the paper and share some of my thoughts subjects  male collegeaged powerlifters subjects were assigned to one of two groups hypertrophy strength  power hsp or hypertrophy power  strength hps the groups were balanced to ensure that relative and absolute strength were similar training programs hypertrophy strength  power this group performed three sessions per week on nonconsecutive days day  had a primary emphasis of hypertrophy day  had an emphasis of strength and day  had an emphasis of power hypertrophy power  strength this group performed three sessions per week on nonconsecutive days day  had a primary emphasis of hypertrophy day  had an emphasis of power and day  had an emphasis of strength the rationale for testing the outcome between these two weekly training schemes is that in the former which is a common weekly set up for daily undulating periodization in research the strength session takes place  hours following the hypertrophy session which is the higher volume training session of the three this may create an issue with the subject’s ability to perform their strength session due to the lack of recovery from the high volume hypertrophy session the variables for each of the training days are described in the chart below on hypertrophy and power days the subjects performed the squat and bench press exercises on strength days the subjects performed squat bench press and deadlifts the load used for hypertrophy days in weeks  where autoregulated using the methods proposed by mann et al mann jb et al the effect of autoregularatory progressive resistance exercise vs linear periodization on strength improvement in college athletes j strength cond res    summary of strength results the strength change results from both of the week training programs are summarized as follows no statistical difference in the squat and deadlift were found between groups however a statistical improvement was seen in the bench press for the hps group compared to the hsp group no statistical difference was found between groups for powerlifting total effect sizes greater than  were noted for the squat bench press and powerlifting total in favor of hps which may suggest a practically significant improvement in hps versus hsp when developing training programs for powerlifters comments  thought this was an interesting study and i like the approach of trying to find an optimal scheme within the training week perhaps someday we may find that the optimal scheme for the daily undulating periodization model or any training model is one where the emphasis of training on a given day is dictated based on how the athlete reports and what they are able to tolerate this very fluid approach to programming – where we are attempting to strike a balance between training variety to prevent monotony and a concentrated dose of training to increase fitness in a certain capacity – has been suggested by john kiely’s work on periodization in the paper by zourdos and colleagues they used an autoregulation approach on the hypertrophy day to dictate the training loadintensity for that session an approach discussed by mel siff in supertraining and researched by bryan mann as referenced above perhaps in a practical setting we could extend this a bit further and utilize a linear position transducer or some other form of velocity based approach the folks at push have come up with an affordable and easy to use solution to dictate the loadintensity on the power and strength training days if the athlete is sluggish and moving the bar slowly then lower the load to stay within a desired range of bar velocity additionally because training takes place on nonconsecutive days in this type of frame work eg  sessions over  days it may be possible to utilize monitoring strategies bar velocity daily wellness rpe training loads hrv etc to make the suggestion that the athlete take a rest day instead of performing the scheduled training session and see how their body is the following day and if it is prepared to tolerate the load the use of effect sizes in this paper allows us to get a better understanding of whether or not the average difference between groups is of practical significance one of the things that i find  critical when looking at research on training interventions is the understanding of interindividual differences it is very possible that some athletes in this study responded favorably to either of the training approaches while others had no result or a poor result  the paper also look at things like changes in total volume and some hormonal measures when it comes to understanding responders and nonresponders in training it isn’t good enough to just say “some people get better and others don’t” at some point we need to figure out who doesn’t respond and why they don’t respond perhaps there is something to additionally look at in this paper with the hormonal changes and the individual’s ability to increase training volume or get stagnant during certain periods of the training program hopefully this group continues to do more research on the topic of daily undulating periodization because i find it to be a practical method of programming training and they have done some good work thus far that they can certainly follow up on while mike zourdos tends to aim his approach at powerlifters i believe because he is competitive lifter himself there are concepts within this framework that can easily be extended to training team
