management and research firm our analysis and research of the markets complement our portfolio management efforts we are unique in that we do not analyze the economy have little interest in corporate developments and fundamentals and have little use for traditional technical quantitative or other market indicators our approach is to understand the psychology and history of the market and most importantly the actions of investors much of our effort involves money flows or what has traditionally been called ticker tape analysis we follow the ideology of charles dow in our methods as he stated years ago start with the markets input the market reflects all that the jobber knows about the condition of the textile trade all that the banker knows about the money market all that the bestinformed president knows of his own business together with his knowledge of all other businesses it sees the general condition of transportation in a way that the president of no single railroad can ever see it is better informed on crops than the farmer or even the department of agriculture in fact the market reduces to a bloodless verdict all knowledge bearing on finance both domestic and foreign the price movements therefore represent everything everybody knows hopes believes and anticipates hence there is no need to supplement the price movements as some statisticians do with elaborate compilations of commodity price index numbers bank clearings fluctuations in exchange or anything else the price movements themselves reflect all these things and therefore an understanding of the price movements of the market charles dow the firm has three main areas of focus us equity research global equity research and money management us equity research laszlo birinyi began analyzing
