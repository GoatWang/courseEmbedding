training and also acts as director of the first global gender violence prevention program in the us marine corps katz and his colleagues have also conducted trainings for the us army in iraq and mvp has been piloted around the world by the us navy key ideasedit bystander approachedit katz advocates the bystander approach to gender violence and bullying prevention instead of focusing on women as victims and men as perpetrators of harassment abuse or violence the bystander approach concentrates on the role of peers in schools groups teams workplaces and other social units in  after an alleged gang rape in richmond california where two dozen teenagers watched and did nothing newsweek online reported that a small but growing group of educators is trying to bring whats called bystander education to american schools while sexual violence prevention programs have typically focused on the victim discouraging women from walking alone at night for example or the perpetrator reiterating the fact that no means no the bystander approach emphasizes the role witnesses can play in either supporting or challenging violence katz and his colleagues developed one of the first bystander initiatives the mixedgender mentors in violence prevention mvp program in  at northeastern university’s center for the study of sport in society “most people think they only have two choices for intervention” says katz “one is to intervene physically right at the point of attack and the other is to do nothing and that’s a false set of choices” as part of the mvp program students sit in a classroom and talk about the menu of options—from getting a group of friends together to calling —available to them at the heart of the program is a set of scenarios that allow students to imagine what they might do in a variety of situations each scenario comes with a list of viable interventions for bystanders according to newsweek research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of bystanderawareness programs in schools but the initial results are promising one study found that after the sioux city school district in iowa implemented the mvp program the number of freshman boys who said they could help prevent violence against women and girls increased by  percent the bystander programs that have proliferated in recent years on college and high school campuses and in the us military involve both sexes and draw from various violence prevention theories and educational practices the mvp model was influenced by basic tenets of social justice education this approach is partly based on the premise that men’s silence in the face of other men’s abusive or violent behavior gives implicit consent to such behavior the mvp bystander approach frames men’s abuse of women as a societal problem whose roots lie in the institutional structures and cultural practices of a maledominated society  thus the mvp approach emphasizes changing social norms as the key to prevention by challenging men to speak up and “change group dynamics in male peer culture”this bystander model empowers men to step outside of the victimperpetrator binary and gives men an opportunity to talk about some of the “dynamics of their interpersonal and group interaction in a safe space” mentors in violence prevention mvp modeledit jackson katz presented the mentors in violence prevention mvp model hoping to put the focus on men to discontinue trends of violent masculinity through creating a model that would invite men into the critical dialogue instead of painting them as perpetrators or potential perpetrators katz realized that there was a frustrating lack of inclusion of men and boys in the gender violence discussion prompting him to create an education model that was inclusive to men and boys the original mvp model was created as workshops for allmale student athletes katz hoped that by working with male student athletes they could help to stop the spread of ‘rapesupportive’ and ‘batteringsupportive’ attitudes by speaking out against the masculine binary that supports gender violence recon  katz says his initial focus on working with studentathletes stems from the “apathy defensiveness—and sometimes outright hostility—of male athletic directors coaches and studentathletesmen and young men in the…athletic subculture…typically occupy a privileged position in school culture and particularly in male peer culture”  this is a step towards the bystander approach by working with boys who typically represented the popular part of school culture katz was hoping that these boys would then influence the people around them and in their schools in similar manners it was important for katz to ensure that mvp considers male studentathletes as potential mentors for younger kids able of providing male leadership necessary to stop gender abuse katz’s model generally revolves around simulation and roleplaying as well as large discussionbased group meetings both consisting samesex and differentsex students as a part of his college initiative his mvp model involves “holding three minute sessions each year with each participating college team a fourth session is scheduled for those studentathletes who wish to be trained further for work with younger students in middle and high school”  these workshops are designed to provide spaces for boys to discuss with each other the concept of masculinity and its definition as well as its relation to gender abuse and violence additionally katz recognizes the role of those in positions of authority in schools and athletic teams as his program has grown and evolved he has included training of selected male and professional staff working in all sectors of schools and colleges in this he is hoping that the topdown approach will provide role models for young and impressionable students and athletes who are looking for good representation if these school leaders are able to use their positions of authority as positions of good influence it will perhaps encourage a change in paradigm that will affect all of those in the school or community the mvp model originally focused on just male studentathletes since the mvp model has expanded its target audience and educational group to “boys and girls men and women working together and in singlesex formats…by the mid’s mvp had moved from a nearexclusive focus on the athletic world to general populations of high school and college students and other institutional settings”  this expansion means that the dialogue around gender abuse and gender binaries is spreading throughout schools across the nation more frank and honest talk about gender abuse will not only remove many of the stigmas from those who are abused but will also encourage students to act out and speak out in defense of themselves and each other media literacy and masculinitiesedit in his writings public lectures and films katz argues that gendered understandings and behavior in every arena from interpersonal relationships to the workplace and even politics are influenced by media and popular culture focusing on normative portrayals of men in advertising television hollywood films the entertainment industries sports and politics katz calls for an examination of the poses we strike and the images of masculinity that proliferate in media culture as a way to illuminate whats going on in individual mens lives and in our culture as a whole katz further maintains that in spite of variability due to such categories as class race and ethnicity violence in america is overwhelmingly a gendered phenomenon shaped by cultural codes and ideals of masculinity and manhood he argues that masculinity and femininity are socially constructed categories and thus the disturbing equation of masculinity with pathological control and violence that currently exists in america is not genetically predetermined and can be changed in the tough guise study guide cowritten with the video producer jeremy earp of the media education foundation katz underscores his motivation for promoting media literacy by looking critically at how institutions – from media outlets to political institutions to our schools – often play a role in reinforcing constricted regressive notions of manhood that maintain an unacceptably violent status quo we might begin to clear some space for individuals male and female to live freer lives presidential masculinitiesedit katzs work on images of masculinity in media extends to his examination of a crucial but barely explored topic of cultural studies analysis the role of media culture in the construction of presidential masculinity katz posits that media have become the single most important source of political information and persuasion and that education for democracy in this era requires citizens to be media literate according to katz part of being politically media literate means understanding how gender functions as a subtextual force in presidential politics he asks questions such as how does the perceived manliness or toughness of political candidates affect their electoral success to what degree is the gender gap in presidential politics affected by mens gendered identities and sense of themselves as men which itself is reinforced by media discourses and portrayals how does paid political advertising on television – by far the biggest expenditure of funds in presidential campaigns – shape voters perceptions of the relative manliness of candidates what are the similarities and differences between how women and men ascertain whether male political figures measure up to the masculine ideal that is circulating in media culture at a given historical moment which mediated white masculine styles or archetypes have been politically successful over the past fifty years and why in an article about the barack obamahillary clinton race for the democratic presidential nomination in  katz responded to pundits and other political observers who decried the media focus on race and gender when other crucial issues loomed presidential elections are always about race and gender the reason people are talking about them now is that a black man and a white woman are serious contenders for a major party nomination their success is making visible what historically has been hidden in plain sight campaigns for the us presidency in the era of mass media he wrote always turn on the personality and style of candidates their skills at televisual performance their race and gender and how all of these interact with questions of national identity at a given historical moment the biggest difference this time is that the democratic nominee will not embody and hence reinforce the dominant position of white masculinity in the racegender system katz further maintained that presidential contests until now have been contests between men men were the gender that mattered no matter how qualified by intelligence leadership ability or experience women were not seriously considered for the top job in government and everyone knew it their gender prevented people from seeing them as presidential if there is one thing that truly represents change in this historic election season it is the change in what it means to appear presidential in the past whether a candidate was a republican or democrat conservative centrist or liberal their race and gender were predetermined they were inevitably – and invariably – white and a man” for katz violence also plays an important role in shaping political discourse and in the voters choice of whom to support for president how much of the white male vote is determined by impressions about the relative manliness or toughness of candidates or political parties hasn’t been quantified katz writes but there is no doubt that for several decades violence—both our individual and collective vulnerability to it and questions about when and how to use the violent power of the state to protect the national interest — has been an ominous and omnipresent factor in numerous foreign policy and domestic political issues eg the cold war vietnam the war on terror and the invasion of iraq as well as gun control and executive legislative and judicial responses to violent crime in several articles katz analyzes and comments on the pervasive use of sports metaphors in presidential discourse and how the language of sport functions to construct a masculine ideal for leadership at the heights of political power he points out that the two most metaphorically influential sports in presidential campaign rhetoric are boxing and football not coincidentally both are violent sports that attract a disproportionate percentage of male participants and fans the frequent use of boxing and football metaphors in political discourse did not cause violence to become an important force in our politics but this usage is one measure of how presidential campaigns in the mass media era are less about policy differences and complex political agendas than they are about the selling of a certain kind of executive masculinity embodied until the historic  election in a particular white man whom the public comes to know largely through television and other technologies of mass communication katz also comments on implications for female candidates he writes one of  republican vicepresidential nominee sarah palins mostquoted lines on the campaign trail in the fall of  was the heels are on the gloves are off which she typically delivered to wild cheers of approval in coming years when this historic campaign and those yet to come are analyzed it will be particularly interesting to see how female and male voters respond to language where a woman throws the knockout punch does this masculinize and thus help to make them more credible as potential commandersinchief or do women who are seen as tooaggressive – even if only in a metaphorical sense – turn voters off what are the differences between how the sexes view a woman throwing punches if shes a conservative like palin or a liberal feminist like hillary clinton

various violence prevention theories and educational practices the mvp model was influenced by basic tenets of social justice education this approach is partly based on the premise that men’s silence in the face of other men’s abusive or violent behavior gives implicit consent to such behavior the mvp bystander approach frames men’s abuse of women as a societal problem whose roots lie in the institutional structures and cultural practices of a maledominated society  thus the mvp approach emphasizes changing social norms as the key to prevention by challenging men to speak up and “change group dynamics in male peer culture”this bystander model empowers men to step outside of the victimperpetrator binary and gives men an opportunity to talk about some of the “dynamics of their interpersonal and group interaction in a safe space” mentors in violence prevention mvp modeledit jackson katz presented the mentors in violence prevention mvp model hoping to put the focus on men to discontinue trends of violent masculinity through creating a model that would invite men into the critical dialogue instead of painting them as perpetrators or potential perpetrators katz realized that there was a frustrating lack of inclusion of men and boys in the gender violence discussion prompting him to create an education model that was inclusive to men and boys the original mvp model was created as workshops for allmale student athletes katz hoped that by working with male student athletes they could help to stop the spread of ‘rapesupportive’ and ‘batteringsupportive’ attitudes by speaking out against the masculine binary that supports gender violence recon  katz says his initial focus on working with studentathletes stems from the “apathy defensiveness—and sometimes outright hostility—of male athletic directors coaches and studentathletesmen and young men in the…athletic subculture…typically occupy a privileged position in school culture and particularly in male peer culture”  this is a step towards the bystander approach by working with boys who typically represented the popular part of school culture katz was hoping that these boys would then influence the people around them and in their schools in similar manners it was important for katz to ensure that mvp considers male studentathletes as potential mentors for younger kids able of providing male leadership necessary to stop gender abuse katz’s model generally revolves around simulation and roleplaying as well as large discussionbased group meetings both consisting samesex and differentsex students as a part of his college initiative his mvp model involves “holding three minute sessions each year with each participating college team a fourth session is scheduled for those studentathletes who wish to be trained further for work with younger students in middle and high school”  these workshops are designed to provide spaces for boys to discuss with each other the concept of masculinity and its definition as well as its relation to gender abuse and violence additionally katz recognizes the role of those in positions of authority in schools and athletic teams as his program has grown and evolved he has included training of selected male and professional staff working in all sectors of schools and colleges in this he is hoping that the topdown approach will provide role models for young and impressionable students and athletes who are looking for good representation if these school leaders are able to use their positions of authority as positions of good influence it will perhaps encourage a change in paradigm that will affect all of those in the school or community the mvp model originally focused on just male studentathletes since the mvp model has expanded its target audience and educational group to “boys and girls men and women working together and in singlesex formats…by the mid’s mvp had moved from a nearexclusive focus on the athletic world to general populations of high school and college students and other institutional settings”  this expansion means that the dialogue around gender abuse and gender binaries is spreading throughout schools across the nation more frank and honest talk about gender abuse will not only remove many of the stigmas from those who are abused but will also encourage students to act out and speak out in defense of themselves and each other media literacy and masculinitiesedit in his writings public lectures and films katz argues that gendered understandings and behavior in every arena from interpersonal relationships to the workplace and even politics are influenced by media and popular culture focusing on normative portrayals of men in advertising television hollywood films the entertainment industries sports and politics katz calls for an examination of the poses we strike and the images of masculinity that proliferate in media culture as a way to illuminate whats going on in individual mens lives and in our culture as a whole katz further maintains that in spite of variability due to such categories as class race and ethnicity violence in america is overwhelmingly a gendered phenomenon shaped by cultural codes and ideals of masculinity and manhood he argues that masculinity and femininity are socially constructed categories and thus the disturbing equation of masculinity with pathological control and violence that currently exists in america is not genetically predetermined and can be changed in the tough guise study guide cowritten with the video producer jeremy earp of the media education foundation katz underscores his motivation for promoting media literacy by looking critically at how institutions – from media outlets to political institutions to our schools – often play a role in reinforcing constricted regressive notions of manhood that maintain an unacceptably violent status quo we might begin to clear some space for individuals male and female to live freer lives presidential masculinitiesedit katzs work on images of masculinity in media extends to his examination of a crucial but barely explored topic of cultural studies analysis the role of media culture in the construction of presidential masculinity katz posits that media have become the single most important source of political information and persuasion and that education for democracy in this era requires citizens to be media literate according to katz part of being politically media literate means understanding how gender functions as a subtextual force in presidential politics he asks questions such as how does the perceived manliness or toughness of political candidates affect their electoral success to what degree is the gender gap in presidential politics affected by mens gendered identities and sense of themselves as men which itself is reinforced by media discourses and portrayals how does paid political advertising on television – by far the biggest expenditure of funds in presidential campaigns – shape voters perceptions of the relative manliness of candidates what are the similarities and differences between how women and men ascertain whether male political figures measure up to the masculine ideal that is circulating in media culture at a given historical moment which mediated white masculine styles or archetypes have been politically successful over the past fifty years and why in an article about the barack obamahillary clinton race for the democratic presidential nomination in  katz responded to pundits and other political observers who decried the media focus on race and gender when other crucial issues loomed presidential elections are always about race and gender the reason people are talking about them now is that a black man and a white woman are serious contenders for a major party nomination their success is making visible what historically has been hidden in plain sight campaigns for the us presidency in the era of mass media he wrote always turn on the personality and style of candidates their skills at televisual performance their race and gender and how all of these interact with questions of national identity at a given historical moment the biggest difference this time is that the democratic nominee will not embody and hence reinforce the dominant position of white masculinity in the racegender system katz further maintained that presidential contests until now have been contests between men men were the gender that mattered no matter how qualified by intelligence leadership ability or experience women were not seriously considered for the top job in government and everyone knew it their gender prevented people from seeing them as presidential if there is one thing that truly represents change in this historic election season it is the change in what it means to appear presidential in the past whether a candidate was a republican or democrat conservative centrist or liberal their race and gender were predetermined they were inevitably – and invariably – white and a man” for katz violence also plays an important role in shaping political discourse and in the voters choice of whom to support for president how much of the white male vote is determined by impressions about the relative manliness or toughness of candidates or political parties hasn’t been quantified katz writes but there is no doubt that for several decades violence—both our individual and collective vulnerability to it and questions about when and how to use the violent power of the state to protect the national interest — has been an ominous and omnipresent factor in numerous foreign policy and domestic political issues eg the cold war vietnam the war on terror and the invasion of iraq as well as gun control and executive legislative and judicial responses to violent crime in several articles katz analyzes and comments on the pervasive use of sports metaphors in presidential discourse and how the language of sport functions to construct a masculine ideal for leadership at the heights of political power he points out that the two most metaphorically influential sports in presidential campaign rhetoric are boxing and football not coincidentally both are violent sports that attract a disproportionate percentage of male participants and fans the frequent use of boxing and football metaphors in political discourse did not cause violence to become an important force in our politics but this usage is one measure of how presidential campaigns in the mass media era are less about policy differences and complex political agendas than they are about the selling of a certain kind of executive masculinity embodied until the historic  election in a particular white man whom the public comes to know largely through television and other technologies of mass communication katz also comments on implications for female candidates he writes one of  republican vicepresidential nominee sarah palins mostquoted lines on the campaign trail in the fall of  was the heels are on the gloves are off which she typically delivered to wild cheers of approval in coming years when this historic campaign and those yet to come are analyzed it will be particularly interesting to see how female and male voters respond to language where a woman throws the knockout punch does this masculinize and thus help to make them more credible as potential commandersinchief or do women who are seen as tooaggressive – even if only in a metaphorical sense – turn voters off what are the differences between how the sexes view a woman throwing punches if shes a conservative like palin or a liberal feminist like hillary clinton documentariesedit katz

gender violence prevention program in the us marine corps katz and his colleagues have also conducted trainings for the us army in iraq and mvp has been piloted around the world by the us navy key ideasedit bystander approachedit katz advocates the bystander approach to gender violence and bullying prevention instead of focusing on women as victims and men as perpetrators of harassment abuse or violence the bystander approach concentrates on the role of peers in schools groups teams workplaces and other social units in  after an alleged gang rape in richmond california where two dozen teenagers watched and did nothing newsweek online reported that a small but growing group of educators is trying to bring whats called bystander education to american schools while sexual violence prevention programs have typically focused on the victim discouraging women from walking alone at night for example or the perpetrator reiterating the fact that no means no the bystander approach emphasizes the role witnesses can play in either supporting or challenging violence katz and his colleagues developed one of the first bystander initiatives the mixedgender mentors in violence prevention mvp program in  at northeastern university’s center for the study of sport in society “most people think they only have two choices for intervention” says katz “one is to intervene physically right at the point of attack and the other is to do nothing and that’s a false set of choices” as part of the mvp program students sit in a classroom and talk about the menu of options—from getting a group of friends together to calling —available to them at the heart of the program is a set of scenarios that allow students to imagine what they might do in a variety of situations each scenario comes with a list of viable interventions for bystanders according to newsweek research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of bystanderawareness programs in schools but the initial results are promising one study found that after the sioux city school district in iowa implemented the mvp program the number of freshman boys who said they could help prevent violence against women and girls increased by  percent the bystander programs that have proliferated in recent years on college and high school campuses and in the us military involve both sexes and draw from

gender violence prevention program in the us marine corps katz and his colleagues have also conducted trainings for the us army in iraq and mvp has been piloted around the world by the us navy key ideasedit bystander approachedit katz advocates the bystander approach to gender violence and bullying prevention instead of focusing on women as victims and men as perpetrators of harassment abuse or violence the bystander approach concentrates on the role of peers in schools groups teams workplaces and other social units in  after an alleged gang rape in richmond california where two dozen teenagers watched and did nothing newsweek online reported that a small but growing group of educators is trying to bring whats called bystander education to american schools while sexual violence prevention programs have typically focused on the victim discouraging women from walking alone at night for example or the perpetrator reiterating the fact that no means no the bystander approach emphasizes the role witnesses can play in either supporting or challenging violence katz and his colleagues developed one of the first bystander initiatives the mixedgender mentors in violence prevention mvp program in  at northeastern university’s center for the study of sport in society “most people think they only have two choices for intervention” says katz “one is to intervene physically right at the point of attack and the other is to do nothing and that’s a false set of choices” as part of the mvp program students sit in a classroom and talk about the menu of options—from getting a group of friends together to calling —available to them at the heart of the program is a set of scenarios that allow students to imagine what they might do in a variety of situations each scenario comes with a list of viable interventions for bystanders according to newsweek research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of bystanderawareness programs in schools but the initial results are promising one study found that after the sioux city school district in iowa implemented the mvp program the number of freshman boys who said they could help prevent violence against women and girls increased by  percent the bystander programs that have proliferated in recent years on college and high school campuses and in the us military involve both sexes and draw from various violence prevention theories and educational practices the mvp model was influenced by basic tenets of social justice education this approach is partly based on the premise that men’s silence in the face of other men’s abusive or violent behavior gives implicit consent to such behavior the mvp bystander approach frames men’s abuse of women as a societal problem whose roots lie in the institutional structures and cultural practices of a maledominated society  thus the mvp approach emphasizes changing social norms as the key to prevention by challenging men to speak up and “change group dynamics in male peer culture”this bystander model empowers men to step outside of the victimperpetrator binary and gives men an opportunity to talk about some of the “dynamics of their interpersonal and group interaction in a safe space” mentors in violence prevention mvp modeledit jackson katz presented the mentors in violence prevention mvp model hoping to put the focus on men to discontinue trends of violent masculinity through creating a model that would invite men into the critical dialogue instead of painting them as perpetrators or potential perpetrators katz realized that there was a frustrating lack of inclusion of men and boys in the gender violence discussion prompting him to create an education model that was inclusive to men and boys the original mvp model was created as workshops for allmale student athletes katz hoped that by working with male student athletes they could help to stop the spread of ‘rapesupportive’ and ‘batteringsupportive’ attitudes by speaking out against the masculine binary that supports gender violence recon  katz says his initial focus on working with studentathletes stems from the “apathy defensiveness—and sometimes outright hostility—of male athletic directors coaches and studentathletesmen and young men in the…athletic subculture…typically occupy a privileged position in school culture and particularly in male peer culture”  this is a step towards the bystander approach by working with boys who typically represented the popular part of school culture katz was hoping that these boys would then influence the people around them and in their schools in similar manners it was important for katz to ensure that mvp considers male studentathletes as potential mentors for younger kids able of providing male leadership necessary to stop gender abuse katz’s model generally revolves around simulation and roleplaying as well as large discussionbased group meetings both consisting samesex and differentsex students as a part of his college initiative his mvp model involves “holding three minute sessions each year with each participating college team a fourth session is scheduled for those studentathletes who wish to be trained further for work with younger students in middle and high school”  these workshops are designed to provide spaces for boys to discuss with each other the concept of masculinity and its definition as well as its relation to gender abuse and violence additionally katz recognizes the role of those in positions of authority in schools and athletic teams as his program has grown and evolved he has included training of selected male and professional staff working in all sectors of schools and colleges in this he is hoping that the topdown approach will provide role models for young and impressionable students and athletes who are looking for good representation if these school leaders are able to use their positions of authority as positions of good influence it will perhaps encourage a change in paradigm that will affect all of those in the school or community the mvp model originally focused on just male studentathletes since the mvp model has expanded its target audience and educational group to “boys and girls men and women working together and in singlesex formats…by the mid’s mvp had moved from a nearexclusive focus on the athletic world to general populations of high school and college students and other institutional settings”  this expansion means that the dialogue around gender abuse and gender binaries is spreading throughout schools across the nation more frank and honest talk about gender abuse will not only remove many of the stigmas from those who are abused but will also encourage students to act out and speak out in defense of themselves and each other media literacy and masculinitiesedit in his writings public lectures and films katz argues that gendered understandings and behavior in every arena from interpersonal relationships to the workplace and even politics are influenced by media and popular culture focusing on normative portrayals of men in advertising television hollywood films the entertainment industries sports and politics katz calls for an examination of the poses we strike and the images of masculinity that proliferate in media culture as a way to illuminate whats going on in individual mens lives and in our culture as a whole katz further maintains that in spite of variability due to such categories as class race and ethnicity violence in america is overwhelmingly a gendered phenomenon shaped by cultural codes and ideals of masculinity and manhood he argues that masculinity and femininity are socially constructed categories and thus the disturbing equation of masculinity with pathological control and violence that currently exists in america is not genetically predetermined and can be changed in the tough guise study guide cowritten with the video producer jeremy earp of the media education foundation katz underscores his motivation for promoting media literacy by looking critically at how institutions – from media outlets to political institutions to our schools – often play a role in reinforcing constricted regressive notions of manhood that maintain an unacceptably violent status quo we might begin to clear some space for individuals male and female to live freer lives presidential masculinitiesedit katzs work on images of masculinity in media extends to his examination of a crucial but barely explored topic of cultural studies analysis the role of media culture in the construction of presidential masculinity katz posits that media have become the single most important source of political information and persuasion and that education for democracy in this era requires citizens to be media literate according to katz part of being politically media literate means understanding how gender functions as a subtextual force in presidential politics he asks questions such as how does the perceived manliness or toughness of political candidates affect their electoral success to what degree is the gender gap in presidential politics affected by mens gendered identities and sense of themselves as men which itself is reinforced by media discourses and portrayals how does paid political advertising on television – by far the biggest expenditure of funds in presidential campaigns – shape voters perceptions of the relative manliness of candidates what are the similarities and differences between how women and men ascertain whether male political figures measure up to the masculine ideal that is circulating in media culture at a given historical moment which mediated white masculine styles or archetypes have been politically successful over the past fifty years and why in an article about the barack obamahillary clinton race for the democratic presidential nomination in  katz responded to pundits and other political observers who decried the media focus on race and gender when other crucial issues loomed presidential elections are always about race and gender the reason people are talking about them now is that a black man and a white woman are serious contenders for a major party nomination their success is making visible what historically has been hidden in plain sight campaigns for the us presidency in the era of mass media he wrote always turn on the personality and style of candidates their skills at televisual performance their race and gender and how all of these interact with questions of national identity at a given historical moment the biggest difference this time is that the democratic nominee will not embody and hence reinforce the dominant position of white masculinity in the racegender system katz further maintained that presidential contests until now have been contests between men men were the gender that mattered no matter how qualified by intelligence leadership ability or experience women were not seriously considered for the top job in government and everyone knew it their gender prevented people from seeing them as presidential if there is one thing that truly represents change in this historic election season it is the change in what it means to appear presidential in the past whether a candidate was a republican or democrat conservative centrist or liberal their race and gender were predetermined they were inevitably – and invariably – white and a man” for katz violence also plays an important role in shaping political discourse and in the voters choice of whom to support for president how much of the white male vote is determined by impressions about the relative manliness or toughness of candidates or political parties hasn’t been quantified katz writes but there is no doubt that for several decades violence—both our individual and collective vulnerability to it and questions about when and how to use the violent power of the state to protect the national interest — has been an ominous and omnipresent factor in numerous foreign policy and domestic political issues eg the cold war vietnam the war on terror and the invasion of iraq as well as gun control and executive legislative and judicial responses to violent crime in several articles katz analyzes and comments on the pervasive use of sports metaphors in presidential discourse and how the language of sport functions to construct a masculine ideal for leadership at the heights of political power he points out that the two most metaphorically influential sports in presidential campaign rhetoric are boxing and football not coincidentally both are violent sports that attract a disproportionate percentage of male participants and fans the frequent use of boxing and football metaphors in political discourse did not cause violence to become an important force in our politics but this usage is one measure of how presidential campaigns in the mass media era are less about policy differences and complex political agendas than they are about the selling of a certain kind of executive masculinity embodied until the historic  election in a particular white man whom the public comes to know largely through television and other technologies of mass communication katz also comments on implications for female candidates he writes one of  republican vicepresidential nominee sarah palins mostquoted lines on the campaign trail in the fall of  was the heels are on the gloves are off which she typically delivered to wild cheers of approval in coming years when this historic campaign and those yet to come are analyzed it will be particularly interesting to see how female and male voters respond to language where a woman throws the knockout punch does this masculinize and thus help to make them more credible as potential commandersinchief or do women who are seen as tooaggressive – even if only in a metaphorical sense – turn voters off what are the differences between how the sexes view a woman throwing punches if shes a conservative like palin or a liberal feminist like hillary clinton documentariesedit katz

expanded its target audience and educational group to “boys and girls men and women working together and in singlesex formats…by the mid’s mvp had moved from a nearexclusive focus on the athletic world to general populations of high school and college students and other institutional settings”  this expansion means that the dialogue around gender abuse and gender binaries is spreading throughout schools across the nation more frank and honest talk about gender abuse will not only remove many of the stigmas from those who are abused but will also encourage students to act out and speak out in defense of themselves and each other media literacy and masculinitiesedit in his writings public lectures and films katz argues that gendered understandings and behavior in every arena from interpersonal relationships to the workplace and even politics are influenced by media and popular culture focusing on normative portrayals of men in advertising television hollywood films the entertainment industries sports and politics katz calls for an examination of the poses we strike and the images of masculinity that proliferate in media culture as a way to illuminate whats going on in individual mens lives and in our culture as a whole katz further maintains that in spite of variability due to such categories as class race and ethnicity violence in america is overwhelmingly a gendered phenomenon shaped by cultural codes and ideals of masculinity and manhood he argues that masculinity and femininity are socially constructed categories and thus the disturbing equation of masculinity with pathological control and violence that currently exists in america is not genetically predetermined and can be changed in the tough guise study guide cowritten with the video producer jeremy earp of the media education foundation katz underscores his motivation for promoting media literacy by looking critically at how institutions – from media outlets to political institutions to our schools – often play a role in reinforcing constricted regressive notions of manhood that maintain an unacceptably violent status quo we might begin to clear some space for individuals male and female to live freer lives presidential masculinitiesedit katzs work on images of masculinity in media extends to his examination of a crucial but barely explored topic of cultural studies analysis the role of media culture in the construction of presidential masculinity katz posits that media have become the single most important source of political information and persuasion and that education for democracy in this era requires citizens to be media literate according to katz part of being politically media literate means understanding how gender functions as a subtextual force in presidential politics he asks questions such as how does the perceived manliness or toughness of political candidates affect their electoral success to what degree is the gender gap in presidential politics affected by mens gendered identities and sense of themselves as men which itself is reinforced by media discourses and portrayals how does paid political advertising on television – by far the biggest expenditure of funds in presidential campaigns – shape voters perceptions of the relative manliness of candidates what are the similarities and differences between how women and men ascertain whether male political figures measure up to the masculine ideal that is circulating in media culture at a given historical moment which mediated white masculine styles or archetypes have been politically successful over the past fifty years and why in an article about the barack obamahillary clinton race for the democratic presidential nomination in  katz responded to pundits and other political observers who decried the media focus on race and gender when other crucial issues loomed presidential elections are always about race and gender the reason people are talking about them now is that a black man and a white woman are serious contenders for a major party nomination their success is making visible what historically has been hidden in plain sight campaigns for the us presidency in the era of mass media he wrote always turn on the personality and style of candidates their skills at televisual performance their race and gender and how all of these interact with questions of national identity at a given historical moment the biggest difference this time is that the democratic nominee will not embody and hence reinforce the dominant position of white masculinity in the racegender system katz further maintained that presidential contests until now have been contests between men men were the gender that mattered no matter how qualified by intelligence leadership ability or experience women were not seriously considered for the top job in government and everyone knew it their gender prevented people from seeing them as presidential if there is one thing that truly represents change in this historic election season it is the change in what it means to appear presidential in the past whether a candidate was a republican or democrat conservative centrist or liberal their race and gender were predetermined they were inevitably – and invariably – white and a man” for katz violence also plays an important role in shaping political discourse and in the voters choice of whom to support for president how much of the white male vote is determined by impressions about the relative manliness or toughness of candidates or political parties hasn’t been quantified katz writes but there is no doubt that for several decades violence—both our individual and collective vulnerability to it and questions about when and how to use the violent power of the state to protect the national interest — has been an ominous and omnipresent factor in numerous foreign policy and domestic political issues eg the cold war vietnam the war on terror and the invasion of iraq as well as gun control and executive legislative and judicial responses to violent crime in several articles katz analyzes and comments on the pervasive use of sports metaphors in presidential discourse and how the language of sport functions to construct a masculine ideal for leadership at the heights of political power he points out that the two most metaphorically influential sports in presidential campaign rhetoric are boxing and football not coincidentally both are violent sports that attract a disproportionate percentage of male participants and fans the frequent use of boxing and football metaphors in political discourse did not cause violence to become an important force in our politics but this usage is one measure of how presidential campaigns in the mass media era are less about policy differences and complex political agendas than they are about the selling of a certain kind of executive masculinity embodied until the historic  election in a particular white man whom the public comes to know largely through television and other technologies of mass communication katz also comments on implications for female candidates he writes one of  republican vicepresidential nominee sarah palins mostquoted lines on the campaign trail in the fall of  was the heels are on the gloves are off which she typically delivered to wild cheers of approval in coming years when this historic campaign and those yet to come are analyzed it will be particularly interesting to see how female and male voters respond to language where a woman throws the knockout punch does this masculinize and thus help to make them more credible as potential commandersinchief or do women who are seen as tooaggressive – even if only in a metaphorical sense – turn voters off what are the differences between how the sexes view a woman throwing punches if shes a conservative like palin or a liberal feminist like hillary clinton documentariesedit katz

united states marine corps the related mvp strategies  distributes gender violence prevention training materials to us school districts municipalities human service programs corporations law enforcement agencies and military services katz has personally lectured at many such organizations as well and has appeared on good morning america the oprah winfrey show and abc news  his consultative role ranges has ranged from the world health organization to the liz claiborne company in march  secretary of defense william s cohen appointed him to the us secretary of defenses task force on domestic violence in the military where he served from  katz currently is a paid consultant to the us air force bystander intervention training and also acts as director of the first global gender violence prevention program in the us marine corps katz and his colleagues have also conducted trainings for the us army in iraq and mvp has been piloted around the world by the us navy key ideasedit bystander approachedit katz advocates the bystander approach to gender violence and bullying prevention instead of focusing on women as victims and men as perpetrators of harassment abuse or violence the bystander approach concentrates on the role of peers in schools groups teams workplaces and other social units in  after an alleged gang rape in richmond california where two dozen teenagers watched and did nothing newsweek online reported that a small but growing group of educators is trying to bring whats called bystander education to american schools while sexual violence prevention programs have typically focused on the victim discouraging women from walking alone at night for example or the perpetrator reiterating the fact that no means no the bystander approach emphasizes the role witnesses can play in either supporting or challenging violence katz and his colleagues developed one of the first bystander initiatives the mixedgender mentors in violence prevention mvp program in  at northeastern university’s center for the study of sport in society “most people think they only have two choices for intervention” says katz “one is to intervene physically right at the point of attack and the other is to do nothing and that’s a false set of choices” as part of the mvp program students sit in a classroom and talk about the menu of options—from getting a group of friends together to calling —available to them at the heart of the program is a set of scenarios that allow students to imagine what they might do in a variety of situations each scenario comes with a list of viable interventions for bystanders according to newsweek research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of bystanderawareness programs in schools but the initial results are promising one study found that after the sioux city school district in iowa implemented the mvp program the number of freshman boys who said they could help prevent violence against women and girls increased by  percent the bystander programs that have proliferated in recent years on college and high school campuses and in the us military involve both sexes and draw from various violence prevention theories and educational practices the mvp model was influenced by basic tenets of social justice education this approach is partly based on the premise that men’s silence in the face of other men’s abusive or violent behavior gives implicit consent to such behavior the mvp bystander approach frames men’s abuse of women as a societal problem whose roots lie in the institutional structures and cultural practices of a maledominated society  thus the mvp approach emphasizes changing social norms as the key to prevention by challenging men to speak up and “change group dynamics in male peer culture”this bystander model empowers men to step outside of the victimperpetrator binary and gives men an opportunity to talk about some of the “dynamics of their interpersonal and group interaction in a safe space” mentors in violence prevention mvp modeledit jackson katz presented the mentors in violence prevention mvp model hoping to put the focus on men to discontinue trends of violent masculinity through creating a model that would invite men into the critical dialogue instead of painting them as perpetrators or potential perpetrators katz realized that there was a frustrating lack of inclusion of men and boys in the gender violence discussion prompting him to create an education model that was inclusive to men and boys the original mvp model was created as workshops for allmale student athletes katz hoped that by working with male student athletes they could help to stop the spread of ‘rapesupportive’ and ‘batteringsupportive’ attitudes by speaking out against the masculine binary that supports gender violence recon  katz says his initial focus on working with studentathletes stems from the “apathy defensiveness—and sometimes outright hostility—of male athletic directors coaches and studentathletesmen and young men in the…athletic subculture…typically occupy a privileged position in school culture and particularly in male peer culture”  this is a step towards the bystander approach by working with boys who typically represented the popular part of school culture katz was hoping that these boys would then influence the people around them and in their schools in similar manners it was important for katz to ensure that mvp considers male studentathletes as potential mentors for younger kids able of providing male leadership necessary to stop gender abuse katz’s model generally revolves around simulation and roleplaying as well as large discussionbased group meetings both consisting samesex and differentsex students as a part of his college initiative his mvp model involves “holding three minute sessions each year with each participating college team a fourth session is scheduled for those studentathletes who wish to be trained further for work with younger students in middle and high school”  these workshops are designed to provide spaces for boys to discuss with each other the concept of masculinity and its definition as well as its relation to gender abuse and violence additionally katz recognizes the role of those in positions of authority in schools and athletic teams as his program has grown and evolved he has included training of selected male and professional staff working in all sectors of schools and colleges in this he is hoping that the topdown approach will provide role models for young and impressionable students and athletes who are looking for good representation if these school leaders are able to use their positions of authority as positions of good influence it will perhaps encourage a change in paradigm that will affect all of those in the school or community the mvp model originally focused on just male studentathletes since the mvp model has expanded its target audience and educational group to “boys and girls men and women working together and in singlesex formats…by the mid’s mvp had moved from a nearexclusive focus on the athletic world to general populations of high school and college students and other institutional settings”  this expansion means that the dialogue around gender abuse and gender binaries is spreading throughout schools across the nation more frank and honest talk about gender abuse will not only remove many of the stigmas from those who are abused but will also encourage students to act out and
