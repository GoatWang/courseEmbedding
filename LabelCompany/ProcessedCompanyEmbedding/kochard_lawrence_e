lawrence e kochard currently chief investment officer at georgetown university was today named chief executive officer of the university of virginias investment management company a macdonald caputo chairman of the uvimco board and a member of the universitys board of visitors said in his announcement that kochard will join uvimco on jan    kochard  who was the founding director of georgetowns investment office in  comes to uva with not only a strong background in finance but also with university ties including two economics degrees from the graduate school of arts  sciences he succeeds christopher j brightman who resigned earlier this year as ceo kochard will be responsible for overseeing the universitys almost  billion core endowment held by the board of visitors and cash management for the university he and his person staff also are responsible for management of certain endowment assets held by numerous university foundations the universitys total endowment including the related foundations approaches  billion the universitys endowment is one of the five largest in public higher education and in the top  among all colleges and universities larry was the unanimous choice of the uvimco board and we have every confidence that he will maintain the fine reputation of investment excellence that has been established through the efforts of his predecessors and the incredible uvimco team caputo said we are convinced that larry is the person who can provide the leadership and vision to achieve our future expectations for uvimco   kochard said he is very pleased on many levels to have been selected uvimco has one of the strongest and most respected teams in the investment world and one of the strongest and most respected boards he said i love the university of virginia and this community so this is really coming home for me   his academic credentials as well as his range of experience – from wall street and the virginia retirement system to georgetown – make him well suited him for the uvimco leadership position kochard said without realizing it i think i have been preparing for this job for the past  years he said   prior to going to georgetown kochard served from  to  as managing director for equity and hedge fund investments for the virginia retirement system from  to  he  taught in uvas mcintire school of commerce first as an adjunct and later full time as an assistant professor his teaching has included courses in investment fixed income and corporate finance at georgetown he has continued to teach one course a year and he hopes to do the same when he returns to uva   kochard said he believes that its important as the institutions chief investment officer to be connected to a universitys community and to understand not only the daily operations but also the institutions tolerance for risk   he attributes some of the investment mistakes made at universities in  to investment offices being too removed from their universities they lost sight of who they were working for kochard said i will never let that happen under my watch he currently has  student interns working in his georgetown office another way he finds to connect with the university community and something he would like to replicate at uvimco   kochard said he also understands his responsibility to connect to faculty and staff as well as to students to explain the importance of the endowment and its connection to the longterm health of the institution never before has the endowment been more important than it is today said leonard w sandridge the universitys executive vice president and chief operating officer the endowment supports our students and our programs in teaching research and health care larry understands the role of the endowment and will extend its benefits sandridge pointed to uvimcos history of outstanding investment performance and said he believes that kochard will be committed to upholding that legacy he brings the leadership and experience that will enable the uvimco team to excel he said as well as to continue the strong endowment performance that supports the university and its related foundations as contributions from the commonwealth of virginia declined over the past  years endowment earnings have become an increasingly important factor in the universitys progress president teresa a sullivan said endowment income and private gifts provide the extra margin that takes the university of virginia from adequacy to excellence they also provide flexibility to meet pressing needs and support priorities as they arise during leaner times the endowment contributes to the overall financial strength of the university she said we are entrusting mr kochard with one of our most important assets kochard received a bachelors degree in economics from the college of william  mary in  an mba in finance and accounting from the university of rochester in  and a masters and phd in economics from the
