quinsigamond the new bridge will be the fifth at this location the first being a floating bridge that consisted of logs chained together to carry the wagons and stage coaches on the bostonworcester turnpike the current concrete deck arch bridge dates to  and has been repaired and reconfigured several times in the past  years the bridge has reached the end of its useful lifespan and must be replaced the new replacement bridge will cost approximately  million and take two years to build   the replacement bridge addresses a variety of deficiencies as follows a wider profile with three east and westbound travel lanes for vehicles with bicycle accommodating shoulders on both sides new ada sidewalks on both sides with bumpouts over each pier featuring seating for regatta viewers and anyone looking to enjoy the lake a westbound right turn lane at the intersection of route  and lake avenue to accommodate motorists traveling to umass and points north from the east a westbound left turn lane at the intersection of route  and lake avenue to eliminate the current need to make a uturn north of the intersection the complete reconstruction of the intersection and installation of new traffic signal equipment to improved levels of service for vehicular traffic a more open steel construction and an open median between the east and westbound lanes of the bridge will allow light and air under the structure providing a more comfortable experience for boaters stormwater will be captured and treated before discharge to the lake   the replacement bridge will be a span steel deck arch bridge approximately  feet from end to end it will be approximately  feet wide this type was selected based on stakeholder input from the public involvement process to date the ability to minimize environmental and rightofway impacts the ability to use accelerated construction techniques lower construction and lifecycle costs bridge aesthetics and ease of construction staging more information

above an illuminated kenneth f burns memorial bridge which spans lake quinsigamond from shrewsbury to worcestersteven king photos when the lights lit up along the entire length of the kenneth f burns memorial bridge in the darkness of the first night of november the “oohs” and “ahs” were audible they grew louder moments later when fireworks shot up from a barge on lake quinsigamond pam krause granddaughter of kenneth f burns well over  people crammed the concourse at regatta point and crowded the beachfront countless others were expected to watch from their homes and cottages along the lake as local state and federal officials celebrated a million project they say came in  million under budget and four months ahead of schedule the finished product – a multilane bridge with bike lanes benches and plaques and an illuminated underbelly and sails at each end – was called “magnificent” and “beautiful” during a roughly minute ceremony that drew officials from the mass department of transportation along with lt gov karyn polito us congressman jim mcgovern and several other luminaries in the shadow of the bridge – only the second bridge in massachusetts that changes colors the leonard p zakim memorial bridge in boston is the other – the granddaughter of the bridge’s namesake said he would be “humbled” by the fanfare and expressed thanks that his name remained attached to the project fireworks explode in the shadow of the new kenneth f burns memorial bridge “my grandfather would be pleased with the way the bridge was done so crews could still function” said pam krause whose grandfather kenneth burns was a crew coach for  years at shrewsbury high school pam krause and her husband also coach crew at the school kenneth burns was also chief of police in shrewsbury and was a former commissioner for the state division of fish  game the bridge built in  was named after kenneth burns in  about a year after his death “is beautiful they’ve done a great job with it” pam krause said of the bridge “my grandfather would love this i think he would really enjoy this bridge” polito said the “spectacular bridge” serves the community as a link to “our storied past to the quality of the present and to our bridge future” massdot secretary and ceo stephanie pollack  said the bridge “represents what happens when engineers and designers listen to the people who live in the community” from the arches on the bridge designed to accommodate sailboats to sustainable led lighting to benches for those who want to rest as they walk along the bridge the project sought to meet the needs of many pollack said state sen harriette chandler joined others in congratulating all involved with the project including the contractors the middlesex corporation she also waxed a bit poetic about the bridge saying it would “outlive all of us” not long before the lights were turned on at the bridge chandler made one more rather fitting observation “i wanted this bridge to outzakim the zakim bridge” she said not many on hand appeared to disagree related articlesmore from author worcesteria lower speed limit belmont bridge fbi raid worcesteria sweet closed cell phone pain
