company jun fleas and tips from paul and debbie michael categories pauls world tips and trends with over  years of shopping buying and selling at flea markets all over the country paul and debbie michael are happy to share a few good tips on how to find the best stuff  all flea markets have a really small community of antique dealers and vendors who travel the country and show up together to attend the circuit of shows that usually occur from spring all the way through fall  it is easy to look online to find a flea market near you step  – get there early beat the crowds  if the event starts on a friday and it is a larger size show it is a good idea to arrive a day or two early  lots of trading among dealers take place as they unload their trucks and trailers  the early bird catches the worm get there early step  – if there is a site map available it is a great idea to get one  familiarize yourself with the grounds and ask where the best dealers usually set up be specific about what you are hunting for  whether it be antique buttons military items vintage clothing crafts etc keep your eye on the prize   the dealers generally set up in the same spots which ends up being like a community or little neighborhood  if you are really in it for the hunt and are just looking for whatever catches your eye find the areas where dealers set up that do not come on a regular basis  some markets refer to this as the unreserved area  their tables ‎will be filled with anything and everything this is the spot where you just might find your hidden gem get a map   step  –  it is always a good idea to have a specific item in mind when you begin your hunt  do a little research if you are on the hunt for specific items so you will have a good idea of the current market price  paul says “the most important ingredient of buying an item is deciding in your mind what you are willing to pay and what the true market value is”  keep in mind that the price the dealer is asking will be at market value or a little above  half the fun of attending the flea market to find your treasure is not only the hunt but also the negotiation  dealers appreciate the art of a negotiation  be prepared and do not google an item in the presence of a dealer  there are definite rules of etiquette to follow when making a deal and this is a big insult to a dealer  they tend to be a little cranky anyway and this could ruin your chances of buying your merchandise at a lower price  once you have spotted the item of interest you need to decide in your mind what you are willing to pay for it  feel free to check it out as much as you like and ask as many questions as you have  you will find that most of the dealers are honest knowledgeable and enjoy sharing any and all the information they have keep your eye on the prize save some good stuff for us     may diy summer florals categories diy the summer season brings with it a whirlwind of florals we only have the opportunity to see

trends bedrooms are often the most private rooms in the house making them the most personal  one’s personal style is  usually best reflected in the bedroom so adding bedding and headboards to our

now getting into the beginning of summer we have had the opportunity to stage a handful of empty houses as well as give some livedin residences a pmc home makeover  staging an empty house comes with no design restraints so the process is fairly painless  the challenges arise when decorating or redecorating a home  people often feel they must stay within one style element in order to create an attractive interior  paul michael company designer jenny believes people often limit themselves when thinking they must stay within the confines of certain design  “it happens all the time  people think they can’t buy new pieces they are in love with because it won’t mix with their existing decor” jenny says “but it is so easy to integrate new pieces with existing decor seamlessly” here at paul michael company we believe turning a house into a home entails knowing what style you like but also keeping an open mind when it comes to integrating new pieces into your existing design giving a house personality is when it really becomes a home recently our monroe store manager debra moved into a new house and immediately requested jenny’s assistance when making this space her own  debra gave jenny free reign when it came to putting this look together other than telling her she gravitates toward “shabby chic” designs  integrating new pieces with debra’s existing decor and adding a bit of flare jenny and monroe employee ashley transformed an empty house into the home debra hoped for dining area dining area dining area dining area click for reclaimed oak dining table
