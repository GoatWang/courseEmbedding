architectural practice as well as that of other design professionals it is primarily about the services offered by architectural and small design firms but it also has as much to do with the notion of change within the design professions as it does with marketing concepts as a result the reader may find some thoughts and ideas somewhat provocative but is intended primarily to bring a new perspective on the practice because of changing trends and rapidly changing market conditions we must as design professionals prepare ourselves to communicate and interact with a much broader segment
