ott of west collingswood heights whose father pierson m ott was a structural steel worker and foreman of the work crew on the new jersey side during its construction from  to   ott says his father was a daredevil james ott was born in camden and lived in the kresson gardens fairview section  he and his wife marian then moved to bellmawr park  when four homes were being built in west collingswood heights they bought one before it was finished  they have lived there since  he attended school at st peter and paul’s in camden st joan of arc in fairview and then went to vocational school to learn welding  he started to work as a butcher and left that field because of the influx of supermarkets and went to work with rca  as a maintenance welder  he retired from there after  years  he and his wife are the parents of james jr and robert  “james jr is much like his grandfather because he loves boats” mrs ott noted  “he and his grandfather both lived and breathed their jobs” “james jr is the top civil engineer for all the forts rebuilding and remodeling them” ott sr says  “the army hired him right out of christian brothers college because of his good record there and he worked his way up to being top man  he travels from one fort to another  fort monmouth is historical and i think it is the oldest” james jr has won awards from the united states federal government for running the best fort in the united states fort monmouth  he also won another award which was the third highest award the government gives a civilian  their grandchildren are danielle kathy regina robert and angela and their greatgrandchildren are madison and conner  mrs ott has always worked around restaurants  her mother built country gardens which is now called lambert’s and she helped her to run that for a long time  she also ran south jersey vending for  years  ott remembers that his father was very successful in his work and that he was very clever  “they wanted him to be on the bridge commission and he refused because it was a political job” ott explained  “so pc hull steel erection hired him as a superintendent and he worked for them until he died  he wouldn’t let me follow him  he wouldn’t let me work outside  i wanted to get a union card and he threatened to have me flagged if i did” ott has a lot of his father’s tools and memorabilia  he has a piece of cable from the bridge which his dad had one end pressed into a letter opener and the other end has a handle made from a coupling  he told him “don’t lose this jimmy it is part of the bridge” there are pictures of the bridge in progress in his collection  “i have pictures of the towers going up” he commented  “for its height and length it is still the strongest bridge in the world  it had its history for the strongest bridge for its height and length up until four years ago and there is another bridge similar to it but it is not as strong as this one  this has a lot of steel in it  it is really built “the cable comes down to the anchorage” he continued  “in the anchorage there is an elevator that goes down to the street  they intended to have that as the entrance to go up to the trolleys  they intended to put trolleys there years ago  inside that anchorage all the walls are marble with paintings on them  they were going to have a shopping center there while the people waited for a trolley “it seems that the rails that were put on when the bridge was built were different from ptc at that time and the bridge commission was in authority  ptc said that they were not running over there unless the rails were changed  the commission said they should change the rails and they were not changing them  so they held off until the port authority took over and there were no questions asked  the port authority changed the rails on the bridge  that is when the speedline started  “when the speedline came in the first stop was broadway in camden” he added  “they bypassed the anchorage  the spot they fixed up all went to waste money thrown away  if the trolleys had been used there would have been one stop at the anchorage where you got on at linden street in camden to go up the elevator to catch the trolley and go across the bridge  it is still there but it is closed to the public  i have pictures of the anchorage showing big arms coming out and down in the casings that hold the cable  the arms move that cable moves two inches and the bridge also sways  they have to keep that oiled and greased and they have to keep it open for maintenance”  after ott’s father crossed straddling a cable with no net beneath him he lost the name pierson and he was called “jersey ott” one of the jobs he did when he was contracting was to fix the clock on the city hall in camden  he lowered himself in a boatswain’s chair and set the clock  the newspaper reported it by saying “jersey’s time is the right time” ott likes west collingswood heights because it is a nice quite area  he keeps in touch at the township meetings which he attends  he belongs to the west collingswood heights fire company  “they didn’t have any fire hydrants from the black horse pike in and i lived two blocks in from the pike” he says  “the township was unsuccessful in getting hydrants  so i went to the state and got in touch with the insurance association  they like to know if properties have protection  they came to a township meeting and they made them put the hydrants in on wilson avenue  it was a struggle but i was very successful  “what amazes me is how remarkable the engineer was to figure that all out all those years ago” he concluded  “it is a proud thing to know that my dad was such a major part of it” “he was a great man a good father he took care of his family and was very strict  if you walked the wrong side of the chalk line you were going down to the cellar”  it is the other way now children sue their parents” ott says that the story of his father is on the internet  “i did all this to more or less honor my dad because he was a wonderful man and he was great to us” he added  “the least i can do is having some remembrance of him  i loaned my pictures to the port authority to use for the birthday of the bridge  sitting on that cable he had more nerve than i have” who first crossed new river bridge ah that’s the question one admits shinning it another confesses he beat’em all  but boss walked over who first crossed the delaware over the new suspension bridge is likely to prove a mooted question four gangs of workmen labored feverishly for two weeks to finish the first footpaths  each man had a secret desire to be the first to cross that he might relare it to his grandchildren and stand along with washington  yesterday they were within speaking distance of each other  then the big bosses dimmed their dream with an order to suspend any man attempting to cross before the formal opening by chief engineer modjeski  but what is the loss of a job to men who work in constant danger of their lives with ninety feet still to be completed pierce ott foreman of the south span of the camden side declares he shinned across the swaying cable  this was at  a m and it didn’t phase him a bit he said  “i just tossed a leg across the cables grabbed hold with both hands and worked my way over” he said casually  “nobody who works up there cares about the height  it only took mea couple of minutes” ott lives at  spruce st camden is married and has two sons matthew five and william four  matthew who shows promise of being as frisky as his wiry father said that this was no feat and demonstrated his ability to skip along the porch railing until his mother saw him  but foreman have more liberties than do laborers  george morgan an iron worker who lives in blackwood nj stole his crossing during the lunch hour  morgan tells how he waited on the top of the philadelphia tower after his fellow workmen went down in the “basket” the gap had shortened by this time to twenty feet dangling from the swaying cable in much the same manner as ott he gained the camden side  now the distinction of being the first in literally walk across the delaware seems to belong to george bowers superintendent of construction  he is a veteran bridge builder and is credited with being the first to walk across the hudson over the poughkeepsie bridge  bowers walked the entire  feet from tower to tower beginning on the philadelphia side just after the last section of planking had been laid at  o’clock  it was a  minute trip he said all this however is behind the back of officialdom so to speak  the bridge commission knows nothing about it who says he was first to cross the delaware over the new suspension bridge  he shinned ninety feet of cable between the unfinished foot paths  two others claim the honor of being first to cross the span  bridge awaits cable spinners workmen of twin towers divided by eager rivalry with the footbridge between camden and philadelphia over the delaware river complete workmen today started on preliminary tasks of constructing the main cables which will carry the completed span  the footbridge completed yesterday consists of two festoons of boardwalk stretched from the cable the footways look like two great yellow ribbons stretched across the  feet curve from shore to shore each is eight feet wide  much rivalry has developed between the two sets of workers at the end of the bridge during their months of work in preparation for linking the two cities  the men on the jersey side are jubilant over the fact that they finished their end of the river yesterday several hours before the philadelphia end was complete  the honor of the first crossing on the new bridge was taken by a man from the philadelphia gang george c morgan  years of blackwood  this jersey man made the dizzy passage over the center of the river on the bare cable for a distance of  feet  he crossed to the jersey side and back at noon yesterday while the other men were at lunch  pierce ott  years  spruce street camden foreman or “pusher” of the gang that claimed the honor of finishing the first of the camden side had declared he would be the first to cross and that he would not wait for the boardwalk to be complete  his intentions were wrecked early yesterday when an accidental blow on his nose by a timber sent him off the work for a day  other foremen under superintendent greene on the camden side are george bowers jr son of the veteran bridge worker at the head of the philadelphia workers  bill salders of maple shade and jo strom  south seventh
