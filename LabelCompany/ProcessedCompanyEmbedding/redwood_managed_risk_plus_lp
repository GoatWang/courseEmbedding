hubbard hubbard decision research time  sec running monte carlos is the only way to analyze big uncertain decisions john zhao suncor energy time  min its mandated at suncor to do monte carlo simulation on all major projects capital cost estimates risk analysis is part of every decision we make we are constantly faced with uncertainty ambiguity and variability and even though we have unprecedented access to information we can’t accurately predict the future monte carlo simulation also known as the monte carlo method lets you see all the possible outcomes of your decisions and assess the impact of risk allowing for better decision making under uncertainty what is monte carlo simulation monte carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making the technique is used by professionals in such widely disparate fields as finance project management energy manufacturing engineering research and development insurance oil  gas transportation and the environment monte carlo simulation furnishes the decisionmaker with a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action it shows the extreme possibilities—the outcomes of going for broke and for the most conservative decision—along with all possible consequences for middleoftheroad decisions the technique was first used by scientists working on the atom bomb it was named for monte carlo the monaco resort town renowned for its casinos since its introduction in world war ii monte carlo simulation has been used to model a variety of physical and conceptual systems how monte carlo simulation works monte carlo simulation performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values—a probability distribution—for any factor that has inherent uncertainty it then calculates results over and over each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions depending upon the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them a monte carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is complete monte carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values by using probability distributions variables can have different probabilities of different outcomes occurring  probability distributions are a much more realistic way of describing uncertainty in variables of a risk analysis  common probability distributions include normal – or “bell curve”  the user simply defines the mean or expected value and a standard deviation to describe the variation about the mean  values in the middle near the mean are most likely to occur  it is symmetric and describes many natural phenomena such as people’s heights  examples of variables described by normal distributions include inflation rates and energy prices lognormal – values are positively skewed not symmetric like a normal distribution  it is used to represent values that don’t go below zero but have unlimited positive potential  examples of variables described by lognormal distributions include real estate property values stock prices and oil reserves uniform – all values have an equal chance of occurring and the user simply defines the minimum and maximum  examples of variables that could be uniformly distributed include manufacturing costs or future sales revenues for a new product triangular – the user defines the minimum most likely and maximum values  values around the most likely are more likely to occur  variables that could be described by a triangular distribution include past sales history per unit of time and inventory levels pert the user defines the minimum most likely and maximum values just like the triangular distribution  values around the most likely are more likely to occur  however values between the most likely and extremes are more likely to occur than the triangular that is the extremes are not as emphasized  an example of the use of a pert distribution is to describe the duration of a task in a project management model discrete – the user defines specific values that may occur and the likelihood of each  an example might be the results of a lawsuit  chance of positive verdict  change of negative verdict  chance of settlement and  chance of mistrial during a monte carlo simulation values are sampled at random from the input probability distributions  each set of samples is called an iteration and the resulting outcome from that sample is recorded  monte carlo simulation does this hundreds or thousands of times and the result is a probability distribution of possible outcomes  in this way monte carlo simulation provides a much more comprehensive view of what may happen  it tells you not only what could happen but how likely it is to happen monte carlo simulation provides a number of advantages over deterministic or “singlepoint estimate” analysis probabilistic results results show not only what could happen but how likely each outcome is graphical results because of the data a monte carlo simulation generates it’s easy to create graphs of different outcomes and their chances of occurrence  this is important for communicating findings to other stakeholders sensitivity analysis with just a few cases deterministic analysis makes it difficult to see which variables impact the outcome the most  in monte carlo simulation it’s easy to see which inputs had the biggest effect on bottomline results scenario analysis in deterministic models it’s very difficult to model different combinations of values for different inputs to see the effects of truly different scenarios  using monte carlo simulation analysts can see exactly which inputs had which values together when certain outcomes occurred  this is invaluable for pursuing further analysis correlation of inputs in monte carlo simulation it’s possible to model interdependent relationships between input variables  it’s important for accuracy to represent how in reality when some factors goes up others go up or down accordingly an enhancement to monte carlo simulation is the use of latin hypercube sampling which samples more accurately from the entire range of distribution functions palisade monte carlo
