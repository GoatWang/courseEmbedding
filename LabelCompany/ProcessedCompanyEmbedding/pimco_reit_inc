shares offered  shares outstanding  lockup period days  lockup expiration  quiet period expiration  cik  we estimate that our net proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock after deducting the underwriting discount and our estimated offering and organizational expenses will be approximately  million based on the offering price of  per share set forth on the cover of this prospectus we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately  million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full concurrently with this offering we also expect to sell  million of shares of our common stock to certain members of our senior management team and certain other executives of pimco and its affiliates in a private placement at the initial public offering price per share resulting in aggregate net proceeds of  million or  million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full no underwriting discount or commission is payable in connection with the concurrent private placement we intend to contribute the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement to our subsidiaries which in turn will use a significant portion of the net proceeds to purchase agency mbs subject to our investment guidelines and to the extent consistent with maintaining our reit qualification and our exemption from the  act the balance of the proceeds will be used to acquire other assets in accordance with our objectives and strategies described in this prospectus we believe the depth and liquidity of the mbs market will allow us to invest a significant portion of our remaining capital in a relatively short period of time however until appropriate assets can be identified for the net proceeds our manager may invest the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement in interestbearing shortterm investments andor funds that may invest in similar investments which subject to our conflicts of interest policy may include funds managed by pimco or its affiliates provided that any additional fees payable to pimco attributable to our equity investment in such funds are credited against any base management or incentive fees payable by us or otherwise rebated to us including money market accounts that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a reit these interestbearing shortterm investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to achieve from our target assets our profitability depends in large part on our ability to acquire our target assets at attractive prices we are subject to significant competition in acquiring our target assets in particular we will compete with a variety of institutional investors including other reits specialty finance companies public and private funds commercial and investment banks hedge funds mortgage bankers commercial finance and insurance companies governmental bodies and other financial institutions we may also compete with pimco and its affiliates for investment opportunities there are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with pimco and its affiliates including our manager which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders in addition there are several reits with similar investment objectives including a number that have been recently formed and others may be organized in the future these other reits will increase competition for the available supply of commercial mortgage and other real estaterelated assets suitable for purchase or origination some of our anticipated competitors have greater financial resources access to lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that may not be available to us such as funding from the us government if we are not eligible to participate in programs established by the us government in addition some of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with reit tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the  act furthermore some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments or pay higher prices than we can current market conditions may attract more competitors which may increase the competition for our target assets an increase in the competition for such assets may increase the price of such assets which may limit our ability to generate attractive riskadjusted returns for our stockholders thereby adversely affecting the market price of our common stock in the face of this competition we expect to have access to our manager’s and its affiliates’ professionals and their industry expertise which we believe will provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential investments we expect that these relationships will enable us to compete more efficiently and effectively for attractive investment opportunities in addition we believe that current market conditions may have adversely affected the financial condition of certain competitors thus not having a legacy portfolio may also enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities although we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the extensive competition in our market sector we operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and future competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of these securities company description we are a newly organized real estate finance company that intends to acquire manage and finance directly or through our subsidiaries agency mbs non agency rmbs cmbs residential and commercial real estate loans other commercial real estate debt residential and commercial real estate and other real estaterelated assets we refer to all of the above assets as our target assets our objective is to seek to provide attractive riskadjusted returns to stockholders over the long term primarily through dividends and distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation by investing directly or indirectly principally in our target assets we will seek to employ a flexible and relative value focused investment strategy and expect to reallocate capital from time to time among our target assets we believe this flexibility will enable us to more efficiently manage risk and deliver attractive riskadjusted returns under a variety of market conditions and economic cycles we will be externally managed and advised by pimco reit management llc our manager we are organized as a maryland corporation and intend to elect and qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending december   we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders and maintain our intended qualification as a reit we also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the investment company act of  as
