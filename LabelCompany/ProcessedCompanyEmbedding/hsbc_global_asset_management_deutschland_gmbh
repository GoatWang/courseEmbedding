takeaways we remain neutral global equities and corporate bonds and underweight developed market dm government bonds we also continue to be overweight local currency emerging market em government bonds and em equities global equities were little changed in june supported by data showing robust economic activity which helped offset concerns over a tightening of global monetary policy the federal open market committee fomc raised the fed funds target rate by bps at its june meeting also signalling it would begin unwinding its balancing sheet later this year the european central bank ecb reflected a more positive economic outlook at its june meeting with the reference to taking rates “lower if needed” dropped from its statement despite signs of a slowing uk economy the june bank of england monetary policy committee mpc meeting saw three mpc members vote for a rate increase in china authorities continue to tighten financial and property policies however activity growth should remain resilient in the near term global central banks gradually move to a tighter policy stance although the acceleration in global economic activity since the summer of  has slowed slightly overall conditions remain on a solid footing this positive cyclical backdrop has seen the fed continue along its tightening cycle and the ecb and boe both strike a more hawkish tone at their june meetings nevertheless we also recognise that inflation trends remain subdued not only should this translate to a very gradual normalisation of policy but also support consumer spending in this context and given relative valuations we continue to favour global equities over dm government bonds with a preference for japan eurozone and em equities over the us for us treasuries we now measure a negative implied term premium ie we are being penalised for bearing duration risk given upside risks to us inflation in the context of a tightening labour market this reinforces our underweight positioning in this asset class along with other dm government bond markets elsewhere the current marketimplied odds for taking credit risk is still not particularly attractive and we maintain a neutral stance amid stable fundamentals finally we remain overweight in em local currency debt and equities although the investment case for the latter is driven by economic and price momentum and cheap currencies rather than anomalous valuations equities asset class view view movement global neutral us neutral uk neutral eurozone overweight japan overweight emerging markets em overweight asia ex japan overweight cee  latam neutral government bonds asset class view view movement developed market dm underweight us underweight uk underweight eurozone underweight japan underweight em local currency overweight

markets are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those inherent in established markets any performance information shown refers to the past and should not be seen as an indication of future returns you should always consider seeking professional advice when thinking about undertaking any form of investment basis of views and definitions of ‘long term asset class positioning’ tables views are based on regional hsbc global asset management asset allocation meetings held throughout june  hsbc global asset management’s longterm expected return forecasts which were generated as at  may  our portfolio optimisation process and actual portfolio positions icons  view on this asset class has been upgraded  no change  view on this asset class has been downgraded underweight overweight and neutral classifications are the highlevel asset allocations tilts applied in diversified typically multiasset portfolios which reflect a combination of our longterm valuation signals our shorterterm cyclical views and actual positioning in portfolios the views are expressed with reference to global portfolios however individual portfolio positions may vary according to mandate benchmark risk profile and the availability and riskiness of individual asset classes in different regions “overweight” implies that within the context of a welldiversified typically multiasset portfolio and relative to relevant internal or external benchmarks hsbc global asset management has or would have a positive tilt towards the asset class “underweight” implies that within the context of a welldiversified typically multiasset portfolio and relative to relevant internal or external benchmarks hsbc global asset management has or would have a negative tilt towards the asset class “neutral” implies that within the context of a welldiversified typically multiasset portfolio and relative to relevant internal or external benchmarks hsbc global asset management has or would have neither a particularly negative or positive tilt towards the asset class for global investmentgrade corporate bonds the underweight overweight and neutral categories for the asset class at the aggregate level are also based on highlevel asset allocation considerations applied in diversified typically multiasset portfolios however usd investmentgrade corporate bonds and eur and gbp investmentgrade corporate bonds are determined relative to the global investmentgrade corporate bond universe long term asset class positioning  months asset class view movement rationale equities global neutral positive factors global economic growth momentum remains solid driving global equity markets to deliver positive returns over the long term overall support from still loose accommodative monetary policy and an increased willingness for looser fiscal policy will in the medium and longer term likely outweigh any headwinds from more modest chinese growth tighter us and eurozone monetary policy and political uncertainty in many regions risks to consider fairly narrow implied equity premia excess return over bonds limits the ability of the market to absorb bad news episodic volatility may be triggered by concerns surrounding chinese growth us economic policy andor a potentially more rapid than expected fed tightening cycle coupled with political risks a notable and persistent deterioration of the global economic outlook could also dampen our view us neutral positive factors us profits data has shown improvement amid a broadly robust economic backdrop corporate tax reform looser regulation and fiscal stimulus under the trump administration present an upside risk to earnings overall our measure of the implied risk premium excess returns over government bonds remains consistent with a neutral positioning risks to consider relatively high current valuations lead to an implied risk premium that is lower than in many other developed markets the policy outlook under the trump administration remains highly uncertain more recently we have seen slight softness in us whole economy profits uk neutral positive factors positive global economic momentum and the potential for further sterling weakness supports the uk earnings outlook given a large dependency on foreign earnings gains in commodity prices would also be a positive overall current valuations are consistent with a neutral positioning in our view risks to consider the prospective reward to bearing equity risk in the uk is relatively low compared to other markets the uk economy could slow amid sterlinginduced inflationary pressures and brexitrelated uncertainty eurozone overweight rationale of overweight views we favour eurozone equities due to their higher implied risk premia and scope for better earnings news given the region’s earlier point in the activity cycle furthermore the monetary backdrop remains supportive with ultralow interest rates likely to persist until the end of the decade risks to consider valuations have become less attractive following the recent rally according to recent polls the upcoming italian elections should see the eurosceptic star movement perform well also the outcome of brexit negotiations is highly uncertain brexitrelated trade disruptions andor slower uk gdp growth will likely hit eurozone exports ecb monetary policy may also be less accommodative than expected japan overweight rationale of overweight views relative valuations and risk premia are attractive in our view whilst the bank of japan’s boj extremely loose monetary policy and the government’s recent fiscal stimulus package may boost earnings large corporate cash reserves provide japanese firms with the scope to boost dividends or engage in stock repurchases earnings momentum is showing signs of picking up risks to consider domestic economic fundamentals are relatively sluggish with an absence of momentum in wage growth despite tight labour market conditions emerging markets em overweight rationale of overweight views we believe em equities remain attractive for westernbased investors usd gbp or eur based given our expectation of longerterm currency appreciation however we continue to be selective focusing on countries with strong underlying macro fundamentals and positive price momentum risks to consider aggregate em equity valuations no longer look anomalously cheap there could be some nearterm volatility as worries persist around the uncertain path for future fed tightening the potential for increased trade protectionism economic transition in china and the robustness of the global economy as a whole geopolitical uncertainty also poses risks asia ex japan overweight rationale of overweight views improving earnings and profitability and more efficient use of cash levels on balance sheets support rising return on equity amid an export recovery better domestic growth and supportive global and regional monetary policy structural reforms and shareholderreturn policies are potential catalysts in some markets valuations look reasonable risks to consider a sharp rise in us treasury yields is a key risk fed balance sheet reduction and ecb tapering could raise uncertainty us protectionist policies remain a major risk other risks include geopolitical events commodityprice volatility a fragile or faltering global growth recovery and renewed concerns about china’s growth and financial risks cee  latam neutral positive factors brazil exited recession in q and is embarking on an ambitious reform agenda whilst mexico’s economy is resilient poland has low levels of us dollardenominated debt and along with russia and hungary offers attractive risk premia in our view risks to consider geopolitical tensions are also high and unpredictable high local cash rates and sovereign yields in many countries diminish the case for bearing equity risk government bonds developed markets dm underweight rationale of underweight views prospective returns still look low relative to competing asset classes in a bondunfriendly environment strong global activity the prospect of fiscal easing global bond yields could move higher still positive factors government bonds still provide diversification benefits and reduce volatility within multiasset portfolios meanwhile “secular stagnation” forces are powerful ageing populations low productivity and investment and the global pool of safety assets is limited therefore the “normalisation” of bond yields could take several years us underweight rationale of underweight views the us labour market is at or close to full employment so underlying inflationary pressures are likely to build especially if fiscal stimulus materialises in addition prospective returns still look low relative to competing asset classes positive factors today’s environment of “price stability” means that the term premia compensation for bearing duration risk may be capped at a lower level relative to history uk underweight rationale of underweight views prospective uk gilt returns remain very low although the uk economy could slow any support in this respect may be offset by inflationary pressures positive factors amid downside risks to growth uk monetary policy is likely to stay accommodative for a longer period eurozone underweight rationale of underweight views similarly core european bonds are overvalued in our view a key risk is the likelihood of further tapering of the ecb app after december  positive factors core inflationary pressures in the region remain subdued which should keep accommodative monetary policy in place for an extended period of time japan underweight rationale of underweight views japanese government bonds jgbs are overvalued in our view whilst the boj’s commitment to peg year yields close to zero could be reevaluated the boj has also recently reduced the amount of its jgb purchases positive factors the “yield curve control” framework should limit volatility and reduce the risk of higher yields in the nearterm meanwhile boj governor kuroda has indicated that cutting policy rates could play a central role in future policy decisions emerging markets em overweight rationale of overweight views the yield available on em sovereign bonds makes them attractive relative to dm government debt in our view furthermore our estimate of the sustainable return on em currencies reinforces our choice to hold this position unhedged risks to consider spreads in the em debt universe are at risk of widening as us policy tightens corporate bonds global investment grade ig neutral positive factors the prevailing macro environment remains supportive for credits implied recession probabilities are near zero – the default outlook appears benign risks to consider valuations do not appear anomalously cheap with low implied credit premia meaning that the margin of safety is now very thin against any negative shocks such as tighter than expected us monetary policy usd investment grade neutral positive factors us investment grade debt looks more attractive relative to european credit carefullyselected us credit may outperform risks to consider lower relative valuations for usddenominated credit is offset in the nearer term by the risk of a more aggressive pace of fed tightening the us credit cycle is more mature than that in europe which remains nascent eur and gbp investment grade neutral positive factors the ecb’s corporate bondbuying programme remains supportive meanwhile in the eurozone the latest survey data suggests a gradual improvement in credit conditions and default rates remain low valuations are still around neutral levels risks to consider european credits could be hit as the ecb tapers its appuk credits are vulnerable given the recent completion of the boe corporate bond buying programme amid downside risks to the uk economic outlook global highyield neutral positive factors corporate fundamentals are improving following a pickup in the global activity cycle defaults remain comparatively low and we think they are likely to be contained to commodityrelated sectors risks to consider further credit spread compression leaves a thin margin of safety we are neutral with a negative bias other gold neutral positive factors fed hikes are likely to remain historically gradual limiting the opportunitycost of holding the nonyield generating asset rising inflationary pressures could boost hedging demand whilst high political risksuncertainty could also be supportive risks to consider a strongerthanexpected fed hiking cycle may push the usd higher other commodities neutral positive factors with oil demand growth remaining robust there is scope for the market to continue to rebalance particularly following opec’s november output cut deal extended to march  risks to consider oil markets could remain oversupplied especially if us production remains resilient industrial metals remain exposed to the pace of china’s economic rebalancing and global growth real estate neutral positive factors based on our dividend growth assumptions and current yields which offer a premium of around  per cent points above the dividend yield from wider equities we believe real estate equities are priced to deliver reasonably attractive longrun returns compared to developedmarked government bonds in the long run rents are positively related to wider economic growth and offer a partial inflation hedge risks to consider the us has underperformed other listed property markets in recent months concerns over the health of some retailers have dragged down retailoriented real estate investment trusts in this environment we believe higher quality malls and shopping centres are likely to outperform stocks with weaker portfolios  the uks decision to leave the eu has reduced rental growth prospects especially in central london and increased uncertainty around future occupier demand source hsbc global asset management all numbers rounded to one decimal place past performance is not an indication of future returns global central banks shift to a more hawkish stance markets global equities little changed in june oil prices fell on oversupply concerns year treasuries dipped global equities were little changed in june supported by data showing robust economic activity which helped offset concerns over a tightening of global monetary policy the msci ac world index closed flat over the month in the us the sp  rose  per cent with financial stocks outperforming on a steeper yield curve supporting banks’ profitability outlook and the us federal reserve’s decision to allow major us banks to engage in share buybacks european stocks retreated however as a surge in the euro against the us dollar weighed on exporter shares in the region in emerging markets the msci em rose  per cent although the msci russia fell for the third consecutive month amid further falls in oil prices as investors remained concerned that the market is oversupplied due to rising output from libya and the us in the government bond space year us treasuries and core european bonds fell yields rose mainly on concerns about the trajectory of global monetary policy all data above as of close of  june in local currency price return monthtodate terms us the fed is committed to its rate hiking cycle despite soft inflation prints us underlying economic activity remains positive our “nowcast” measure of underlying activity is tracking growth of  per cent for june slightly higher than may  per cent meanwhile core pce inflation declined for the fifth consecutive month to  per cent in may further away from the fed’s  per cent target this continued anaemic inflation backdrop is puzzling to many in the context of labour market tightening nevertheless the fed appears committed to its rate hiking cycle raising the fed funds target rate by bps at its june meeting whilst maintaining its projection for one more hike by yearend this meeting also saw the fed signal it would begin unwinding its balancing sheet later this year overall we think that the current environment of strong growth alongside higher interest rates and balance sheet normalisation reinforces the case for being underweight in us treasuries especially given that we now measure a negative implied term premium ie compensation for bearing duration risk eurozone strength of activity maintains speculation of ecb taper in  in the eurozone recent data remains very robust with the final release of q gdp revised up to  per cent qoq positively there seems to be a broadening of growth drivers to investment and exports whilst more high frequency indicators such as the pmis indicate this strength continued into q the ecb reflected the more positive outlook at its june meeting with the reference to taking rates “lower if needed” dropped from its statement although inflationary pressures remain elusive the preliminary estimate for june headline inflation fell to  per cent yoy the strength of recent economic data and importantly diminished deflation risks combined with technical buying constraints remain compelling arguments for a taper of the ecb’s qe programme next year macron’s election victory in france also removes a key event risk whilst the unlocking of eurbn new loans for greece during the month ensures the country will be able to make bond payments due in july amid signs that the country will regain market access in the near term an important breakthrough for greece also came in the form of the eurozone’s agreement to introduce a growthdependent debtprofiling mechanism this means more debt relief will be granted if greek growth deteriorates overall we retain our overweight view on eurozone equities given relatively attractive risk premia on offer uk election outcome raises brexit related uncertainty a year on from the uk’s referendum on eu membership the uk economy is looking increasingly vulnerable as inflationary pressures bite into disposable incomes despite this the june bank of england meeting saw the monetary policy committee mpc take a hawkish turn with three mpc members voting for a rate increase predominantly driven by concerns over accelerating inflation although the probability of a nearterm rate hike has risen we expect the doves to prevail given risks to the uk economic outlook are firmly tilted to the downside furthermore june’s uk general election result has also complicated the outlook for brexit with uncertainty over the stability of the conservativedup alliance struck in the aftermath of the result the range of outcomes remains very wide for the time being we retain our neutral stance on uk equities asia chinese growth should remain resilient despite policy tightening japan qe taper remains a long way off in china the impact of financial deleveraging is evident in may’s m money supply growth which fell to a record low of  per cent yoy despite recent signs of an incrementally slower pace of liquidity and regulatory tightening we think the authorities are not likely to reverse their tightening of financial and property policies however activity growth should remain resilient in the near term elsewhere the bank of japan boj kept its monetary policy unchanged in june although it has recently reduced the amount of japanese government bond purchases fuelling speculation about a possible qe tapering however boj governor kuroda stated following the meeting that “with the  per cent inflation target still some way off it is not appropriate to talk about how an exit is going to work” overall a continuation of ultraloose boj policy along with attractive risk premia supports our overweight view on the country’s equities em economic performance broadly remains on an improving trend although political risk is a key constraint following two years of contraction brazil’s economy expanded in q gdp by  per cent qoq annualised positively an improving inflation profile may hasten the path to recovery as it gives the central bank extra room for monetary easing against this encouraging economic backdrop investors shrugged off news during the month of president temer’s indictment for corruption similarly russia’s economy is improving amid closetotarget inflation and central bank accommodation this is particularly positive given the recent volatility in oil prices elsewhere the mexico’s central bank raised interest rates by another bps at its june meeting but signalled that this could be the end of the tightening cycle an aggressive fed tightening path and us policy shifts in particular nafta renegotiations remain a key risk less positively south africa unexpectedly slipped into recession in q for the first time since  and is still vulnerable to political upheaval finally in india even though it stood pat on interest rates at its june meeting the country’s central bank turned dovish in its policy statement after slashing its inflation forecasts and reducing its growth projections for the coming quarters importantly the goods and services tax gst which will be rolled out on  july could pose some risks to nearterm growth due to inventory drawdowns and potential disruption to smes but the impact is likely to be transitory source hsbc global asset management all numbers rounded to one decimal place past performance is not an indication of future returns global strategic asset allocations global strategic asset allocations as at  may  global equities rose for a seventh straight month in may supported by continuing robust economic data releases and generally upbeat earnings reports the implied equity premia on offer continues to warrant a neutral positioning for global equities in our view and we maintain our relative preference for european and japanese equities which offer a better carry opportunity in the credit space spreads have compressed substantially over the past  months amid the risk of tighter than expected us monetary policy however a mix of good growth and low inflation should sustain low default and downgrade rates finally year us treasuries rose yields fell amid doubts about the trump administration’s ability to implement progrowth policies with our measure of the implied term premium on year treasuries having become more negative overall valuations in bunds gilts and japanese government bonds remain extreme and we continue to be structurally underweight in dm government bonds within the
