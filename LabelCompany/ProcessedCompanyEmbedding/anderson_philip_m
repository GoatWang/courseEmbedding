anderson born december   is an american physicist and nobel laureate anderson has made contributions to the theories of localization antiferromagnetism symmetry breaking including a seminal paper in  discussing symmetry breaking in particle physics leading to the development of the standard model around  years later and hightemperature superconductivity and to the philosophy of science through his writings on emergent phenomena contents  education and early life  career and research  awards and honors  personal life  publications  books  journal articles  references  external links education and early lifeedit anderson was born in indianapolis indiana and grew up in urbana illinois he graduated from university laboratory high school in urbana in  afterwards he went to harvard university for undergraduate and graduate work with a wartime stint at the us naval research laboratory inbetween in graduate school he studied under john hasbrouck van vleck career and researchedit from  to  he was employed by bell laboratories in new jersey where he worked on a wide variety of problems in condensed matter physics during this period he developed what is now called anderson localization the idea that extended states can be localized by the presence of disorder in a system invented the anderson hamiltonian which describes the sitewise interaction of electrons in a transition metal proposed symmetry breaking within particle physics this played a crucial role in the development of the standard model and the development of the theory behind the higgs mechanism which in turn generates mass in some elementary particles created the pseudospin approach to the bcs theory of superconductivity made seminal studies of nonswave pairing both symmetrybreaking and microscopic mechanism in the superfluidity of he and helped found the area of spinglasses he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in  from  to  anderson was a professor of theoretical physics at cambridge university in  anderson was awarded the nobel prize in physics for his investigations into the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems which allowed for the development of electronic switching and memory devices in computers coresearchers sir nevill francis mott and john van vleck shared the award with him in  he was awarded the national medal of science he retired from bell labs in  and is currently joseph henry professor of physics emeritus at princeton university andersons writings include concepts of solids basic notions of condensed matter physics and the theory of superconductivity in the hightc cuprates anderson currently serves on the board of advisors of scientists and engineers for america an organization focused on promoting sound science in american government he is a certified first degreemaster of the chinese board game go anderson has also made important conceptual contributions to the philosophy of science through his explication of emergent phenomena in  he wrote a now highly cited article called more is different in which he emphasized the limitations of reductionism and the existence of hierarchical levels of science each of which requires its own fundamental principles for advancement a  statistical analysis of scientific research papers by josé soler comparing number of references in a paper to the number of citations declared anderson to be the most creative amongst ten most cited physicists in the world awards and honorsedit he was awarded the oliver e buckley condensed matter prize in  the
