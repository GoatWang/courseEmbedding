of underappreciated and undervalued assetsapr  about hmgcourtland properties hmg jan svenda contrarian eventdriven deep value longshort equitysummarythis small and forgotten ‘quasireit’ is showcasing a straightforward value opportunity due to the fact that a number of owned assets are over depreciated on its balance sheeton top of this the shares are trading at  discount to unadjusted tangible book this offers investors exposure to the company with a significant margin of safetyin essence investors are able to buy several properties at little additional cost as company’s liquid securities and cash net of total liabilities consist of  of current market capitalizationwhile the undervaluation is clear hmg is controlled by its ceo which might not be incentivized to reward all shareholders and might not be pressured to realize the underlying valuealthough i believe that the value could be unlocked soon as hmg started a new real estate project which will either start delivering profit or potentially be soldinvestment thesis hmgcourtland properties inc hmg is an interesting opportunity that i believe allows investors to buy that notorious dollar for  cents due to the following points the market is significantly undervaluing the assets that hmg owns the liquid assets securities and cash are currently worth  million the real estate assets and other investments add another  million while the total liabilities only amount to  million at the current market capitalization of  million this presents a significant upside of  should the company trade at its tangible book which i believe is reasonable the upside could be even stronger as a number of the real estate assets and other investments are likely to be over depreciated a good example is the corporate headquarters in miami florida which hmg carries on the balance sheet at roughly  million according to several real estate listings it could be worth at least  million hmg also holds an investment in a real estate partnership in florida at zero carrying value since last year which was previously held at  million and several other assets that could be further accretive to the valuation last but not least the company entered into a partnership with two other realestate orientated firms in  in order to build a multifamily apartment complex in orlando florida hmg has a  equity interest in this project which cost  million to build the initial investment is carried at  million on the balance sheet the complex was completed in august of  and by december st  of it was already leased i believe that should the project be fully successfully reaching at least  of capacity it could either start to generate meaningful income or potentially be sold after refinancing of the initial loan as hmg did sell some of its development projects in the past the company also pays roughly a  dividend per annum while the asset undervaluation is enticing there are few things to keep in mind the realization of the underlying value is uncertain given the fact that the longstanding ceo mr maurice wiener controls the company as he owns roughly  of the shares through direct and indirect holdings thus he might not share the same incentives with minority shareholders although the new orlando project could act as a catalyst which does not depend on actions of mr wiener another risk could be that hmg is going to decrease its book value through operational costs the company does not generate a meaningful amount of rental revenue and thus the ongoing costs matter these are predominantly tied to compensation of mr wiener and his related entities so far though this has not been a major issue as hmg does generate a meaningful amount of ‘other income’ from dividends and trading gains which are derived from the company’s marketable securities and several smaller investments i would also say that mr wiener is not incentivized to overcompensate himself as he wants hmg to succeed in the end as it is likely to be a substantial amount of his net worth the other minor risk is connected to the new orlando project because hmg is jointly liable for a substantial loan  million that depends on the success of the project vacancy of the apartments it does not seem to have any issues though so far and thus it is unlikely that hmg should face any significant liabilities from it i believe that by buying shares of hmg you are in essence coinvesting with mr wiener which might not be the most beneficial setup but i believe that given his past track record and the undervalued nature of the opportunity the risks are well offset by the potential reward and thus at least a statistical position is warranted historical overview hmg was founded in  and was likely to be controlled by mr wiener since at least  the company is structured as reit and invested in real estate around the us in the past in the ’s and ’s the main value of the company was in grove isle hotel club and adjacent marina which the company continued to develop throughout the years hmg sold its interest in this property in  for  million which resulted in  million gain this was also the only time the market really appreciated the value of hmg’s assets as the stock price more than tripled overnight after the sale closed since then though the market continued to ignore what is going in the company hmg used the proceeds to add roughly  million to its portfolio of marketable securities which consists mostly of other listed reits and corporate bonds they also expanded their investments into private equity funds and other real estate partnerships the biggest of which was the orlando project to which hmg paid roughly  million in  the company also paid out a  million special dividend on top of the usual  million one in the past the company was not run with an income statement profit in mind as the company never owned a substantial amount of assets that would be able to offset the operational costs and generate enough revenue this though never resulted in a significant cash burn as the losses were offset by income from the marketable securities and distributionsdividends from other investments as seen below note in  and  the company invested in the aforementioned orlando project and marketable securities since the  sale the company’s operating costs are running at roughly  million per annum as seen below note in  the company had to spend extra  million on legal fees connected to cases tied to the grove isle property which were settled and did not impact the operational results these costs are then at least partially offset by the newly increased other income i believe that despite the volatile nature of this income stream i do not expect the company to start to bleed cash or liquid assets anytime soon orlando project one of the main reasons for that is the newly developed project which could either start contributing to hmg’s income statement or could be possibly sold after the operations stabilize and the entity that owns the complex refinances its debt the complex is located in southwest orlando and consists of  luxury apartments that are available for lease the project was finished in around august  and had a grand opening on the th of october on the st of december hmg mentioned that  of the apartments were already leased as per recent annual report there are several reviews online which are predominantly positive and the only few negative comments are regarding pricing not the quality of the apartments or any other possible issues with the complex therefore it seems that the project is on track this is important to state as the joint venture entity that was created for this purpose borrowed  million for the construction from wells fargo this loan has several requirements connected to it the most important one is that  of the apartments need to leased by cca october  it also has to generate certain operating profit by then if this does not occur the borrowers are liable to pay down a portion of the loan as wells fargo can request a new appraisal of the property i believe though that this is unlikely to occur as the project does not seem to suffer from any significant challenges furthermore i believe that it is likely that investors are going to refinance the initial loan that matures in  the new loan might be more lenient in terms of requirements as the complex will have past operational performance i would also say that hmg might want to sell its stake once this occurs among other reasons it could be that mr wiener who is now  might want to start to wind down his investments although as i will show in the next section even if the orlando project is not materially successful this is likely to have only a limited impact on the upside valuation as aforementioned the key point of the thesis lies in the balance sheet of hmg which is undervalued by the market on top of that several assets are likely to be over depreciated as seen below starting with the marketable securities the company mentioned that the portfolio mainly consists of around  preferred stock positions and roughly  common stock position in various listed reits the company regularly traded in and out of these positions which lead me to believe that the investments should be liquid and should not be exposed to any significant risk other than the usual macro risks such as the decline of the whole reit sector etc the ‘other investments’ item is a mixture of private equity funds which the company invested in since at least ’s and smaller real estate partnerships the pe fund side of the investments has not brought much value or at least not yet hmg receives distributions from time to time from these funds but usually reinvests the proceeds back due to the commitments to the funds the company does not showcase what exact funds they are invested in but in  the sec had a question regarding these and the company showed a detailed list of the positions it seems that at that time the company was invested in relatively mainstream pe funds most of the asset value is currently in funds invested in ‘diversified businesses’ as seen below note the company did not showcase this breakdown in its annual report the real estate partnerships ‘real estate and related’ then account for the second biggest asset in this item again the company does not showcase individual investments but given the  list it is unlikely that the investments could be undervalued given the small stakes in each project the only material exception is an investment in grand bay grove llc which hmg accounts for in level  measurement grand bay grove is a developer of offices at grand bay plaza in miami florida in  hmg received a distribution of roughly  million from the llc which resulted in a decrease in the carrying value as pointed out below the current carrying value is zero the rest of the level  item value are likely to be immaterial investments as pointed out by hmg below the table in the k i believe that as it likely that the investment is an equity stake in the developer given the  listing of the positions it is probably worth more than that this is the first instance of an underappreciated asset on hmg balance sheet and while it might not be material enough to impact the overall valuation i believe it serves as a potentially offsetting factor should the pe funds be overvalued on the balance sheet or should they decrease in the future therefore the item ‘other investments’ is likely to be carried at appropriate values the ‘investment in affiliate’ item is tied to the  equity stake of hmg in an entity called tgif texas inc ‘tgif’ the rest of which is owned by transco realty trust an entity controlled by mr wiener tgif was originally set up to handle franchise of tgi friday’s chain of restaurant in texas and louisiana as per k from  but currently the entity likely holds only one property that is leased out to a restaurant operator in baton rouge louisiana the company does not showcase enough information thus i am not sure what exact property the entity owns but it does seem to generate a stream of income as tgif regularly pays out  million per annum in dividends to hmg these dividends then decrease the carrying value of the investment on the balance sheet in  for example the item was held at  million on the balance sheet if the dividend is any indication of how much they are able to gain from the property it could be that the item is over depreciated but as of now this is not clear although should the dividends continue the item is likely to be over depreciated at some point in the future given this i believe that the investment in affiliate is unlikely to be overvalued and thus the carrying value could be accurate and could become over depreciated in the future next item is ‘loans notes and other receivables’ which mainly consists of  million loan connected to the sale of grove isle properties in  which should be repaid by  the rest is connected to at least one florida real estate developer interest on all loans have been collected in accordance with the agreements thus i believe that the carrying value is accurate ‘investment properties’ is the most interesting item as this is likely to be clearly over depreciated the item includes the following properties the  square feet ‘corporate office’ is located in a luxury part of miami and the whole property could be worth at least  million according to various listings this could result in at least  million additional value the land in massachusetts might be immaterial but the rhode island piece could be worth substantially more due to these listings it might be that hmg could be able to sell it for at least  million which would result in  million of additional value the vermont property seems to be a vacant commercial building and adjacent land as seen in google street view but it certainly could be valued at more than  million hmg has mentioned that they are thinking of developing the property thus it might add further value to hmg’s balance sheet given the potential over depreciation i believe that the item ‘investment properties’ could be undervalued by at least  million excluding vermont the last significant item on the balance sheet is the carrying value of the orlando project which is now  million which almost matches the contributions that hmg paid into the joint venture as mentioned in the previous section should the project start to generate operating income or be potentially sold it could results in significant additional value due to the fact that the whole complex was built for  million this though is unclear for now and therefore i believe one can say that the current carrying value is accurate due to all this i believe that the market is significantly undervaluing the company while the management might not have the same incentives to unlock the value the risks at least for now are offset by the balance sheet in the end even the sec thought it was strange that the company traded below the book value while owning these assets as it asked the company to try to explain this in  via explanation of how they account for the properties etc conclusion i have to say that hmg presents a rare opportunity especially since the stock is listed the balance sheet value is relatively liquid and clearly shows that the market capitalization is not reasonable as it completely discounts almost every other investment apart from marketable securities and cash while the issue here is the catalyst the management might be incentivized to liquidate in the long run in the meantime hmg might sell their interest in the orlando project which could partially unlock some of the value or at the very least

individually and as a general partner in martine avenue associates naf associates and the jim fieber trust defendants civ a no  court of chancery of delaware new castle county submitted june  decided july    william d johnston james p hughes jr of young conaway stargatt  taylor wilmington rolin p bissell aileen camacho of schnader harrison segal  lewis philadelphia pa for plaintiff of counsel francis j trzuskowski of trzuskowski kipp kelleher  pearce wilmington frank j silvestri jr marcy tench stovall of zeldes needle  cooper bridgeport ct for defendant norman a fieber of counsel edward m mcnally of morris james hitchens  williams wilmington paul s berger of fowler white burnett hurley banick  strickroot miami fl for defendants lee gray and betsy gray saffell of counsel opinion strine vice chancellor this case involves thirteen year old real estate sales transactions between hmgcourtland properties inc as seller and two of hmgs directors lee gray and norman fieber as buyers while fiebers selfinterest in the transactions was properly disclosed neither he nor gray informed their fellow directors that gray — who took the lead in negotiating the sales for hmg — had a buyside interest grays interest was concealed from hmg for a decade and was only discovered inadvertently by the company in  in this posttrial opinion i find that fieber and gray breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and care and defrauded the company i award relief to hmg designed  to remedy the harm caused by their misconduct i the facts a parties and key players plaintiff hmgcourtland properties inc hmg is a delaware corporation whose principal place of business is in dade county florida hmg is a publicly held real estate investment trust reit that invests in commercial real estate since  maurice wiener has served as hmgs chairman of the board and chief executive officer ceo wiener also holds a major equity position in hmg both directly and through his ownership of a major portion of transco realty trust which in turn is hmgs largest shareholder at all relevant times wiener was also chairman ceo and a  shareholder in courtland group inc the adviser which served as hmgs investment adviser from  through  defendant lee gray was at all relevant times a director president and treasurer of hmg he also served as a member of the hmg boards audit and executive committees like winer gray had a significant equity interest in hmg through his direct ownership of shares in hmg and through his  interest in transco gray also served as president treasurer director and a  shareholder in the adviser defendant norman a fieber fieber was a director of hmg and a member of hmgs audit committee from  until  fieber is a builder and real estate developer in southwestern connecticut in  or  fiebers son james a fieber jim fieber left the private practice of law at the firm of kelly drye  warren to join his fathers development business defendant betsy gray saffell saffell is lee grays sister along with lee gray saffell was from  to  one of two general partners in martine avenue associates martine a general partnership on december   martine was dissolved b the role of hmgs adviser like many reits hmg relies heavily upon its investment adviser hmg has no employees of its own and the adviser operates as the management of hmg subject to the oversight and control of hmgs board of directors all recommendations regarding hmgs real estate investments flow through the adviser and are presented by the adviser to the hmg board for its services the adviser receives compensation pursuant to a contract approved annually by hmgs independent ie nonadviser affiliated directors during the period relevant to this litigation wiener and gray were the key decisionmakers at the adviser although winer was the ceo of hmg and the adviser and gray was the president of each wiener and gray operated less as superior and subordinate and more as the longstanding colleagues and friends they were each contributed complementary skills and personal styles to the ventures with wiener applying himself more constantly to hmg and the adviser than gray since gray had several other business ventures both however were committed fulltime to the adviser and hmg and received remuneration commensurate with fulltime responsibilities this coequal relationship was reflected in the decisionmaking process used by the adviser which was one of consensus although wiener and gray are both men of strong views they apparently worked together quite effectively and always reconciled their differences before making recommendations to hmg on behalf of the adviser in  wiener and gray brought larry i rothstein on board as hmgs and the advisers senior vice president secretary and chief financial officer  after rothstein arrived he functioned as part of a triumvirate that made decisions on behalf of the adviser given his more recent arrival the longstanding relationship between wiener and gray and the substantial economic interests wiener and gray had in hmg and the adviser rothstein occupied a less influential position than gray and wiener rothstein viewed wiener and gray quite appropriately as his superiors nonetheless during the period relevant to this case rothstein was an important officer and decisionmaker at the adviser c hmg considers a major transaction involving the grossmans portfolio in  hmg and transco invested in  retailindustrial parcels the grossmans portfolio or the portfolio located in the northeastern united states and leased by grossmans inc grossmans which operated a chain of homeimprovement stores through a joint venture called south bayshore associates sba hmg and transco owned  of the grossmans portfolio with hmg owning  and transco owning  during  and  wiener and gray began to give serious consideration to undertaking a major transaction to generate additional return from the grossmans portfolio which by then had been downsized to  properties as part of their consideration of how to maximize value from the grossmans portfolio sba commissioned appraisals of the portfolio in  the  appraisals or appraisals the appraisals were intended to help wiener and gray determine whether it made sense to sell interests in the grossmans portfolio through a syndication to refinance the portfolio or to sell the portfolio tr   two factors impelled wiener and gray to consider these options first it appears that hmgs  stockholder transco and perhaps hmg itself faced some cash flow difficulties in  and  tr  dx  the precise extent of those difficulties is not clear from the record and i have no basis to believe that those difficulties were of great urgency tr   however those difficulties did lead wiener and gray to consider options to increase cash flow to these related entities — entities which were described by an hmg independent director as one pair of pants with two pockets tr  second in  grossmans parent corporation entered bankruptcy although this potentially endangered sba rental revenue from the grossmans portfolio it also suggested the possibility that several if not all of the properties in the portfolio might soon be able to be developed or sold free and clear of any leasehold d gray suggests that hmg approach fieber about a joint venture involving the purchase of a share of the grossmans portfolio in late  or early  gray suggested to wiener that they approach norman fieber about entering into a joint venture as to the grossmans portfolio the rationale for such a venture was that fieber could help hmg maximize the development potential of the portfolio since most of the grossmans properties were in the northeastern united states and since fieber had a successful development company in that region fieber seemed ideally positioned to help hmg figure out how best to exploit the portfolio in particular fieber had the knowhow to assist hmg in redeveloping properties in the portfolio to the extent that the grossmans leases for whatever reasons were terminated at the time gray suggested this idea norman fieber was a member of the hmg board he had gained his entrée to that position through gray whom he had known for many years and who had introduced fieber to wiener in the s although gray and fieber were not close  personal friends they had a lasting and deep business friendship that involved investing in each others projects on a thinlydocumented basis reflective of substantial mutual trust furthermore gray knew that fieber was interested in doing a deal with hmg since  fieber had been interested in pursuing a joint venture with hmg involving the acquisition of shopping centers in florida tr  wiener agreed with gray that a joint venture with fieber made business sense since gray had a longstanding relationship with fieber and since gray spent a good deal of time in new york not far from fiebers connecticut home it was agreed that gray would pursue the idea of a joint venture directly with fieber e gray undertakes negotiations with fieber in early  gray began to discuss the grossmans portfolio on a serious basis with norman and jim fieber these discussions centered quickly on a basic concept the fiebers would buy a percentage interest in the grossmans portfolio a joint venture would be formed in which the fiebers would take the lead in managing and redeveloping the properties in the portfolio as to a particular portfolio property close to the fiebers base of operations — the property in wallington connecticut wallingford — the fiebers would own a supermajority stake because they had a particular interest in redeveloping that property as to the rest of the portfolio the fiebers would buy a tobe negotiated minority percentage substantial enough to give them a real incentive to maximize returns from the portfolio for the sake of simplicity i will refer at times to the collective venture between hmg and the fiebers involving both wallingford and the grossmans portfolio as the joint venture i will also refer to the transactions involving both collectively as the transactions the negotiations between gray and fieber as to price and percentage of ownership initially centered on wallingford and were to be consequential for the determination of the terms upon which fieber later took an interest in the remaining properties in the portfolio these negotiations seem to have begun in earnest in february  and to have been spurred on by discussions after an hmg board meeting that month after that meeting gray and fieber discussed the portfolio at that time gray told fieber that martine would be interested in investing in fiebers side of any transaction with hmg if fieber was going to utilize coinvestors to close the deal tr  fiebers practice of using coinvestors to do transactions was wellknown to gray since gray and his partnership martine were frequently among the coinvestors in fieberled transactions at trial gray testified that he always knew that fieber used other investors to fill out his package tr  and that fieber always asked me to take a piece of his investments tr  fieber testified that gray said that gray could not invest on fiebers side of the deal personally but that martine could tr   fieber also testified that he understood martine to be a partnership owned and operated for the benefit of  members of grays family but not for the benefit of gray personally tr  fieber claims to have sloughed off grays overture by telling gray that it was too early to talk about coinvestors but that he would include martine if he did bring in other investors tr  he also contends that he gave little thought to the propriety of grays overture because he assumed that the person that is president of a listed corporation knows what hes saying  and knows regulations tr  see also tr  neither gray nor fieber informed wiener or any other member of the hmg board that gray wished to invest on fiebers side of the joint venture instead gray proceeded to negotiate the terms of the joint venture on behalf of hmg — focussing first on the terms of the wallingford deal in early march gray and fieber discussed the price that fieber would pay for his share of wallingford during that conversation gray had a memorandum in his hand from jim lavin the property manager for the portfolio the lavin memorandum described a  offer for wallingford which had been made by an adjoining property owner in the memo lavin recommended rejection of the offer as below market px a lavin also further recommended updating the  appraisal on the property and listing the property if a sale was contemplated the  appraisal had valued wallingford at  on a leased fee basis the leased fee value and  on a fee simple ie nongrossmans lease encumbered basis the fee simple value gray and fieber deny that gray disclosed the  offer to fieber yet gray admits that he had lavins memo in his hand when he discussed wallingford with fieber tr  it is likely that gray either shared the offer price or targeted price discussions on a price near that offer grays contemporaneous handwritten notes of his conversation with fieber — which are set forth on a copy of the lavin memorandum — refer to  px a as troubling grays notes indicate that fieber was already contemplating bringing in coinvestors on his side of the deal the notes refer to howard lerner a personal friend of fiebers who regularly invests in fieberled transactions px a tr  fieber admits telling gray at that time that lerner might invest in the deal tr  in fact lerner was later to become an investor on fiebers side of the transactions the notes also state syndicate  or  which i infer to refer to the possibility that fieber would bring in  or  investors on his side of the transactions px a in a subsequent memorandum to fieber from gray which was not copied to wiener or rothstein gray indicated that he would convey the m offer to maurice on wallingford px  that memorandum also indicates that gray would be forwarding fieber information on the grossmans properties for syndication and or purchase id the reference to syndication is disturbing because it again suggests the active possibility that fieber would be bringing in coinvestors on his side of any deal in terms of the percentage split between hmg and fieber grays notes state hmg  and norm lee  px  this was the ownership split that was ultimately agreed to regarding wallingford most troubling of course is the reference to lee as being part of the  with norm id gray did as he said and conveyed the  offer and the proposed ownership split to his colleagues wiener and rothstein during these discussions at the adviser level gray characterized fieber as a tough negotiator who was not giving quarter however the offer was so far below  even the leased fee value that the three of them agreed that the offer should be rejected but apparently had no problem with the proposal that fieber buy  of the property based on his understanding that gray had been doing his best to get a good deal wiener suggested that gray convey a  counteroffer roughly tied to the leased fee value of the property tr  this was at the lower range of wieners price objective which had been to get a price tied as closely as possible to the fee simple value of the property in the  appraisals tr  gray communicated this counteroffer to norman fiebers son jim fieber tr  together the fiebers decided to respond with a  offer that offer was communicated to hmg by a letter from jim fieber to wiener on march   px  wiener gray and rothstein met to discuss the offer at that meeting gray recommended that hmg accept the offer i credit wieners testimony that gray said words to the effect he only offered  to begin with now ive gotten him up to  its really been tough and we should take it tr  given the relationship of trust between gray and wiener wiener would have placed a great deal of weight on grays view of the negotiating posture of fieber grays advice coupled with the fact that hmg was considering a joint venture with one of its own directors posited on future cooperation was a very important factor in wieners and rothsteins decisionmaking process based on grays advice the three of them decided to accept fiebers  offer that is to accept fiebers offer to pay  to buy twothirds of the property tr   this decision was significant in more than the obvious way by accepting a price at less than leased fee value hmg set a precedent for the next phase of the negotiations which would focus on the remaining properties in the portfolio in essence the wallingford price centered the remaining negotiations on the leased fee value and left wiener and rothstein with the impression that there was no viable way to get fieber to pay anything close to the fee simple value thus hmgs earlier goal of getting a price at or near that value was essentially abandoned f hmg and fieber negotiate the sale of the portfolio properties once the wallingford transactions terms were more or less finalized hmg and the fiebers turned their attention to the terms on which the parties would enter a joint venture regarding the remaining  properties in the portfolio frankly the evidence regarding this aspect of the negotiations is quite sketchy for the sake of clarity this transaction will be sometimes called the naf transaction since the joint venture vehicle created by norman fieber to hold his side of the joint venture is called naf associates in the wake of agreement on the terms of the wallingford deal it is my sense that wiener was anxious to close on the naf transaction gray continued to lead hmgs efforts in that regard and to be in close contact with both norman and jim fieber by this point wiener and rothstein had formed the view based on grays depiction of fiebers negotiating position in the wallingford transaction that they could not get fieber to pay a price at or approaching the fee simple value in the  appraisals while still willing to do a deal with fieber wiener and rothstein with no objection from gray set the leased fee value as a floor for the naf  transaction it was grays job to bring the transaction to closure much of the parties attention regarding the naf transaction negotiations is focussed on whether a meeting among wiener gray rothstein norman fieber and jim fieber at the stamford connecticut sheraton hotel occurred in april or may of  both the defendants contend that the meeting occurred in early to midapril they assert that the meeting focussed on the economic terms of the naf transaction and that the two principal spokespersons at the meeting were wiener for hmg and jim fieber on behalf of his father according to the defendants jim fieber negotiated at that meeting for a price based on less than the leased fee value jim fieber premised his argument on the potential environmental problems at some of the sites and other factors that made their development potential less than certain in response wiener is said to have insisted that the fiebers either take a deal based on the leased fee value or leave it tr  norman fieber assented to that demand subject to a review of all the  appraisals clear title and inspection of the properties tr    at the end of the meeting the parties allegedly agreed to move the wallingford and naf transactions to closure as rapidly as possible tr  for its part hmg through the testimony of wiener and rothstein places the meeting in may after the wallingford transaction had closed and after they say the basic economic terms of the naf transaction had been agreed upon they contend that the meeting was not intended as a negotiation but as an opportunity for hmg to sit down facetoface with fieber and to get a read on how enthusiastic he was to undertake the joint venture and to discuss how the joint venture would operate it rings truer to me that the sheraton meeting occurred in may or early june for the primary purpose hmg articulates than that it occurred in april for the purpose articulated by the defendants the only documentary evidence of the sheraton meeting is contained in handwritten notes by jim fieber dated  which list as itemnumber five meeting naf lg mw sheraton town centre dx  this document indicates that negotiations regarding the structure of the joint venture were still ongoing as of that date because it also refers to a meeting  negotiation with rothstein in new york city on july   id a may or june date is also more consistent with the defendants own testimony that the parties agreed to move the transaction to closure rapidly since the transaction closed on july   — a closing date that was certainly not rapid as measured from april the fiebers rather erratic memory of the sheraton meeting see n fieber  originally testifying that the meeting occurred in june j fieber  not recalling whether rothstein attended and the fact that i found wiener and rothstein to be more credible witnesses than the defendants also lead me to conclude that it is slightly more likely that the meeting occurred in may or june on the other hand i acknowledge the force of the defendants contrary argument that argument draws strength from a flurry of activity in the latter part of april that is indicative of parties attempting to reach agreement on a transaction activity i will describe in a moment before discussing the defendants key evidence regarding the date of the sheraton meeting let me emphasize that i place far less weight on that issue than do they unlike them i do not find the timing issue to be critical for the following reason by april wiener and rothstein believed that gray had been duking it out with fieber since february while they had bought into grays view that hmg could not get a price near the fee simple value they had drawn a bottom line at the leased fee value by the time jim fieber tried to get an even lower value than that at the sheraton  meeting whether in april may or even june wiener and rothstein believed that gray had already communicated that bottom line to the fiebers and that the fiebers understood and had agreed to it i part from the defendants in believing that this means that wiener rather than gray was the most influential person at hmg in terms of setting the price to the contrary wiener and rothstein premised their position on price on grays earlier unsuccessful efforts to get a higher price on wallingford and his reports of fiebers tough almost unyielding negotiating stance by the end of an over two month period of negotiations wiener and rothstein were not prepared to haggle further they wanted to get a deal done or move on this view of the evidence is consistent with what happened in late april on april   gray wrote to norman fieber regarding appraisals the fiebers had requested px  the next day gray wrote to jim fieber twice urging him to put an offer at leased fee value in writing px   in fact gray went so far as to enclose a draft of the offer letter px  although gray testified that he did so at wieners instruction i disbelieve his testimony since he did not bother to copy wiener on his correspondence to jim fieber continuing the pattern of references to his own interest in fiebers side of the deal grays files contain a document attached to the draft offer letter setting forth grays calculations of the purchase price the word martine is written on the note px  at m the same day rothstein wrote to hmgs outside counsel about the proposed transactions and directed him to draft an agreement for the joint venture modeled on the sba joint venture px  that letter said that hmg would hold  of the naf transaction joint venture and fieber would hold  — the percentages that were used in the final transaction on april   jim fieber sent an offer letter to wiener based substantially on the text sent to him the previous day by gray dx  the april  letter contained the essential terms that were to be incorporated in the final naf transaction unlike the defendants i believe the fiebers april   offer at leased fee value is as consistent with a may date for the sheraton meeting as with an april date this is so for two reasons first none of the late april documents refer to the sheraton meeting which is odd if it was the meeting that produced the agreement in principle second it makes sense to me that the joint venture partners would meet facetoface after the economic terms were set to discuss how to proceed and begin to cement a working relationship especially since the joint venture agreements were still being negotiated well into june see eg px  to the extent jim fieber used such an occasion to attempt to retrade the april   offer price this would explain wieners supposed take it or leave it approach bolstering the may meeting theory is norman fiebers june   letter confirming the price of the naf transaction at a price tied to the leased fee value and indicating that closing would occur on july   or sooner px  this letter — drafted by gray and typed by grays secretary in new york — is consistent with a later date for the sheraton meeting and with the notion that jim fieber was attempting to renegotiate the earlier agreement in principle based on his due diligence subsequent to april   g the final terms of the transactions the final terms of the wallingford transaction required the fiebers to pay  or twothirds of  to hmg and transco in proportion to those  entities respective interests in the wallingford property in exchange hmg conveyed a onehalf interest and transco conveyed a onesixth interest in the wallingford property to the fiebers the final terms of the naf transaction required the fiebers to pay to naf  in cash a price proportionate to  of the leased fee value of the grossmans portfolio the fiebers also assumed  of the liabilities of the portfolio in exchange hmg conveyed a  interest in the grossmans portfolio to naf to facilitate this exchange hmg engaged in an earlier transaction in which it purchased transcos  share of the grossmans portfolio at a price also based on the leased fee value as a result hmgs overall ownership interest in the grossmans portfolio dropped from  to  h gray takes a buyside interest in the wallingford transaction the wallingford transaction closed on may   gray signed the deeds granting the fiebers ownership of twothirds of the property unknown to wiener or rothstein however gray at fiebers invitation had joined a group of investors on the fiebers side of the transaction through martine gray invested  in the wallingford transaction by a check dated may   — the same date the transaction closed howard lerner and jim fieber also invested in the transaction there is no evidence that grays interest in martine was disclosed in any manner to hmg at that time i the fiebers seek out other investors for the transactions the fiebers claim that they decided to involve other investors only after the economic terms of the wallingford transaction had been finalized they say that their decision to do so was based on a site visit jim fieber conducted subsequent to the agreement in principle during that site visit and during his inspection of certain publicly recorded documents regarding the property jim fieber learned that the property — principally because it was covered by extensive wetlands — did not have the shopping center development potential the fiebers had counted on as a consequence the fiebers decided to bring in other investors to reduce the risk tr   even though norman fieber was hmgs fiduciary the fiebers did not inform their joint venture partner hmg that they now viewed the development potential of wallingford as compromised tr  the fiebers tell a similar story regarding their decision to bring investors into the naf transaction after the late april agreementinprinciple the fiebers undertook a due diligence review of the appraisals and conducted site inspections upon doing so they concluded that the grossmans portfolio was a much riskier investment than they had initially thought therefore they again decided to limit their risk by taking in other investors tr   again the fiebers did not inform hmg that they viewed the development potential of the portfolio as less attractive than they originally thought tr  the fiebers contend that they had no intention to include martine as one of the investors in naf until after the wallingford transaction closed rather their intention as to naf was to split their  stake on an equal basis with stephen hoffman another connecticut developer with whom they had invested in the past in early may  hoffman considered undertaking such an investment but ultimately decided against it tr  thereafter milton mann another real estate investor also turned the fiebers down tr   only once these events occurred the fiebers say did they turn to the investors who ultimately became their partners in the naf transaction these investors who came together to form the partnership  known as naf associates included norman fieber jim fieber howard lerner auburn investors ltd jay kaplan melvan kaplan sheila marin stanley fieber and martine after considering the evidence bearing on this question i conclude that the fiebers knew that they would probably utilize coinvestors from the time they began discussing the wallingford and naf transactions with hmg although they may not have been certain about that they were inclined toward and open to that prospect throughout the course of their negotiations of the transactions equally important i find that to the extent that norman fieber was inclined to utilize coinvestors he was also inclined to include gray among their number several factors lead me to this conclusion first norman fieber used coinvestors on a regular basis in particular norman fieber would include coinvestors with whom he had a close and trusting business relationship given his style of business he was not likely to exclude such investors if they were willing and capable of participating second norman fieber was clearly considering coinvestors as early as february  including howard lerner a regular fieber coinvestor who ended up as an investor in the wallingford and naf transactions px a see also tr  third norman fieber while a man of some means was not so wealthy that he was likely to invest well over  million of his own money in one project in fact in december  norman fieber had received  from gray so as to cut fiebers previous  investment in a project in half because fieber needed somebody to help him because he was involved in too many other things tr  px  finally i believe that once norman fieber decided to take in investors on wallingford he became virtually certain to do so with regard to the naf transaction to the extent that the fiebers desired to reduce risk on an investment of only  it is difficult for me to conceive that they would not also seek to do so with regard to an investment ten times that amount nor am i persuaded by norman fiebers contention that in early may  he did not intend to take investors other than stephen hoffman into naf although i do not disbelieve hoffmans testimony that he was offered  of the fiebers share that testimony is not inconsistent with the prospect that the fiebers would take in other investors and reduce their overall percentage even further tr  given the fiebers intent to charge a management fee such a reduced percentage still gave them a healthy incentive to participate moreover a decision to eschew other investors and cut out longtime coinvestors like gray and lerner seems out of keeping with norman fiebers way of doing business in so concluding i do not find that norman fieber definitely intended to include gray through martine as a coinvestor in the wallingford and naf transactions i do find that while norman fieber was negotiating the transactions with gray he knew it was likely that he would take in coinvestors and that to the extent that eventuality came to pass that gray would be invited to participate j gray conceals his interest in the transactions from the hmg executive committee on june   the executive committee of the hmg board met to consider whether to ratify the wallingford transaction gray attended in his capacity as a member of the executive committee despite the fact that martine had taken a buyside interest in the wallingford transaction gray voted to ratify the transaction he did not disclose martines interest in the transaction tr  k gray and fieber mislead hmg about the identity of the naf associates in preparation for closing the naf transaction hmg requested a copy of the  naf partnership agreement so that it could among other things learn the identity of the fiebers coinvestors tr  the fiebers sent a copy of the agreement to hmg the copy sent to hmg identified each of the partners in naf including martine however the agreement indicated martines address as being located at  fox ridge road stamford connecticut  px  that address is norman fiebers home address a location with no proper connection to martine the address accorded with hmgs understanding that fiebers coinvestors were friends and members of his family tr   the use of norman fiebers address on the partnership agreement was i am certain not inadvertent an earlier draft of the partnership agreement listed martines address at grays office in larchmont new york a proper address px  the only question is whether gray is solely responsible for the change or whether the fiebers conspired with him to change the agreement the fiebers point the finger directly at gray and claim to have no direct knowledge of how the address was changed in support of this contention the fiebers point to handwritten notes of jim fieber that he made while attempting to compile information from the prospective naf partners so as to complete the partnership agreement with respect to martine jim fiebers notes state martine avenue associates partner betsy robbinslg mother send co lgs address in larchmont per lg dx  tr  they assert that between the time of the original draft partnership agreement which had the correct address and the time that the final draft was prepared using norman fiebers address it is likely that gray called the fiebers office and asked a member of the clerical staff to change the address tr  in support of this contention they cite grays habit of contacting the fiebers clerical staff about other matters for his part gray says he does not know how martines address came to be identified as norman fiebers home tr  at trial he said ive been racking my brain  i have no idea i never saw that agreement id as if the address mystery were not enough the process by which martine executed the partnership agreement is also highly suspect shortly before closing hmgs outside counsel asked jim fieber for an executed copy of the partnership agreement according to jim fieber he called gray to ask for a copy executed on martines behalf gray jim fieber contends said he was not a partner in martine and could not sign gray therefore suggested that jim fieber sign on martines behalf jim fieber replied that he could not do so without a partners authorization gray responded by saying that he could not sign the authorization but that he would arrange to have his sister saffell send a letter authorizing jim fieber to sign the agreement on martines behalf tr   in a letter dated july   saffell wrote to jim fieber stating this is authorization for you to act as our trustee for martine avenue associates in the partnership naf associates i am a general partner in martine avenue associates and am authorized to grant you this power px  after receiving this letter jim fieber executed the partnership agreement on martines behalf tr  both of the fiebers claim to have placed no significance on any of these events or on the addresses in the partnership agreement they say they were small businessmen concentrating on getting a deal done and nonmaterial details such as addresses or how authorizations were obtained simply  did not capture their attention tr   jim fieber now recognizes that it would have been much more efficient to have had saffell execute the partnership agreement and send it to him than for him to have sent her a letter received a letter in return and executed the partnership agreement himself tr  he contends that he did not think about that at the time because he was focussed on closing the deal id grays version of how his sister came to send an authorization letter to jim fieber directly contradicts jim fiebers testimony according to gray jim fieber called him and asked for a letter from grays sister authorizing fieber to sign the partnership agreement on behalf of martine tr  jim fieber then dictated the authorization letter to grays secretary and that letter was then sent to saffell who signed it and returned it to jim fieber tr  gray denies telling jim fieber that he was not a partner in martine tr  like the fiebers gray cannot explain why the most efficient course gray signing the agreement or the second most efficient course saffell signing the agreement was not chosen except to argue that the way he and jim fieber did it was somehow simpler tr  it is of course impossible for me to determine with any degree of certainty exactly how the address in the partnership agreement came to be changed and who made the decision to have jim fieber execute the partnership agreement on martines behalf i do conclude with certainty that gray helped bring about the change in address so as to conceal his interest in martine from hmg i also believe that gray helped cause the execution of the agreement through jim fieber for an identical reason with less certainty i also conclude that the fiebers knew about the address change at the time and sent a naf partnership agreement to hmg knowing it contained a false address for martine jim fieber appeared to be a credible witness at trial but i am deeply troubled by the fact that at trial he admitted to being the principal draftsman of the partnership agreement yet in his deposition had no recollection at all of how that agreement came to be prepared compare tr  with j fieber  at trial jim fieber also admitted to being involved in other changes to the agreement eg tr  and in his deposition admitted to knowing that another partners address was changed from norman fiebers home in the earlier draft to its proper business address in the final draft j fieber  yet he claims to have no knowledge of how or why martines address was changed in the opposite direction — from a correct address to norman fiebers home i am also dubious about the fiebers assertion that a member of their support staff would insert norman fiebers home address in a contract without their permission although i can imagine that gray could be quite influential with a member of the fiebers support staff given his documented communication style i would think that the member would have checked to see if what gray had wanted was okay with norman or jim fieber a request by even a regular investor like gray to use norman fiebers address is not one likely to be granted by a clerical employee without authorization from a superior  i have even greater doubt that the fiebers did not know it was fishy that gray wanted jim fieber to execute the naf partnership agreement the naf transaction was not the first time that norman fieber had dealt with martine through gray and it was not to be the last yet this is the only occasion in which the fiebers did not proceed with martine solely utilizing grays authorization at best the fiebers appear to have purposely closed their eyes and held their noses and went along with whatever gray asked without inquiring why gray wished to proceed in the manner he did at worst they knew exactly why — it was after all quite obvious — gray wanted to have jim fieber sign and agreed to that request l the naf transaction closes on july   the naf transaction closed hmg and the fiebers agreed that the joint venture was to be governed by a board comprised of two representatives from hmg and two representatives from naf on july   naf associates had been created to accomplish the naf transaction that day martine invested  in naf and became its first investor px  tr  as a result martine acquired a  stake in naf m gray and fieber fail to disclose martines interest to hmgs board of directors on august   the hmg board met to consider whether to ratify the wallingford and naf transactions both gray and fieber attended the meeting in their capacity as directors neither disclosed martines interest in the transactions norman fieber claims that he knew that martine was owned by grays family tr  but did not think about disclosing that fact tr   gray contends that as he looks back he made a conscious decision not to disclose his interest because in his judgment his interest in the transactions was immaterial tr  norman fieber did abstain from voting on the transactions because of his own personal interest tr  gray did not abstain and voted to ratify them n fieber receives postclosing evidence of grays partnership interest in martine norman fieber claims that from  until  he had no knowledge that gray was a partner and owner of martine he asserts this claim in the face of a great deal of evidence suggesting that he was well aware that gray was a partner in martine see eg tr  the totality of the evidence regarding fiebers and grays business interactions is far too abundant to describe in detail suffice to say that martine through gray invested in six major projects with fieber over an eighteen year period in connection with these investments fieber never dealt with any representative of martine other than gray tr  indeed he never met grays sister saffell until the trial occurred tr  gray was no quiet passive investor he made his views known to fieber on a regular basis and watched over every dime of martines investments with care perhaps the most compelling piece of evidence regarding fiebers knowledge of grays status as a partner and owner of martine is a letter sent to fieber in connection with fiebers own investment of  in martine this investment was made in november  and apparently gave fieber a stake in a farm martine had purchased in millerton new york on  november   gray sent fieber a letter acknowledging receipt of the  on behalf of martine and signed his name as partner of that partnership px  see also tr  fieber contends that he took no notice of this letter he takes the same position as to another limited partnership agreement he executed that lists gray as a general partner of martine px  similarly he sloughs off numerous other documents sent to him by gray in these documents gray clearly signals his personal interest in martine for example gray battled with fieber about the management fees the fiebers charged the naf partners in connection with that dispute gray wrote several heated notes to fieber indicating statements such as i just want out send me my  send my  of each check directly to me and i have a better idea — ill withdraw px  at norm see also px  note regarding lambert investment involving fieber and gray and describing relevant investment as our lambert al lg  nf nor fieber says did he take note of the fact that gray personally guaranteed large loans regarding investments in which martine was the investor see eg px  personal guarantee of  million loan for lambert investment gray made with fieber through martine gray executed one such guarantee in connection with a loan naf itself took from union trust in  see px  see also px  that year naf took out a  loan at grays strong urging px    the loan proceeds were immediately paid out to the partners including martine the fiebers through a letter from jim fieber required each of the naf partners to sign the note to union trust px  gray executed the note on behalf of martine signing on the same page as norman and jim fieber px  given the constant contact between fieber and gray the abundant evidence of grays personal concern about the investments and the direct evidence that fieber saw documents indicating that gray was a partner of martine i do not believe that fieber was ignorant of grays ownership interest in martine certainly by the end of  he knew of that interest and to the extent that fieber blinded himself to the fact that gray had an ownership interest in martine fieber certainly knew that grays interest in martines health and success was equal to or greater than the concern gray would have had for an investment gray held personally bolstering my view in these regards is the curious role of jim fieber in  jim fieber supposedly had to get a letter from grays sister to execute the naf partnership agreement on behalf of martine but by  jim fieber was sending gray letters addressed to dear partner and asking gray to personally sign a  note on behalf of martine px   how come didnt this ring any bells why didnt jim fieber say hey dad how come lee gray can sign this year and he couldnt last year although jim fieber was putting his short legal career behind for a career in real estate it is hard for me to believe that an intelligent young lawyer fresh out of a respected law firm would not be troubled by this apparent inconsistency  despite the abundant evidence they possessed of grays economic interest in martine neither of the fiebers did anything to bring grays interest to the attention of the hmg board o gray and fieber file false disclosures with the hmg board that result in misdisclosures to hmgs public shareholders each year hmg asks its directors to fill out a disclosure document designed in large measure to identify possible conflicts of interest and to help the company meet its disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws the disclosure questionnaire states in particular that please report all transactions with the company whether or not you consider them to be material

wallingford and naf transactions see eg dx   questionnaire response he did so despite possessing clear evidence as of november   that martine was owned by gray as well as members of grays family gray also filled out such questionnaires annually during this period none of which disclosed martines interest in the transactions gray and fieber also signed the companys ks during these years all of which  failed to disclose martines interest in the transactions p the joint ventures turn handsome profits but not in the way originally contemplated by the joint venturers one of the few things that hmg and the defendants agreed upon at trial was that the original intention of hmg and the fiebers was to redevelop the wallingford property and at least some of the grossmans portfolio as properties came off lease from the grossmans stores as events turned out that is not what happened over the course of the succeeding decade many of the properties came off lease yet none of them was redeveloped instead the properties were sold at prices generally well in excess of the fee simple values contained in the  appraisals while hmg made an effort at trial to show that the lack of redevelopment efforts was caused by gray and fieber i am persuaded that hmg through wiener principally and norman fieber jointly decided to sell properties rather than to redevelop them since the venturers made handsome profits in this less risky manner their decision was at the very least rational although the lack of redevelopment meant that one of the primary assets the fiebers brought to the transactions has been to date little utilized — their development ability — there is no evidence that hmg pressed or even encouraged the fiebers to redevelop rather than sell properties in fact several of the documents hmg cites as demonstrating that gray wished to maximize current returns through sales are copied to wiener and rothstein and implicitly indicate the advisers collective interest in such an approach px   the only witness who persuaded me at all that he was eagerly interested in redeveloping rather than selling some of the properties was jim fieber the other players seemed content to reap the rewards of appreciation in the portfolios value through favorable sales transactions by october  the joint venture had sold wallingford and  of the  properties included in the naf transaction the transactions produced returns  higher than the leased fee values for the properties as set forth in the  appraisals px  also reflecting  higher return than fee simple values the sale of the wallingford property resulted in distributions of  to fiebers wallingford investors as compared to their  cost of investment the naf partners received  as a result of the portfolio sales as compared to their  cost of investment substantial future profits to the naf partners are still expected from the remaining properties in the portfolio the annualized returns produced by the joint venture far outstripped the performance of the commercial real estate market during the same time period px a at  q hmgs board discovers martines interest it was not until october of  that wiener and rothstein first learned of grays interest in the naf transaction during september  the joint ventures real estate administrator lavin inquired about the identity of the individual partners of naf for maine state tax withholding purposes in connection with a property sale as a result of that inquiry  lavin learned that gray and saffell were martines partners after discovering this lavin informed rothstein and wiener thereafter gray confirmed his interest in naf to wiener tr  on november   the hmg board met and was informed of grays interest the board authorized an investigation into the matter during that investigation hmg learned that martine also had an interest in the wallingford transaction shortly thereafter gray dissolved martine without disclosure to hmg at the end of its investigation the board concluded that gray and fieber had breached their fiduciary duties and should leave the hmg board and that gray should resign his management position with hmg in addition the advisers contract was terminated and hmg contracted with a new entity for advice that entity was identical to the adviser but was not owned or affiliated in any way with gray instead wiener controlled that entity tr  on july   hmg commenced this litigation ii analysis of hmgs claims hmg brings three major claims as to defendants gray and norman fieber hmg claims that they breached their fiduciary duties and defrauded the company as to defendant saffell hmg claims that she is liable as an aider and abettor of defendant gray and as a former partner in the now dissolved martine i will address each of these claims beginning with the fiduciary duty claims a breach of fiduciary duty  the appropriate burden of proof hmg contends that gray and norman fieber engaged in selfdealing and therefore they bear the burden to demonstrate the entire fairness of the transactions for his part fieber claims that grays interest in the transactions was immaterial and therefore the hmg boards decision to ratify the transactions was a proper exercise of discretion subject to protection by the business judgment rule gray concedes that the defendants had the initial burden to demonstrate fairness and claims that they have done so without rebuttal from hmg gray posttrial br at  both hmg and fieber initially focussed their attention on the business judgment rule with much less emphasis on  del c §  but this case directly implicates both the business judgment rule and §  even though the business judgment rule and §  serve somewhat different purposes and cannot be interpreted identically they are closely related therefore in two important decisions in a case where the statute was not literally implicated the delaware supreme court stressed the relevance of §  and attempted to conform its application of the business judgment rule to adhere to the statutes core concerns cinerama inc v technicolor inc delsupr  ad    subsequent history omitted cede  co v technicolor inc cede ii delsupr  ad    subsequent history omitted  respect for that teaching and for the general assembly dictates that in a case where §  is directly applicable compliance with its terms should be a minimum requirement to retain the protection of the business judgment rule cede ii  ad at  n  satisfaction of one of § a  or  permits an otherwise interested transaction to be brought within the protection of the business judgment rule the desirability of doctrinal and statutory coherence where that can be accomplished without sacrificing public policy interests also counsels that conclusion in this case both the business judgment rule as traditionally interpreted and §  point toward the entire fairness standard as the appropriate form of review as a procedural guide the business judgment presumption is a rule of evidence that places the initial burden of proof on the plaintiff cinerama del supr  ad at  emphasis omitted fieber contends that my burden shifting analysis must focus on the standard articulated in cinerama and cede ii to address situations where a director has an indirect or incidental interest in a transaction with the corporation that standard requires a plaintiff wishing to rebut the presumption of the business judgment rule to produce evidence that a director had a nondisclosed material interest in the challenged transaction and a reasonable director would have regarded the existence of the material interest as a significant fact in the evaluation of the proposed transaction id at  quoting cinerama inc v technicolor inc del ch  ad    see also cede ii  ad at  fieber argues that grays percentage interest in the overall transactions was so minimal that grays interest does not rise to the level of a material interest that would have been considered significant by a reasonable disinterested director in voting on the transactions this contention misconceives the appropriate legal standard as cinerama and cede ii themselves demonstrate grays interest in the wallingford and naf transactions implicates both the primary rationale for the entire fairness standard of review and the core concern of §  — selfdealing cinerama delsupr  ad at  in cinerama the supreme court described selfdealing as existing when a director deals directly with the corporation or has a stake in or is an officer or director of a firm that deals with the corporation id at  citing  delc § a traditionally the term selfdealing describes the situation when a corporate fiduciary is on both sides of a transaction  id quoting sinclair oil corp v levien del supr  ad    in cede ii the supreme court affirmed chancellor allens holding that absent evidence of selfdealing  evidence of any personal or special benefit accruing to a director  in an otherwise armslength transaction does not establish a lack of independence sufficient to rebut the business judgment rule unless the directors selfinterest is also found to be material cede ii  ad at  emphasis added in so ruling the court noted that the chancellor had concluded that a plaintiffs burden of proof of a directors selfinterest in an armslength third party transaction should be greater than in a classic selfdealing  transaction where a director or directors stand on both sides of a transaction id emphasis added see also cede ii  ad at  provided that the terms of  delc §  are met selfinterest alone is not a disqualifying factor even for a director cinerama del supr  ad at  in cede ii this court distinguished classic selfdealing from incidental director interest to be disqualifying the nature of the director interest must be substantial grays undisclosed buyside interest in the transactions is a classic case of selfdealing under cede ii and cinerama proof of such undisclosed selfdealing in itself is sufficient to rebut the presumption of the business judgment rule and invoke entire fairness review see also  david a drexler et al delaware corporation law and practice §  at   indicating that where classic selfdealing exists the business judgment rule automatically falls by the wayside section  of the delaware general corporation law dictates this conclusion that statute is implicated whenever a corporation and  or more of its directors or officers  or partnership  or other organization in which  or more of its directors or officers  have a financial interest engage in a transaction  del c §  the interests of gray and fieber in the wallingford and naf transactions trigger the statute section  provides that a selfdealing transaction will not be void or voidable solely for this reason if the transaction is ratified by a majority of the disinterested directors or by a shareholder vote  delc § a  such ratification is valid however only if the material facts as to the directors relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the relevant ratifying authority id neither fieber nor gray disclosed grays interest in the transactions to the hmg board id in the absence of such disclosure  delc § a the transactions can only be rendered nonvoidable if they were fair as to hmg as of the time they were authorized  delc § a see also cede ii  ad at  n  under § a a nondisclosing interested director can remove the taint of interestedness by proving the entire fairness of the challenged transaction  r franklin balotti  jesse a finkelstein the delaware law of corporations  business organizations §  at  d ed same furthermore even if the cinerama test to determine whether an incidental director interest rose to the level of materiality were applicable grays interest satisfies it cinerama delsupr  ad at  gray invested  of his and his sisters money in the transactions his keen interest in maximizing distributions from the joint venture belies any contention that this investment was not substantial and of material importance to him id since gray anticipated taking a buyside interest in the transactions at least as early as february  and was hmgs lead negotiator in the transactions a reasonable director would have  certainly wanted to know about his buyside position in the transactions see mills acquisition co v macmillan inc macmillan ii delsupr  ad    where disinterested majority was manipulated by a deceptive ceo entire fairness was appropriate standard of review indeed one of the outside directors who voted to ratify the transactions testified that he would not have done so had he been aware of grays buyside interest tr  wiener gave similar testimony tr  while i do not base my finding solely on this testimony i found the testimony of these directors particularly outside director walter arader a man with extensive experience in matters of corporate governance and a record of distinguished public service to be credible and to accord with common sense cf kendall v state delsupr  ad    relying on testimony that homebuyers would not have purchased homes from a criminal defendant if the defendant had disclosed his prior misconduct to them in affirming criminal conviction it supports my conclusion that any reasonable director would want to know about a buyside interest on the part of a corporate officer and director who acted as a negotiator for the corporation in sales transactions in which the corporation was the seller the proposition seems almost too obvious to need stating for all these reasons gray and fieber must demonstrate the fairness of the wallingford and naf transactions  the entire fairness standard in a recent case vice chancellor lamb wellsummarized the entire fairness standard of review as follows it is a wellsettled principle of delaware law that where directors stand on both sides of a transaction they have the burden of establishing its entire fairness sufficient to pass the test of careful scrutiny by the courts weinberger v uop inc delsupr  ad    there is no safe harbor for such divided loyalties in delaware directors will be found to have acted with entire fairness where they demonstrate their utmost good faith and the most scrupulous inherent fairness of the bargain id       the concept of entire fairness has two components fair dealing and fair price see weinberger delsupr  ad at  fair dealing embraces questions of when the transaction was timed how it was initiated structured negotiated disclosed to the directors and how the approvals of the directors and the stockholders were obtained id fair price relates to the economic and financial considerations of the proposed merger including all relevant factors assets market value earnings future prospects and any other elements that affect the intrinsic or inherent value of a companys stock id in making a determination as to the entire fairness of a transaction the court does not focus on one component over the other but examines all aspects of the issue as a whole id boyer v wilmington materials inc del ch ca no  mem op at  lamb vc  wl  jan   emphasis added i fair dealing the defendants have failed to convince me that the wallingford and naf transactions were fairly negotiated or ratified from the beginning of the negotiations gray the primary negotiator for the seller in the transactions was interested  in taking a position on the buyers side as such gray lacked the pure sellerside incentive that should have been applied on behalf of hmg — particularly in transactions in which one director was already on the other side given the intrinsically unique nature of real estate the bargaining skills and incentives of hmgs negotiator were likely to be more important than if the negotiator was arranging for the sale of a financial asset as the defendants own expert conceded in the context of a real estate sales transaction negotiation skills are exceedingly important tr  gray took the lead in discussing these transactions with the fiebers his colleagues wiener and rothstein relied on his depiction of the bargaining in determining whether to agree to the fiebers proposed terms they did so in ignorance of grays conflict similarly hmgs executive committee and board were deprived of information about grays conflict the process was thus anything but fair because neither gray nor fieber disclosed grays interest the hmg board unwittingly ratified transactions in which a conflicted negotiator was relied upon by the adviser to negotiate already conflicted transactions cf cinerama delsupr  ad at  the independence of the bargaining parties is a wellrecognized touchstone of fair dealing ii fair price the defendants attempt to meet their burden of demonstrating fair price by trying to convince me that the prices used in the transactions were in a range of fairness as proven by the  appraisals in addition they cite to portions of hmgs own ks which continue to report that the transactions were conducted on terms tied to appraisals and as favorable as if they had been done at armslength with an unrelated purchaser once again i believe the defendants misconceive their burden on the record before me i obviously cannot conclude that hmg received a shockingly low price in the transactions or that the prices paid were not within the low end of the range of possible prices that might have been paid in negotiated armslength deals in that narrow sense the defendants have proven that the price was fair but that proof does not necessarily satisfy their burden under the entire fairness standard as the american law institute corporate governance principles point out a contract price might be fair in the sense that it corresponds to market  price and yet the corporation might have refused to make the contract if a given material fact had been disclosed furthermore fairness is often a range rather than a point so that a transaction involving a payment by the corporation may be fair even though it is consummated at the high end of the range if an undisclosed material fact had been disclosed however the corporation might have declined to transact at that high price or might have bargained the price down lower in the range  principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations part v at   emphasis added but see cinerama inc v technicolor inc delch  ad    subsequent history omitted at least in the nonselfdealing context price within a range of values a reasonable seller would accept is fair emphasis added the defendants have failed to persuade me that hmg would not have gotten a materially higher value for wallingford and the grossmans portfolio had gray and fieber come clean about grays interest that is they have not convinced me that their misconduct did not taint the price to hmgs disadvantage i base this conclusion on several factors first the defendants own expert on value james nolan testified that his opinion that the prices paid in the transactions were fair was premised on his assumption that gray was not the leading negotiator from hmgs side to the extent that gray was a principal player in discussing terms with fieber nolan said that his conclusion about the fairness of the price might well be different tr  second the  appraisals understated the values of the wallingford property and the portfolio as of early  the leased fee values in the  appraisals were generated through a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing  actual rents and projected rents for  by  it was clear that the grossmans stores operating at portfolio sites were performing better and thereby generating higher lease payments because a portion of the lease payments was tied to store sales than estimated by the appraisers who conducted the  appraisals px   lavin  if an update had been done in  it would have produced values well in excess of the  appraisals this conclusion is bolstered by appraisals done on six of the portfolio properties in  at the request of chemical bank which selected the properties to be appraised the  appraisals indicated values  higher than the leased fee values in the  appraisals px  also indicating a  increase in the fee simple values tr  lavin   third a skilled and properly motivated negotiator could have done better than leased fee value in price negotiations as the defendants expert nolan testified the skills of a negotiator are exceedingly important in a real estate transaction tr  even without an updated appraisal a properly motivated negotiator could have argued from the actual rents in  and  that the leased fee value understated the value of the portfolio furthermore a properly motivated negotiator would have focussed on the fee simple value because of the likelihood that many of the portfolio properties would come off lease from grossmans that eventuality — which came true — justified a higher price than the leased fee value i have no confidence that gray negotiated with the fiebers in any vigorous or skillful way since he wanted to participate on the buyside he had less than a satisfactory incentive to do so since the outcome of a real estate negotiation is often heavily influenced by the skills of the negotiators this factor undercuts the claim that the price was fair to hmg see  principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations §  at   in evaluating the fairness of a transaction the court should consider the fact that the corporation was not represented by an unconflicted negotiator finally had gray disclosed his interest i believe that hmg would have terminated his involvement in the negotiations and have taken a much more traditional approach to selling the affected properties tr  to the extent that hmg continued to consider a sales transaction i believe it would have commissioned new appraisals and would have sought purchasers other than fieber this would have been in keeping with the recommendations of lavins january  memorandum suggesting rejection of the  thirdparty offer for wallingford px a such an approach would have led to a sales transaction at a level more akin to the fee simple value in the  appraisals than the leased fee value cf cede ii  ad at  where directors sell the company they must establish that the price offered was the highest value reasonably available under the circumstances taken together these factors lead me to conclude that the defendants have not demonstrated that they paid a fair price in the sense inherent in the entire fairness standard see cinerama delch  ad at  the judgment concerning fairness will inevitably constitute a judicial judgment that in some respects is reflective of subjective reactions to the facts of a case fairness simply is not a term with an objective referent or clear single meaning therefore gray and fieber have failed to establish to my satisfaction that the transactions were the product of both fair dealing and fair price cinerama delsupr  ad at  quotations  citations omitted emphasis added b fraud to prevail on its claim of fraud against gray and norman fieber hmg must prove  deliberate concealment by gray and fieber of a material past or present fact or silence in the face of a duty to speak  that gray and fieber acted with scienter  an intent to induce hmgs reliance upon the concealment  causation and  damages resulting from the concealment  nicolet inc v nutt delsupr  ad    stephenson v capano dev inc delsupr  ad    equitable fraud has the same elements but there is no scienter requirement zirn v vli corp delsupr  ad    as directors of hmg gray and fieber had an unremitting obligation to deal candidly with their fellow directors macmillan ii  ad at  this obligation required them to take affirmative steps to disclose grays interest id see also  principles of corporate governance analysis  recommendations §  at   interested director must affirmatively disclose the material facts known to the director and explain the implications of a transaction applying these standards i have no hesitance in finding that gray deliberately concealed his personal interest in the transactions and was silent in the face of a duty to disclose that interest to his fellow hmg directors acted with the requisite scienter intended for the hmg board to rely on his concealment in approving the transactions caused the hmg board to approve the transactions when they would not have done so had he made the appropriate disclosures damaged hmg by thereby facilitating the transactions at prices substantially less than hmg would have obtained had the affected properties been sold through a different process as such he is liable to hmg for fraud macmillan ii  ad at  where directors silence was misleading and deceptive they committed a fraud on the board furthermore grays fraudulent concealment continued for ten years after  i reach the same conclusion with regard to norman fieber with only slightly more hesitation as to whether he acted with scienter although gray is more culpable than norman fieber norman fiebers selfportrayal as a babe in the business woods is not convincing to me fieber is a successful and savvy man at the time the hmg board of directors ratified the transactions fieber admittedly knew that members of grays family owned martine as a director of hmg who was a proponent of the transactions fieber had a duty to disclose what he knew about martine even if gray did not in this regard i profess that i cannot grasp the enormous significance fieber places on the fact that he thought that grays family rather than gray personally owned martine fieber is a man who says he has often represented members of his family in financial transactions tr   when he does so i have no doubt that fieber attempts to protect his family members financial interests no less avidly than he attempts to protect his own nor do i have any doubt that fieber believed that gray was equally protective of his own mother and sister the members of grays family the fiebers say they thought owned martine tr  fieber therefore knew that gray had an interest in ensuring that the price paid by martine was favorable to members of grays family fieber possessed knowledge that gray had a conflicted interest in the transactions since this buyside interest was adverse to hmgs sellside interest he had a duty to disclose his knowledge if it is true that gray told fieber in february  that martine could invest in the transactions but that gray could not invest personally that conversation alone would have set off a fire alarm in the mind of a reasonable director at that stage fieber should have brought the issue to the attention of the boards chairman wiener if not to all of his fellow directors  instead fieber continued to negotiate these important transactions with gray knowing that grays family partnership wanted to participate on the buyside of the deals fiebers contention that he never thought he had to disclose his knowledge of the interest of grays family is unbelievable i think he took his cue from gray and purposely kept quiet so that the transactions would be ratified fiebers postratification silence also constituted fraud no later than november  fieber received clear notice that gray was a partner in martine px  at that time he could have partially rectified his earlier failure to speak by bringing grays partnership status to the attention of the hmg board this he failed to do nor did he bring grays partnership status to the attention of the hmg board when he received additional evidence of grays status fieber answered questionnaires every year in which he claimed to have no knowledge of transactions between hmg and gray fiebers claim that he did not disclose grays interest at the august  board meeting because he then believed that martine was owned by grays family cannot excuse his later failure to disclose martine in response to company questionnaires clearly requiring such disclosure nor do i find persuasive fiebers claim that he was confused by the questionnaires norman fieber is a sophisticated man who can read the english language the questionnaires are not that difficult to read a properly motivated fiduciary would err on the side of overdisclosure not underdisclosure in this respect i find significant the absence of any evidence that fieber called up company counsel and said you know im not sure but i think lee gray might be a partner in martine since i got a letter from him that says so in any case i know for sure that members of lee grays family own martine and martine has a stake in the wallingford and naf transactions is that the kind of thing that i need to put down under question a it is frankly hard for me to swallow a defense implicitly premised on the assertion that a director and member of the audit committee of a public company took lightly questionnaires the company required in connection with preparing disclosures under the federal securities laws c aiding and abetting to prevail on its claim that saffell aided and abetted grays breach of fiduciary duty hmg must show  the existence of a fiduciary relationship  a breach of the fiduciarys duty  knowing participation by the nonfiduciary in that breach and  resulting damages in re santa fe pac corp shareholder litig delsupr  ad    since gray was an hmg fiduciary breached his duty and caused resulting damages the only element in question is whether saffell knowingly participated in that breach saffell played a major role in concealing grays ownership interest in martine from hmg by authorizing jim fieber to sign the naf partnership agreement she obviated the need for either herself or gray to sign the agreement had either done so the chances that hmg would have learned that the two of them owned martine would have increased exponentially saffell testified that she essentially entrusted her business affairs to her brother gray who had taken care of her finances since she was widowed early in her adult life i found her testimony to be credible and believe that she would have been likely to assent to any reasonable request made to her by gray in connection with martine this is not to say that saffell was a helpless ingenue there is no doubt that saffell knew that martine was investing in the naf transaction and that it was a substantial investment px a nor was it typical for saffell to be asked by gray to sign anything on behalf of martine  much less an authorization allowing another person to act as martines agent i am sure that saffell an intelligent person who had a career as a school teacher realized something odd was up even so hmg has not persuaded me that saffell authorized jim fieber to sign that agreement with the knowledge that by doing so she was assisting her brother in covering up their ownership interest in martine as such she is not liable as an aider and abettor see carlton invs v tlc beatrice intl holdings inc del ch ca no   wl  at   n  allen c nov   aiding and abetting claim must be supported by proof of an understanding between the parties with respect to their complicity in any scheme to defraud or in any breach of fiduciary duties the fact that saffell was not an aider and abettor does not however insulate her from being responsible to hmg for recompense saffells liability is justifiable on at least two independent grounds as a former general partner in martine saffell is liable for the authorized acts of her brother on behalf of the partnership restatement second of agency § a cmt a  under new york law which governed martine saffell is liable even if she had no knowledge of her brothers wrongdoing clients sec fund of state of new york v grandeau  nyd   nysd   ned    see also a ny jur business relationships §   saffell is also properly held accountable because she was unjustly enriched at hmgs expense although she herself may have been innocent her agent gray was not and wrongfully obtained profits for martine at the expense of hmg it is appropriate to require saffell to make restitution even if she was not a wrongdoer since it would be unconscionable to allow her to benefit from her agents wrongful activity on her behalf schock v nash delsupr  ad    d fiebers  delc § b defense before discussing the appropriate remedy i must address norman fiebers claim that he at most breached the duty of care he owed to hmg and therefore that he is insulated under the relevant provision of hmgs certificate of incorporation which tracks  delc § b for at least two reasons this defense fails first § b does not allow certificate provisions to eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when such provision becomes effective as fieber belatedly concedes the relevant hmg certificate provision was not effective until august   after the major acts upon which fiebers liability hinges occurred dx  second fiebers concealment of the facts about martine implicates his duty of loyalty not just his duty of care fieber knew that he was negotiating already conflicted transactions yet he chose to negotiate those transactions with a fellow director who desired to participate with him on the buyside of the deals thereafter fieber invited that directors participation on the buyside having done so fieber continued to conceal that directors interest in the transactions this conduct was not the product of mere inadvertence but a conscious decision by fieber not to come clean with the board  iii what is the appropriate remedy a damages and injunctive relief as one would expect the parties part ways on the nature of the remedy that should be awarded hmg argues that gray and fieber have behaved so improperly that an award of rescissory damages should be made that requires gray and fieber to restore to hmg the profits earned by all of the buyside investors in both transactions hmg urges such a remedy because rescission itself is not a practical remedy since several of the fieberside investors in the transactions are not parties to this action hmg also wants me to order gray and fieber to disgorge their remaining ownership interests in the joint venture and to impose a constructive trust on the remaining assets of the joint venture to the extent that gray and fieber cannot cause the nonparty naf investors to transfer their ownership interests in the joint venture to hmg hmg seeks to hold gray and fieber jointly and severally liable to pay their future share of the profits to hmg for their part gray and fieber argue that no harm to hmg occurred at all realizing that i might find otherwise they argue alternatively that a judgment requiring gray and fieber to pay complete rescissory damages to disgorge their remaining ownership interests in the joint venture and to be accountable for their coinvestors future profits is too harsh an award given the circumstances i have given a great deal of thought to the appropriate remedy there is no doubt that gray and fieber committed serious breaches of duty and that the remedy sought by hmg is permissible in these circumstances ryan v tads enter inc delch  ad   affd delsupr  ad   an award of rescissory damages would be most appropriate where it is shown that the defendant fiduciaries unjustly enriched themselves by exercising their fiduciary authority deliberately to extract a personal financial benefit at the expense of the corporations shareholders i am mindful of the need to tailor a remedy that holds them accountable for those breaches and that does not set a precedent that encourages behavior of this sort by other directors of delaware companies delaware law dictates that the scope of recovery for a breach of the duty of loyalty is not to be determined narrowly thorpe v cerbco inc delsupr  ad    on the other hand it is likely that hmg would have sold a percentage interest in the grossmans portfolio to a buyer other than fieber sometime in  or  if it had not sold such an interest to fieber the evidence persuades me that hmg was looking to generate cash and the portfolio was a prime candidate in that regard had hmg sold a percentage interest in the portfolio at that time it would have sought a price near the fee simple value in the  appraisals and would have been quite happy to receive such a price therefore if i order gray and fieber to return all the profits earned by the buyside members of the joint venture i will be putting hmg in a position much better than i think it would be in now had the transactions never occurred i will also be requiring gray and fieber who are affluent but not without resource limits to pay a judgment that seems out of proportion to the harm they caused i do not think such an award is equitable instead i have crafted a remedy tailored to the specific facts of this case in so doing i have done my best to craft from the panoply of equitable remedies a damage award that approximates a price and terms the hmg board would have  approved absent a breach of duty ryan  ad at  several principles guide me in shaping this remedy first i think it is likely that hmg would have obtained a price at the fee simple value had the transactions been negotiated on an armslength basis second gray should never have had any ownership interest on the buyside of the transactions third i think that hmg would have been able to sell somewhat less than the percentage interest it sold to the fieberside investors in the naf transaction had that transaction been negotiated on an armslength basis finally it is inequitable to permit norman fieber to continue to exercise coequal control over the joint venture in keeping with the first principle gray and fieber will be held jointly and severally liable to pay hmg the difference between the fee simple value and the price actually paid by the buyers other than martine in the wallingford and naf transactions the difference will be based on a calculation that assumes that the buyers paid for an interest proportionate to the interest actually purchased minus martines attributed percentage interest in keeping with the second and third principles and in light of grays egregious conduct gray and saffell as martines former general partners shall transfer their respective ownership interests in naf associates to hmg gray saffell and fieber shall also be jointly and severally liable to hmg for the distributions martine has thus far received from the wallingford and naf transactions net of martines investment cost because my approach is different than that taken by any of the parties the parties shall confer and attempt to present an order qualifying the award under the criteria outlined in the preceding paragraph within three weeks of this opinion that quantification should be brought to present value in accordance with the following reasoning at trial hmgs damages expert anthony b creamer of arthur andersen  company calculated the present value of profits paid to the fieberside investors using two indices developed by the national council of real estate fiduciaries nacref the first index measures the total annual performance of real estate investments in the eastern united states without specification as to the type of real estate the second index measures the total annual performance of investments in retail properties in the united states as a whole creamers quite sensible rationale was that hmg was a reit and thus the loss of its time value in money should reflect its status as a company that makes real estate investments rather than passbook savings account deposits in calculating the rescissory damages advocated by his client creamer gave the fieberside investors credit for their investment costs but applied the consumer price index to bring those costs to present value i believe that the same index should be applied to both the investment costs and profits relevant to the award the fieberside investors were also likely to have invested in real estate or alternative investments eg equities with a larger annual return than the inflation rate although the indices are not markedly different it makes more sense to me to use the nacref index tracking investments in retail properties since that was the type of real estate investment at issue in the transactions see summa corp v trans world airlines inc delsupr  ad   cert denied  us   sct   ledd   court of chancery has broad discretion subject to principles of  fairness in fixing the prejudgment interest rate to be applied in keeping with the third principle i will enter an order that will disable norman fieber from controlling in any manner the future operation of the joint venture unfortunately the voluminous record does not contain all of the joint venture agreements necessary to determine exactly how to accomplish this result rather than shoot in the dark i direct the parties to confer on a method to accomplish this part of the remedy and to report to me regarding this issue at the same time as they present their views on the damages quantification this order is less extreme than a rescission order that would require norman fieber to transfer his complete ownership interest in the joint venture to hmg and thereby his right to share in future profits to the extent that such a partial transfer is not practicable i will be inclined to order a full transfer of norman fiebers ownership rights to ensure that he exercises no managerial control over the joint venture in the future lastly the parties should confer and present me with their respective positions regarding the propriety of applying postjudgment interest to the entire amount of the award see stone  co inc v silverstein delsupr ca no   walsh j apr   order to that end the parties shall quantify the difference between the award unadjusted by the nacref index and as thereby adjusted taken as a package this remedy makes hmg whole for the damages caused by the breaches of fiduciary duty and fraud committed by gray and fieber and holds gray and fieber properly accountable for their serious misconduct b are the defendants liable for hmgs attorneys fees the socalled american rule requires that prevailing litigants ordinarily bear their own attorneys fees and expenses two exceptions to the american rule are according to hmg applicable here these exceptions permit an award of attorneys fees as an element of damages if a prevailing party demonstrates that the losing defendants i engaged in bad faith conduct that increased the costs of the litigation or ii engaged in prelitigation conduct of a sufficiently egregious nature arbitrium cayman islands handels ag v johnston delch  ad    affd delsupr  ad   the mere fact that a corporate director has breached his duty of loyalty to the corporation does not justify an award of attorneys fees and expenses under the latter exception this exception to the american rule is narrow and should be applied in only the most egregious instances of fraud or overreaching boyer v wilmington materials inc del ch ca no   wl  mem op at  lamb vc may   quoting  arbitrium  ad at  otherwise every adjudicated breach of fiduciary duty would automatically result in a fee award ryan  ad at  applying this stringent standard i find that gray should be responsible to hmg for an appropriate award of attorneys fees and expenses his intentional bad faith misconduct prior to the litigation was totally unjustified weinberger v uop inc delch  ad    and rises to the level of egregiousness necessary to justify such an award grays conduct in this litigation has also made the litigation far more expensive than was necessary hmg was forced to litigate two successful motions to compel in order to obtain full document discovery from him gray even put the court through a charade early in the litigation at that time martine was a defendant because hmg had no idea that gray had dissolved it gray even verified and signed court filings that indicated that martine still existed indeed this court decided a motion on december   regarding whether personal jurisdiction could be exercised over martine after all these events hmg learned of martines dissolution through thirdparty discovery taken from grays personal accountant gray  it was only then that gray came clean and told hmg and the court that martine had been dissolved before the start of the litigation see dkt  thus grays conduct both before and during litigation justifies an award of fees and expenses unlike gray fiebers conduct does not rise to the level of egregiousness required to sustain an award of attorneys fees although fiebers misconduct was serious fieber is not as culpable as gray grays longstanding affiliation with hmg his role as president of the company his much more substantial experience serving as a director of public companies and his active efforts to cover up his own ownership interest support this conclusion fieber although deserving of blame is less sophisticated about corporate governance issues and is generally not as careful and meticulous a businessperson as gray he also seems to be a person inclined to place trust in longstanding friends including gray and thus likely to take his lead from them in situations — like this — where they seemed to possess the superior understanding of what was acceptable behavior the final judgment i will enter will therefore assess reasonable attorneys fees and expenses solely against gray the amount of such award shall be half of hmgs total fees and expenses left after gray pays fully for the costs incurred by hmg in connection with i its successful motions to compel and ii grays failure to promptly disclose the fact that martine had been dissolved prior to the litigation since i have exercised my discretion to award attorneys fees against gray at a level substantially less than the full award hmg sought i hope that gray will not burden hmg or the court with extensive nitpicking regarding the amount of hmgs fees in that regard i direct gray and hmg to attempt to agree upon the specific amount of such fees and expenses and if they are unable to do so to report to me on their respective positions in three weeks to the extent that the parties do not reach agreement i will determine an appropriate amount based on the reports and the existing briefing in connection with hmgs motion for attorneys fees under chancery court rule  as a result of hmgs two successful motions to compel iv for the foregoing reasons judgment shall be entered for hmg against defendants gray fieber and saffell the parties shall report back to me in three  weeks if an agreed upon order is not presented each party shall submit its position regarding the outstanding issues and an accompanying form of order  wieners and grays close personal relationship dates back to the late s  fieber thereafter joined the transco board of directors in   gray does not deny that such a conversation occurred but says he does not recall it tr  his testimony and posttrial brief incline toward the view that fieber was the one who first suggested that martine take a buyside interest in the transactions tr   gray posttrial reply br at  but see tr  fieber says gray is incorrect and was the initiator fieber admits he may have initiated a later discussion that brought martine into the larger of the two transactions tr   indeed gray — a relentless note taker accounting ledger maintainer and financial details man — created a norm file and norm summaries tracking his many investments with fieber see eg px   i reject grays lawyers claim that the portions of the notes i cite were made later  in defending this case gray contends that his style of not speaking at board meetings or other large meetings and of allowing wiener to do so demonstrates that wiener was the dominant player in the transactions the fact that gray reserved his influence for adviserlevel discussions or facetoface negotiations with fieber does not render him noninfluential a multivolume treatise could be written on the extraordinary power wielded by the taciturn within complex organizations  as noted previously gray is a meticulous man who is a relentless notetaker and document retainer it is striking how often he copied wiener and rothstein on documents that do not raise an illicit reference while failing to do so as to documents that do  then known as betsy gray robbins see px   he also denies ever leading norman fieber to believe that he was not a martine partner tr   my doubts regarding the fiebers ignorance of the address change are heightened by norman fiebers rather odd deposition testimony on the subject in his deposition fieber denied knowing how the address came to be changed in the agreement or even whether his son had drafted the agreement n fieber   but in that same testimony fieber says that at one time gray told him to use fiebers address for martine and purported to explain why that made sense n fieber   none of the other three hmg directors who voted to ratify the transactions had a conflict of any kind  i say apparently because grays and fiebers trial and deposition testimony about the nature and purpose of this investment were quite confusing despite that confusion i do not draw the illicit inferences that it was a sham to repay gray for helping fieber facilitate the wallingford and naf transactions at an inadequate price from that investment that hmg does  i note that hmg had presented evidence sufficient to support a finding that gray and fieber engaged in at least one other sales transaction the socalled lambert ii transaction with a corporation on whose board gray served in which gray took an undisclosed buyside interest this evidence buttresses my conclusion that fiebers and grays acts were not inadvertent and that fieber was not unwitting as to grays strong personal interest in martine  at trial jim fieber tried to lay blame for this on his assistant who typed the letters for him tr  i find the fiebers assertion that their clerical help is responsible for so many suspicious things incredible and even if true the fiebers are responsible for the acts of their agents jim fiebers further testimony that he didnt view it as unusual for a person to guarantee a  obligation for fellow family members supports my view that in the fiebers world ones familys interest is ones personal interest tr  see also tr   the obvious family focus of the questionnaires should have also alerted fieber to his duty to disclose martines interest  admittedly gray quibbled with the management fee the fiebers charged the naf partners in view of the fact that no redevelopment was going on and that there was also a property manager for all the properties owned by the joint venture  in  the naf investors made another cash contribution of  which explains the increase from the  they originally invested tr   sadly it appears that gray hesitated to disclose his interest in wallingford after hmg discovered his interest in the naf transaction px   tr   i reject grays assertion that this litigation is a pretext by wiener to squeeze gray out of his interest in the adviser  hmg also pled a conspiracy claim against all three of these defendants hmg did not brief this claim in its posttrial briefs and i see no reason to reach the claim as to gray and fieber in view of my disposition of hmgs other claims  gray does agree with fiebers contention that grays personal interest was too immaterial to have affected the outcome of the hmg boards vote on the transactions or to justify a rescissory damages award gray post trial br at   see also aronson v lewis delsupr  ad    citing § a for the proposition that if selfdealing is present and the transaction is not approved by a majority consisting of the disinterested directors then the business judgment rule has no applicability in determining demand futility  fiebers narrower construction of this argument — that grays interest is immaterial since it arose after the negotiations were completed — is no more persuasive gray expected to participate on the buyside from the beginning of the negotiations it also makes no public policy sense to create an exception to entire fairness review for transactions involving directors who assume conflicted and nondisclosed postures after negotiations on terms are concluded but before the transactions close and receive board approval such an exception would invite abuse  while noncompliance with §§ a s disclosure requirement by definition triggers fairness review rather than business judgment rule review the satisfaction of §§ a or a alone does not always have the opposite effect of invoking business judgment rule review that one might presume would flow from a literal application of the statutes terms see  r franklin balotti  jesse a finkelstein the delaware law of corporations and business organizations §  at  d ed citing  discussing cases cf kahn v lynch communication sys inc delsupr  ad    subsequent history omitted in an interested merger involving a controlling stockholder approval by an effectively functioning special committee of disinterested directors merely shifts burden so that the plaintiff must prove that the transaction is unfair rather satisfaction of §§ a or a simply protects against invalidation of the transaction solely because it is an interested one id as such §  is best seen as establishing a floor for board conduct but not a ceiling  under the approach i believe the business judgment rule and §  dictates the nature of a directors undisclosed selfdealing interest does not lack legal significance rather the materiality or nonmateriality of that interest remains an important factor in determining whether the transaction resulted from a fair process and resulted in a fair price  the abundant documentary evidence relevant to the transactions which bears grays fingerprints is striking in comparison to the absence of documents demonstrating wieners close involvement while gray and fieber acknowledge that gray was involved in negotiating the transactions with fieber including participating in discussions regarding price tr   gray  they assert that grays negotiating authority was limited and that gray simply acted as a gobetween for wiener tr  in this regard they make much of the fact that there is not concrete evidence that gray negotiated as opposed to discussed price during his many conversations with the fiebers regarding the transactions i do not draw the same inferences they do from this fact for one thing how can hmg prove what occurred in oral conversations between gray and the fiebers their selfserving denials of negotiations are hardly persuasive most important the absence of real negotiations between gray and fieber if true does not weaken hmgs case it strengthens it i credit wieners and rothsteins testimony that gray was supposed to have been negotiating for the best price and that he led them to believe that he did so  i place little weight on this admittedly awkward for hmg fact the ks also disclose that the hmg board regards the transactions as tainted and is pursuing this lawsuit to obtain a remedy nor do i find convincing the defendants argument that the price had to be fair because hmg paid transco the same proportionate price as the fieber investors paid hmg in the transactions i place no weight on the transco factor since they were one pair of pants with two pockets if transco has an interest in any recompense from hmg that is a matter between it and hmg  nolan is not a certified appraiser but has extensive experience in the real estate field so i decided to consider his testimony despite a credible challenge to his credentials mounted by hmg nolan did not perform a formal valuation of the affected properties as of  while i believe nolan sincerely attempted to give his honest opinion about the financial fairness of the transactions his rather unique role playing approach was heavily dependent on assumptions he made about the motivations and roles of the humans involved see eg tr  since those assumptions do not comport with my view of the evidence i give little weight to his testimony  the parties invested a great deal of energy in briefing the admissibility of the deposition testimony and hearsay statements of jim lavin proffered through jim fieber at trial the longstanding property manager for the portfolio regarding the propriety of using the  appraisals to set the transaction values in  for the purposes of this opinion i will somewhat charitably assume see lavin  the defendants view that lavin had the authority as property manager for sba in  to speak about value on hmgs behalf so to permit the introduction of his alleged statement to jim fieber dure dc i will also assume that his deposition testimony is admissible under chancery court rule a andor under dure dc because lavin somehow continues to be hmgs agent even though he now works for the joint venture even so lavins testimony does not materially aid the defendants read as a whole lavins testimony reflects the position that the  appraisals understated the value of the portfolio and wallingford in  eg lavin  as does his contemporaneous advice that sba should update the relevant appraisal before selling wallingford px a moreover lavin vehemently disclaimed any expert status regarding the portfolio properties values when the defendants tried to obtain his testimony in such capacity  there is no question that fieber committed equitable fraud  similarly i am not persuaded that saffell conspired with gray to defraud or otherwise harm hmg  i would also note that to the extent that fieber had simply violated his duty of care and to the extent hmgs exculpatory charter provision was potentially applicable § b seems to contemplate liability for a director who personally benefits from his own gross negligence in such a situation § biv appears to preclude an exculpatory charter provision from limiting the directors liability but see rothenberg v santa fe pac corp delch ca no   wl  at  jacobs vc may   indicating that § biv is plainly directed to violations of obligations other than the duty of care that subsection states that a corporation may not limit a directors liability for any transaction from which the director derived an improper benefit  while fieber should be liable to hmg for this portion of the relief awarded i note my view that gray and saffell are primarily responsible for this portion of the judgment and that fieber should have a meritorious claim for indemnity or contribution against them in the event that he must pay any or all of this portion of the judgment to hmg in the first instance  one possible remedy might be an order requiring norman fieber to transfer his voting rights in naf associates and the joint venture under the appropriate agreements to hmg  hmg reads thorpe v cerbco inc del supr  ad    as having modified and broadened this exception so that any investigative and litigation costs incurred by a corporation to prosecute a breach of loyalty case against its directors are automatically recoverable this is a misreading thorpe simply required defendant directors who pursued a corporate opportunity for themselves to reimburse the corporation for outside counsel fees the corporation incurred to obtain advice for a special committee of outside directors regarding the selfinterested transaction the defendants proposed because such fees were made necessary by the course of events initiated by the defendants breach thorpe v cerbco inc delch ca no   wl  at  allen c sept   interpreting supreme court mandate on
