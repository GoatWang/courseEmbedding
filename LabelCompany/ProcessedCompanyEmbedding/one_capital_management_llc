investment objectives at the least risk possible inherent in that is a fiduciary responsibility to protect the assets they have accumulated and to provide a level of comfort with their investments in the capital markets providing peace of mind is essential in helping clients make the right decisions especially when their emotions might persuade them to do otherwise beginning with a belief that portfolio structure is the single most important element to creating a successful investment portfolio and experience on an aftertax basis we build customized globally balanced portfolios our philosophy is that in order to achieve our clients objectives capital must be deployed around the globe to reach assets with high real return we blend active management of global large cap equities with exchange traded funds etfs and fixed income to construct our multiasset class portfolios we utilize etfs as a means to access capital markets and asset classes that enhance the return of portfolios and reduce risk expressed in terms of return volatility it is our use of low correlation asset classes and portfolio structure rebalanced systematically that generates enhanced returns while reducing risk cash  cash equivalents municipal bonds us government bonds sovereign bonds developed markets global investment grade bonds high yield bonds preferred stocks emerging markets bonds us large cap equity us mid cap equity us small cap equity us micro cap equity canada large cap equity canada small cap equity international large cap equity international mid cap equity international small cap equity emerging markets equity us reits international reits developed markets its important to note as well that we hold both growth and value style equity in our portfolios at a  mix between the two to further diversify the portfolio in our efforts we tailor each account to the particular clients financial goals risktolerance levels tax status and special situations our global investment strategies position us to meet client preferences that vary along the risk return spectrum combining asset classes in a single optimized portfolio offers distinctly superior performance potential the equity allocation is structured to maximize returns while controlling risk we do this by diversifying the portfolio with assets that have low correlations to one another as such we can reduce volatility and enhance returns the majority of equity assets are allocated in large company stocks and this is enhanced with exchange traded funds to access stocks of smaller companies including microcap companies and an allocation to emerging markets stocks for the fixed income portion of the account foremost is safety of principal while generating a reliable stream of income history has shown that in times of equity market volatility bonds prove to the best stabilizer of return in fact producing real net of inflation return during those times the low correlation from each asset class drives down volatility and through rebalancing actually increases return potential tax management along the way assures that our clients keep most of what they earned one capital
