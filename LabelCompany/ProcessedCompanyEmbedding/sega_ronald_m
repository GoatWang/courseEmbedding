held works by ronald m sega infrared detection of microwave induced surface currents on flat plates by ronald m sega book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the surface currents induced by electromagnetic radiation incident on conductive bodies produce joule heating measurable by infrared techniques qualitative studies have shown that surface current amplitude information can be determined from the surface heating pattern a quantitative analysis via infrared techniques of surface current amplitude distributions on the flat plates is presented and the results are compared to actual current distributions determined from electromagnetic computer code calculations and probe measurements this correlation study on flat plates is an essential step toward the infrared measurement of current amplitude distributions on more complex shapes analysis of probe measurement accuracies and scattering effects by john dennis norgard book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide the measurement accuracy of electromagnetic em field probes as a function of probe orientation relative to the incident field was investigated in addition the mutual coupling effects between em field probes in close proximity to each other were observed far field measurements were performed in an anechoic chamber and compared to predicted values the results were used to determine the most accurate use of em field probes for measuring fields inside metal cavities resonant coupling through a slot to a loaded cylindrical cavity  experimental results  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the effect of cavity geometry on the energy coupled through a slot aperture is investigated through the use of planar mappings of the internal cavity field a copper cylinder closed at both ends is constructed with copper mesh sections incorporated at the ends of the cylinder and in the cylinder wall opposite a thin slot aperture placed in the wall the frequencies used for testing are  ghz internal field mapping is accomplished by placing thin carbonloaded sheets in the plane of interest and recording the digitized temperature distribution using an infrared scanning system the sheets are calibrated such that the temperature data is transformed to current densities or electric field strengths using several positions for the detection material a threedimensional field profile is obtained the onset of the internal cavity resonance is studied as it is related to the energy coupled through small apertures keywords electromagnetic compatibility electromagnetic coupling bdot probe measurement by john d norgard  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the scattering of an incident electromagnetic em plane wave from a single bdot probe and the interaction and mutual coupling between two bdot probes were evaluated using a
