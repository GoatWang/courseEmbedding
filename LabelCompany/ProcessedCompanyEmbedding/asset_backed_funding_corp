overthecounter offexchange forwards options spot market swaps trading participants regulation clearing house related areas banks and banking finance corporate personal public v t e an assetbacked security abs is a security whose income payments and hence value are derived from and collateralized or backed by a specified pool of underlying assets the pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets which are unable to be sold individually pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them to be sold to general investors a process called securitization and allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets the pools of underlying assets can include common payments from credit cards auto loans and mortgage loans to esoteric cash flows from aircraft leases royalty payments and movie revenues often a separate institution called a special purpose vehicle is created to handle the securitization of asset backed securities the special purpose vehicle which creates and sells the securities uses the proceeds of the sale to pay back the bank that created or originated the underlying assets the special purpose vehicle is responsible for bundling the underlying assets into a specified pool that will fit the risk preferences and other needs of investors who might want to buy the securities for managing credit risk – often by transferring it to an insurance company after paying a premium – and for distributing payments from the securities as long as the credit risk of the underlying assets is transferred to another institution the originating bank removes the value of the underlying assets from its balance sheet and receives cash in return as the asset backed securities are sold a transaction which can improve its credit rating and reduce the amount of capital that it needs in this case a credit rating of the asset backed securities would be based only on the assets and liabilities of the special purpose vehicle and this rating could be higher than if the originating bank issued the securities because the risk of the asset backed securities would no longer be associated with other risks that the originating bank might bear a higher credit rating could allow the special purpose vehicle and by extension the originating institution to pay a lower interest rate and hence charge a higher price on the assetbacked securities than if the originating institution borrowed funds or issued bonds thus one incentive for banks to create securitized assets is to remove risky assets from their balance sheet by having another institution assume the credit risk so that they the banks receive cash in return this allows banks to invest more of their capital in new loans or other assets and possibly have a lower capital requirement contents  definition  structure  types  home equity loans  auto loans

references  further reading  external links definitionedit an assetbacked security is sometimes used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets and sometimes for a particular type of that security – one backed by consumer loans or loans leases or receivables other than real estate in the first case collateralized debt obligations cdo securities backed by debt obligations – often other assetbacked securities and mortgagebacked securities mbs where the assets are mortgages are subsets different kinds of assetbacked securities example the capital market in which assetbacked securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories abs mbs and cdos italics added in the second case an assetbacked security – or at least the abbreviation abs – refers to just one of the subsets one backed by consumerbacked products and is distinct from a mbs or cdo example as a rule of thumb securitization issues backed by mortgages are called mbs and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called cdo  securitization issues backed by consumerbacked products – car loans consumer loans and credit cards among others – are called abs structureedit on january   the united states securities and exchange commission sec promulgated regulation ab which included a final definition of assetbacked securities definition of abs the term assetbacked security is currently defined in form s to mean a security that is primarily serviced by the cash flows of a discrete pool of receivables or other financial assets either fixed or revolving that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period plus any rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the security holders the sec has interpreted the phrase convert into cash by their terms to exclude most assets that require active behavior to acquire cash – such as the selling of nonperforming assets and physical property it has also interpreted the phrase discrete pool to exclude those that can change in composition over time leasebacked securities the new rule expands the definition of assetbacked security to include leasebacked securities as long as the residual value of the leased property is less than  of the original securitized pool balance or less than  in the case of motor vehicle leases however such securities may be shelfregistered on form s only if the residual value of the leased property represents less than  of the original securitized pool balance or less than  in the case of motor vehicle leases delinquent and nonperforming assets the new rules provide that a security may be considered to be an assetbacked security even if the underlying asset pool has total delinquencies of up to  at the time of the proposed offering as long as the original asset pool does not include any nonperforming assets however consistent with current practice shelf registration on form s  will be available only if delinquent assets constitute  or less of the original asset pool an asset is considered to be nonperforming if it satisfies the chargeoff policies of the sponsor or applicable bank regulatory agencies or if it would be considered a chargedoff asset under the terms of the applicable transaction documents exceptions to the discrete pool requirement the new rules generally codify the sec staff’s position that a security must be backed by a discrete pool of assets in order to be considered an abs however the new rules establish the following exceptions to address market practices  any security issued in a master trust structure would meet the definition of assetbacked security without limitation  assetbacked securities will also include securities with a prefunding period of up to one year during which up to  of the offering proceeds or in the case of master trusts up to  of the aggregate principal balance of the total asset pool whose cash flows support the abs may be used for subsequent purchases of pool assets  the new rules also include within the definition of assetbacked security securities with revolving periods during which new financial assets may be acquired in the case of revolving assets such as credit cards dealer floorplan and home equity lines of credit there is no limit to the length of the revolving period or the amount of new assets that can be purchased during that time for securities backed by receivables or other financial assets that do not arise under revolving accounts such as automobile loans and mortgage loans an unlimited revolving period will be permitted for up to three years however the new assets added to the pool during the revolving period must be of the same general character as the original pool assets according to thomson financial league tables us issuance excluding mortgagebacked securities was  usd  billion  issues  usd  billion  issues typesedit home equity loansedit securities collateralized by home equity loans hels are currently the largest asset class within the abs market investors typically refer to hels as any nonagency loans that do not fit into either the jumbo or alta loan categories while early hels were mostly second lien subprime mortgages firstlien loans now make up the majority of issuance subprime mortgage borrowers have a less than perfect credit history and are required to pay interest rates higher than what would be available to a typical agency borrower in addition to first and secondlien loans other he loans can consist of high loan to value ltv loans reperforming loans scratch and dent loans or openended home equity lines of credit helocwhich homeowners use as a method to consolidate debt auto loansedit the second largest subsector in the abs market is auto loans auto finance companies issue securities backed by underlying pools of autorelated loans auto abs are classified into three categories prime nonprime and subprime prime auto abs are collaterized by loans made to borrowers with strong credit histories nonprime auto abs consist of loans made to lesser credit quality consumers which may have higher cumulative losses subprime borrowers will typically have lower incomes tainted credited histories or both owner trusts are the most common structure used when issuing auto loans and allow investors to receive interest and principal on sequential basis deals can also be structured to pay on a prorata or combination of the two credit card receivablesedit securities backed by credit card receivables have been benchmark for the abs market since they were first introduced in  credit card holders may borrow funds on a revolving basis up to an assigned credit limit the borrowers then pay principal and interest as desired along with the required minimum monthly payments because principal repayment is not scheduled credit card debt does not have an actual maturity date and is considered a nonamortizing loan abs backed by credit card receivables are issued out of trusts that have evolved over time from discrete trusts to various types of master trusts of which the most common is the delinked master trust discrete trusts consist of a fixed or static pool of receivables that are tranched into seniorsubordinated bonds a master trust has the advantage of offering multiple deals out of the same trust as the number of receivables grows each of which is entitled to a prorata share of all of the receivables the delinked structures allow the issuer to separate the senior and subordinate series within a trust and issue them at different points in time the latter two structures allow investors to benefit from a larger pool of loans made over time rather than one static pool student loansedit abs collateralized by student loans “slabs” comprise one of the four along with home equity loans auto loans and credit card receivables core asset classes financed through assetbacked securitizations and are a benchmark subsector for most floating rate indices citation needed federal family education loan program ffelp loans are the most common form of student loans and are guaranteed by the us department of education usde at rates ranging from – if the student loan is serviced by a servicer designated as an exceptional performer by the usde the reimbursement rate was up to citation needed as a result performance other than high cohort default rates in the late s has historically been very good and investors rate of return has been excellentcitation needed the college cost reduction and access act became effective on october   and significantly changed the economics for ffelp loans lender special allowance payments were reduced the exceptional performer designation was revoked lender insurance rates were reduced and the lender paid origination fees were doubled a second and faster growing portion of the student loan market consists of nonffelp or private student loans though borrowing limits on certain types of ffelp loans were slightly increased by the student loan bill referenced above essentially static borrowing limits for ffelp loans and increasing tuition are driving students to search for alternative lenders students utilize private loans to bridge the gap between amounts that can be borrowed through federal programs and the remaining costs of education the united states congress created the student loan marketing association sallie mae as a government sponsored enterprise to purchase student loans in the secondary market and to securitize pools of student loans since its first issuance in  sallie mae is now the major issuer of slabs and its issues are viewed as the benchmark issues although to a few this may have been unfair or inflationary it appeared to have been legitimate stranded cost utilitiesedit rate reduction bonds rrbs came about as the result of the energy policy act of  which was designed to increase competition in the us electricity market to avoid any disruptions while moving from a noncompetitive to a competitive market regulators have allowed utilities to recover certain transition costs over a period of time these costs are considered nonbypassable and are added to all customer bills since consumers usually pay utility bills before any other chargeoffs have historically been low rrbs offerings are typically large enough to create reasonable liquidity in the aftermarket and average life extension is limited by a true up mechanism solar photovoltaicsedit recently securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital for example solarcity offered the first us asset backed security in the solar industry in  othersedit there are many other cashflowproducing assets including manufactured housing loans equipment leases and loans aircraft leases trade receivables dealer floor plan loans and royalties intangibles are another emerging asset class trading assetbacked securitiesedit in the united states the process for issuing assetbacked securities in the primary market is similar to that of issuing other securities such as corporate bonds and is governed by the securities act of  and the securities exchange act of  as amended publicly issued assetbacked securities have to satisfy standard sec registration and disclosure requirements and have to file periodic financial statements the process of trading assetbacked securities in the secondary market is similar to that of trading corporate bonds and also to some extent mortgagebacked securities most of the trading is done in overthecounter markets with telephone quotes on a security basis there appear to be no publicly available measures of trading volume or of number of dealers trading in these securities a survey by the bond market association shows that at the end of  in the united states and europe there were  electronic trading platforms for trading fixedincome securities and derivatives with  platforms for assetbacked securities in the united states and  in europe discussions with market participants show that compared to treasury securities and mortgagebacked securities many assetbacked securities are not liquid and their prices are not transparent this is partly because assetbacked securities are not as standardized as treasury securities or even mortgagebacked securities and investors have to evaluate the different structures maturity profiles credit enhancements and other features of an assetbacked security before trading it the price of an assetbacked security is usually quoted as a spread to a corresponding swap rate for example the price of a credit cardbacked aaa rated security with a twoyear maturity by a benchmark issuer might be quoted at  basis points or less to the twoyear swap rate indeed market participants sometimes view the highestrated credit card and automobile securities as having default risk close to that of the highestrated mortgagebacked securities which are reportedly viewed as substitute for the default riskfree treasury securities securitizationedit main article securitization transaction see also credit enhancement securitization is the process of creating assetbacked securities by transferring assets from the issuing company to a bankruptcy remote entity credit enhancement is an integral component of this process as it creates a security that has a higher rating than the issuing company which allows the issuing company to monetize its assets while paying a lower rate of interest than would be possible via a secured bank loan or debt issuance by the issuing company abs indicesedit see also assetbacked securities index on january   cds indexco and markit launched abxhe a synthetic assetbacked credit derivative index with plans to extend the index to other underlying asset types other than home equity loans abs indices allow investors to gain broad exposure to the subprime market without holding the actual assetbacked securities advantages and disadvantagesedit a significant advantage of assetbacked securities for loan originators with associated disadvantages for investors is that they bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form by pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets the tranching of these securities into instruments with theoretically different riskreturn profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different risk appetites and investing time horizons asset backed securities provide originators with the following advantages each of which directly adds to investor risk selling these financial assets to the pools reduces their riskweighted assets and thereby frees up their capital enabling them to originate still more loans assetbacked securities lower their risk in a worstcase scenario where the pool of assets performs very badly the owner of abs which is either the issuer or the guarantor or the remodeler or the guarantor of the last resort might pay the price of bankruptcy rather than the originator in case the originator or the issuer is made to pay the price of the same it amounts to reinventing of the lending practices restructuring from other profitable avenues of the functioning of the originator as well as the norms of the issuance of the same and consolidation in the form of either merger or benchmarking internal same sector external different sector this risk is measured and contained by the lender of last resort from time to time auctions and other instruments that are used to reinject the same bad loans held over a longer time duration to the appropriate buyers over a period of time based on the instruments available for the bank to carry out its business as per the business charter or the licensings granted to the specific banks the risk can also be diversified by using the alternate geographies or alternate vehicles of investments and alternate division of the bank depending on the type and magnitude of the risk the exposure of these refinanced loans to bad credit type ii decisions particularly in the banking sector unscrupulous lending or the adverse selection of credits is hedged against by the sellers of the same or the restructurers of the same thinking of securitization insurance as a panacea for all the ills of bad credit decisions might lead to the hedging of the risk by the transfer of the hot potato from one issuer to another without the actual asset against which the loan is backed reaching an upswing in value either by the demandsupply mismatch being addressed or by one of the following factors the economic productivity of the business cycle being reversed from downturn to upturn monetary and fiscal measures more buyers than sellers in the market a breakthrough innovation on a daytoday basis the transferring of the loans from the subordinate debt freshly made and highly collateralized debt to the subordinate realizable subordinate nonrealizable senior as well as bad securitized debt might be a better way to distinguish between the assets that might require or be found eligible for reinsurance or write – off or impaired against the assets of the collaterals or is realized as a tradeoff of the loan granted against or the addition of goods or services this is totally built up in any bank based on the terms of these deposits and dynamic updation of the same as regards to the extent of the exposure or bad credit to be faced as guided by the accounting standards and adjudged by the financial and nonmarket diversifiable risks with a contingency for the market nondiversifiable risks for the specified types of the accounting headers as found in the balance sheets or the reporting or recognition company based declaration of the standards of the same as short term long term as well as medium term debt and depreciation standards the issuance of the accounting practices and standards as regards to the different holding patterns adds to the accountability that is sought in case the problem increases in magnitude the originators earn fees from originating the loans as well as from servicing the assets throughout their life the ability to earn substantial fees from originating and securitizing loans coupled with the absence of any residual liability skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality this is an intrinsic structural flaw in the loansecuritization market that was directly responsible for both the credit bubble of the mids decade as well as the credit crisis and the concomitant banking crisis of  the financial institutions that originate the loans sell a pool of cashflowproducing assets to a specially created third party that is called a specialpurpose vehicle spv the spv securitization credit derivatives commodity derivative commercial paper based temporary capital and funding sought for the running merger activities of the company external funding in the form of venture capitalists angel investors etc being a few of them is designed to insulate investors from the credit risk availability as well as issuance of credit in terms of assessment of bad loans or hedging of the already available good loans as part of the practice of the originating financial institution the spv then sells the pooled loans to a trust which issues interest bearing securities that can achieve a credit rating separate from the financial institution that originates the loan the typically higher credit rating is given because the securities that are used to fund the securitization rely solely on the cash flow created by the assets not on the payment promise of the issuer the monthly payments from the underlying assets – loans or receivables – typically consist of principal and interest with principal being scheduled or unscheduled the cash flows produced by the underlying assets can be allocated to investors in different ways cash flows can be directly passed through to investors after administrative fees are subtracted thus creating a “passthrough” security alternatively cash flows can be carved up according to specified rules and market demand thus creating structured securities this is an organized way of functioning of the credit markets at least in the developed primary nontradable in the open market company to

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be

they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a
