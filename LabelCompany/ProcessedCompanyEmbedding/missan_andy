priorities send us a letter have an opinion about this story click here to submit a letter to the editor and we may publish it in print yokohama japan  after several years of opening factories nissan motor corp now will channel investment into new products and technologies said ceo carlos ghosn top priorities will be electrified drivetrains fuel cell technologies autonomous drive systems and connectedcar products ghosn told a small group of reporters last week most of our investments are in products and technologies now that most of the expansion of the company has been done ghosn said the shift caps a period during which nissan plowed much of its profits into a flurry of factory building especially in emerging markets we were building a new plant in china we were building a new plant in brazil we were building a new plant in mexico we were expanding the plant in thailand we were expanding the plant in indonesia ghosn said now all those plants are finished nissans global production footprint is set for the moment and its time to focus on developing topnotch vehicles to be built at the plants just coming online ghosn said capital investment will continue at the joint plant nissan is building with daimler ag to produce infiniti vehicles in mexico but ghosn said that investment is really small compared to the amount of capacity increase we had for the last three to four years nissan does not disclose global capacity figures but with its new factories it lifted global output to  million vehicles in the fiscal year ended march  from  million four years earlier the timing contrasts with that of rival toyota motor corp which is ending a threeyear moratorium on new factories that had been ordered by president akio toyoda during that time toyota invested in a new modularized platform that will underpin a new generation of vehicles starting this year nissans capital spending dropped  percent to ¥ billion  billion in the fiscal year ended march  from the year before spending on rd edged up  percent to  billion in that same period ghosn pointed to a redesigned titan pickup due in the us this year and a new line of crossovers including a redesigned murano as the kind of products nissan aims to ramp up nissan is enjoying greater production flexibility these days thanks to the japanese yens declining value against other currencies including the dollar that allows nissan to tap its existing capacity in japan even if temporarily rather than invest in additional capacity overseas indeed nissan plans to boost japan production to  million vehicles in  from  in the fiscal year just ended ghosn said us demand for the rogue crossover will help drive the japan rampup because there is no room to build more of the hotselling rogue in north america he said ghosn said absorbing the us overflow was an opportunistic move to spare investment the weaker yen makes it more competitive to ship japanmade vehicles overseas in earlier remarks ghosn praised superloose monetary policies in japan that have the side effect of undermining the yens value against other currencies the policy of bringing back the yen to a more normal and competitive level is paying off he said without any doubt youre going to see the production of nissan in japan going up you can reach hans greimel at hgreimelautonewscom  follow hans on twitter hansgreimel tags technology

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
