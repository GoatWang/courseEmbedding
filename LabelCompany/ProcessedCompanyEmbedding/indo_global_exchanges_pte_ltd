board type free  posts today  this board is dedicated to the activities of nio tech corp an early stage mining development company based in the united states with the ultimate goal of becoming one of the few strategic suppliers of niobium  nio tech corp is actively engaged in the exploration and development of its nemegosenda property located  miles from chapleau ontario first explored in the s modern exploration techniques have verified that the nemegosenda property contains significant niobium mineralization throughout its  acres of easily accessible land in a climate of growing demand for niobium and diversity of suppliers nio tech plans to develop this whollyowned deposit into a truly worldclass resource specialty metals and rare earth elements are the building blocks of a modern society and while we may not realize it many of them feature prominently in our lives niobium is no exception the united states and most developed countries have included niobium in the list of critical metals as the play an important role in national security niobium is used in gas pipelines building construction bridge construction automotive manufacturing aerospace and evergrowing uses in the electronics we use every day just  of niobium used in the construction of a car can reduce its weight by kg a savings which can reduce fuel consumption by  which reduces emissions source world steel association in august  researchers at the university of texas developed a new process which uses niobium oxide to turn ordinary windows into “smart windows” glass which can change properties eg transparent to opaque at the touch of a button in the coming years such uses for niobium are undoubtedly going to increase and that means demand for this specialty metal is going to continue to increase source university of texas at austin august   during the s and s the usgs flew over north america and used airborne magnetometers to find anomalies in the earths magnetic field that could signify big rare earth deposits since then mining companies have taken it upon themselves to confirm the presence of these deposits nio tech corp’s whollyowned nemegosenda property is one of these rare earth deposits consequently nio tech corp is positioned to enter the marketplace as the first additional supplier of niobium in over  years some rare earth metals are actually quite commonplace but niobium is a metal which is scarce in north america most of the existing deposits are located deep underground thereby significantly reducing their economic viability in contrast the nemegosenda property is located in miningfriendly ontario easily accessible to highways railways and power and perhaps the most important of all the deposit of niobium is very close to the surface   about niotech nio tech corp is an early stage mining development company based in the united states with the ultimate goal of becoming one of the few strategic suppliers of niobium it has been formed by the following event latest news sarissa resources inc otc markets pink srsr sarissa or the company announces the sale of the nemegosenda specialty metals and rare earth project from niostar corporation a canadian subsidiary of sarissa to indo global exchanges pte ltd otc markets igex indo global under the terms of the sale the indo global will file a form s to facilitate a distribution of shares so that postsplit  of the indo global shares shall be held by existing sarissa shareholders as of the record date and  will be held by existing indo global shareholders sarissa shareholders will receive  new share of indo global for every  sarissa shares held on the date of record indo global intends to file for a name change to niobium technology corporation a symbol change to nbtc and for a  reverse split for approval by the financial industry regulatory authority inc finra indo global will own outright the nemegosenda property an approximately acre property located near chapeau ontario exploration and geological work has been completed by dominion gulf company in the late s and early s by eastmaque gold minesinternational musto in the s and more recently by sarissa resources inc in total diamond drilling of  holes totaling over  meters has been completed a historic estimate was prepared by ge red parsons for dominion gulf company that indicated for the d zone  tons of  percent nbo material in a block  by  feet in size and to depths up to  feet based on gulfs drilling and a  foot adit which penetrated  feet into the zone a tonne bulk sample was extracted and subsequently was used by the colorado school of mines research institute in a pilot plant where niobium extraction from the ore was consistently achieved at an  to  level an economic analysis of the project was completed in  by bj lerner for dominion gulf company which demonstrated the projects projected feasibility at that time the historical resources estimate the historical feasibility and the historical metallurgical testing are based on data obtained by previous owners in the s a qualified person as defined under ni has not done sufficient work to comment on the relevance or reliability of this historical estimate the company is not treating the historical estimate as nor can the historical estimates be relied upon as verification of current mineral resources or reserves niobium also known as columbium is a rare metal primarily obtained from pyrochlore a mineral found occurring in carbonatites well known for its use in steel alloys to add corrosion resistance and maintain high conductive properties niobiums melting point of c enables the metals alloys to maintain their qualities at very high temperatures approximately  of worldwide niobium consumption is dedicated to the production of steel while  is used in the production of super alloys and the final  is used in the development of superconductor applications within the technology electronics and medical industries john oshea director of indo global commented we are very excited to have been able to acquire the nemegosenda project mr oshea added the landscape for niobium is rapidly changing demand is strong and its uses continue to grow according to industry sources global demand for niobium is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of  through  with only  significant existing producers in the world all of which have recently completed full or partial acquisition by chinese interests there is a growing concern about diversity of supply dan byrnes president stated this is the completion of a major step in the restructuring of the project which will enable the necessary capital to be raised and permit the project to move forward along the path to developing a mine mr byrnes added the nemegosenda project is uniquely suited to fill a growing need in the diversity of supply for niobium the combination of a significant historical record of geological work completed the inherent lower costs to mine a surface deposit the location in a mining friendly jurisdiction close to all of the necessary infrastructure required for production and the use stateoftheart separation and refining technology to produce a mix of both traditional and hightech useful niobium and zirconium products provides the newly named niobium technology corporation with an exceptional opportunity otto pichler director said i am looking forward to the opportunity to join niobium technology corporation and work to move the nemegosenda project forward having the project in a revitalized reporting public company will allow for greater transparency for investors the opportunities for niobium and zirconium production as well as other payables in this deposit are substantial our plans are to assemble a world class team that is suitable to develop this worldclass deposit nemegosenda the nemegosenda property comprises approximately  acres in northern ontario that in historic exploration and testing has indicated the existence of considerable carbonatitehosted niobium mineralization   the property is easily accessible off of highway  between timmins and chapleau ontario chewett and collins townships the patented claims were purchased in january  for  canadian  payable over a fouryear period  and  royalty concessions on all mineral andor metal production from the property sarissa resources however retained the right to repurchase  of the royalty concessions at any time in the future for a predetermined price  the company believes that any potential extensions of the mineralized areas may be covered in its  acre holdings the nemegosenda property map was identified in the midnineteen fifties through aeromagnetic surveys conducted by gulf minerals canada limited subsequent exploration and testing as summarized in the ontario geological survey study  by rp sage click to read the full report in  highlighted a number of higher grade niobium zones of particular note zone d indicated  tons of  percent nbo material in a block  by  feet in size and to depths up to  feet based on gulfs drilling and a  foot adit which penetrated  feet into the zone based on this historic nonnicompliant data pg  this indicates the potential for approximately  pounds of nbo per ton of ore in situ  other zones within the property have also indicated smaller but meaningful niobium mineralization another area of mineralization of niobium and rare earths called the southeast area was previously outlined on the property it occurs  metres south east of the hawke zone formerly called d zone from the  and  drilling program by dominion gulf plus reassaying of nine drill holes by musto explorations in  which covered this area a historical resource of niobium mineralization was indicated to exist within an area of some m x m to a depth of m having a weighted average from the assays of all drill holes of  nbo  drill program st phase  during late  and early  sarissa drilled nine diamond drill holes in the d zone portion of the property totaling  metres to seek confirmation and depth extension of the niobium mineralization previously identified by dominion gulf company gulf notably all the holes returned significant niobium mineralization averaging  nbo over the entire  metres that were sent for assaying it should be noted that the drilling program successfully confirmed both the mineralized zone data historically reported and that the mineralization continues below what had previously been identified as the depth of the mineralized zone it has also demonstrated that the mineralized zone increases in grade and depth towards the eastern portion of the zone the three drill holes on the eastern end of the current drill sections returned ddh at e n includes m to m  m   nbo ddh at e n includes m to m  m   nbo note ddh was stopped at m ddh at e n includes m to m  m   nbo    drill program nd phase this program involved further diamond drilling to continue to expand on the mineralized niobium resource in the hawke d zone it was targeted to test the eastern extension and is conducted under the guidance of hillar pintson msc pgeo in addition the company has opened up  trenches in the se zone scintillomoter readings taken within the trenching area have provided significant readings the trenching program was conducted initially under the supervision of the late alan hawke and followed up on by geologist hillar pintson it was conducted in the middle of the se zone where fortynine  metre continuous channel samples were collected along the northern side of trench a and submitted for assaying the average grade over the full  metre length of the trench was  nbo in the  samples submitted for assay highlights included  samples of greater than  nbo and  samples greater than  nbo as well as the significant nbo results the samples returned anomalous values of tantalum and uranium along with  samples of greater than ten thousand ppm total rare earth elements of additional significance is that this trenching program was carried out in an area of the se zone that had not previously been drilled so continues to expand the area of potential mineralization in this area a followup drilling program has been initiated to test the areas underneath the zone exposed during the trenching program   exploration history   dominion gulf co completed a magnetic survey and several drill holes on the property the company’s initial focus was on the drilling of magnetic anomalies in the sezone most  likely caused by the pyrochloremagnetite rich pyroxenites by the fall of   holes had been completed totaling  feet  m of diamond drilling on the property approximately  of these holes were drilled in the dzone majority of which occurred on a crosssectional drilling pattern in  an adit was driven  feet  m into the main dzone to obtain a bulk sample and  was spent to investigate and develop a process of metallurgical extraction at the time this work resulted in a historic non  compliant resource estimate of approximately  –  short tons grading   nbo this resource estimate used a block model that  extended from surface to approximately  –  meters depth more information on the historic resource estimate is presented in the ni  compliant technical report completed by p chance  which is available through sedar musto exploration ltd continued exploration in the late s their predominant focus was on developing the ree potential in the sezone they completed an airborne magnetic and em survey of the property trenching work and reassayed some historic gulf dominion core for rees current exploration work sarissa began exploration again in  and drilled  holes in the dzone this work mainly looked at expanding and improving drill hole coverage on the crosssectional pattern drilled by dominion gulf co two holes were drilled in the sezone with ddh showing elevated ree concentrations and expanding the known extents of niobium mineralization currently a new drill program aims at duplicating historic gulf dominion holes in the dzone to validate and confirm historic data to enable the possible use of this data in an updated comprehensive resource estimate for the dzone this work follows on recommendations by p chance in the  ni  compliant technical report   metallurgical testing  a further aspect of this program will entail beginning metallurgical studies sgs lakefield research ltd has been retained to conduct a proof of concept program which will focus on the recovery of niobium compounds the multidisciplinary approach will fully characterize the ore investigate if physical ore upgrading is feasible by standard ore beneficiation processes and develop a hydrometallurgical method for the extraction and selective recovery of initially the nb phase the investigation should be considered as a scoping or prefeasibility study to establish a baseline flowsheet for targeted product recovery so far the first phase of metallurgical testing has been completed and no barriers to extraction have been identified this correlates well with the previous  of metallurgical research conducted by dominion gulf company in conjunction with the colorado school of mines research foundation in  the next stage metallurgical testing will focus on a more detailed mineralogical study sarissas recent drilling program has increased the confidence level in the historic exploration and subsequent evaluation to the point that an indicated resource may now be calculated for the d zone drill hole intersections with a weighted average grade of  are located within a surface area of some  square metres and to a depth of at least m in  an adit was driven  feet into the d zone where historic sampling indicated that the average grade contains a weighted average of  nbo in july  sarissa announced the completion of an independent technical report on its  owned niobium property in northern
