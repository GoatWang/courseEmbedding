currently assessing our options as how and if to proceed as a business we believe that our most likely scenario for survival is to merge with and into or to acquire an existing business to that end we are seeking merger candidates and intend to take steps to make us a more attractive merger candidate   if we are unable to begin a new business or enter into a merger with or acquire an existing business we will need to raise additional funds to continue as a business if we cannot secure additional funds we will have to cease our business and our investors will lose their entire investment

might never be able to sell any shares of our common stock that you purchase or own   item   selected financial data   we are a smaller reporting company as defined in rule b of the exchange act and are not required to provide the information required under this item   item   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report   this report contains forward looking statements relating to our companys future economic performance plans and objectives of management for future operations projections of revenue mix and other financial items that are based on the beliefs of as well as assumptions made by and information currently known to our management the words expects” “intends” “believes” “anticipates” “may” “could” “should and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forwardlooking statements the cautionary statements set forth in this section are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement   our auditor’s report on our september   financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next  months we may be required to suspend or cease our business   as of september   we had  cash on hand and in the bank management believes this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised we plan to satisfy our future cash requirements  primarily legal and accounting fees  by additional equity financing this will likely be in the form of private placements of common stock additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements   if we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a shell company to secure therefore we depend upon the success of the any private placement offering and failure thereof would result in our having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may not even be available to us however if such financing were available because we are a shell company we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could manage the debt load if we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing we would be required to cease as a business as a result investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment           we did not generate any revenue during the fiscal years ended september   and  we incurred operating expenses in the amount of  in the fiscal year ended september   these operating expenses were comprised of professional fees interest expense and office and general expenses since inception we have incurred operating expenses of    we have no current agreements to merge with any other entity   as of the date of this annual report the current funds available to the company will not be sufficient to continue operations the cost to of maintaining our reporting status for the next twelve months is estimated to be    results of operations   our expenses decreased to  for the twelve months ended september   from  in the twelve months ended september   this decrease was the result of a decrease in office and general expenses to  from  between the two periods as well a decrease in professional fees to  from  between the two periods as we had no revenues or additional losses in either period our net losses were the same as our total expenses   off balance sheet arrangements   as of the date of this annual report the current funds available to the company will not be sufficient to continue operations the cost to of maintaining our reporting status for the next twelve months is estimated to be  over this same period management believes that if the company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its reporting status with the sec it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company as such any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety   the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the companys financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of

and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business currently the company has a working capital deficit of  and net loss from operations since inception of  the company does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs giving substantial doubt for it to continue as a going concern the company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan or merge with an operating company there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern the company is funding its initial operations by way of issuing founder’s shares   in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things

expenses and seeking equity andor debt financing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain

in income in the period that includes the date of substantive enactment   net loss per share basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stakeholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the company because the company does not have any potentially dilutive securities the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share   recent accounting pronouncements pronouncements between september   and

to be disclosed in the reports filed under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow

with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based upon and as of the date of that evaluation he concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported as and when required the reason we believe our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective is because      no independent directors    no segregation of duties    no audit committee and    ineffective controls over financial reporting   managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting   thomas roger sawyer our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af and df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that   · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets     · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors and     · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate           our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september   in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in  internal control — integrated framework   based on our assessment our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believe that as of september   our internal
