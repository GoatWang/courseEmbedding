cigarettes draw criticism from fda medical groups by daniel j denoon from the webmd archives they are electronic alternative smoking devices that simulate the sensation of smoking they do not expose the user or others close by to harmful levels of cancercausing agents and other dangerous chemicals normally associated with traditional tobacco products  craig youngblood president of inlife an ecigarette company they are nicotine delivery devices intended to be used like a cigarette what happens to someone who stops inhaling the tars of cigarettes and inhales only nicotine we dont know there is at least the potential for harm  norman edelman md chief medical officer american lung association we are concerned about the potential for addiction and abuse of these products we dont want the public to perceive them as a safer alternative to cigarettes  rita chapelle fda spokeswoman ecigarettes dont make real smoke yet theyve ignited a firestorm of controversy you may have already seen ecigarettes  electronic cigarettes  for sale on the internet or at one of at least  kiosks at malls across the us ecigarettes are safer than cigarettes their makers say or imply but until ecigarettes are proven safe the fda is refusing to let them into the country and may soon ban their sale as major us medical associations have asked we have an open investigation into this issue fda spokeswoman rita chappelle tells webmd what is happening right now is fda has reviewed several ecigarettes ecigars and epipes and have refused entry of these products into the country we acted because these products appear to require fda approval for marketing and have not been reviewed by the agency an informal fda review of some of these products indicated that these products are not currently approved chappelle says if the fda bans ecigarettes an action many observers believe imminent it wont be the first north american agency to do so last month canadas health agency banned the importation or sale of ecigarette products whats all the fuss about at the heart of the issue is a debate over what the ecigarette really is whats an ecigarette like gunpowder the ecigarette is a chinese invention the first ones came from the ruyan company in 00 according to media reports ruyan says it sold 0 ecigarettes in 00 and its far from the only company making the devices continued the ecigarette comes in many shapes and sizes many look more or less like long cigarettes others look like cigars or pipes they all work the same basic way the user inhales through a mouthpiece air flow triggers a sensor that switches on a small batterypowered heater the heater vaporizes liquid nicotine in a small cartridge it also activates a light at the lit end of the ecigarette users can opt for a cartridge without nicotine the heater also vaporizes propylene glycol peg in the cartridge peg is the stuff of which theatrical smoke is made the user gets a puff of hot gas that feels a lot like tobacco smoke when the user exhales theres a cloud of peg vapor that looks like smoke the vapor quickly dissipates ecigarettes contain no tobacco products even the nicotine is synthetic the devices retail for 0 to 00 refill cartridge packs vary in price depending on nicotine content and liquid for doityourself refills are sold too each cartridge is good for several uses ecigarettes good so whats an ecigarette good for different ecigarette marketers stress different points for smokers who dont plan to quit tobacco some firms point to ecigarettes as a way to smoke in smokefree environments such as airplane lounges restaurants and workplaces for smokers who dont want to give up their nicotine addiction some firms suggest that switching to ecigarettes will reduce the harm of their habit for smokers who want to quit some firms suggest that ecigarettes may help people transition from smokers to nonsmokers the world health organization has asked marketers not to make this claim craig youngblood president of the inlife ecigarette company says that since regular tobacco is very bad for you something that assuages your nicotine habit without smoke must be less bad in our product you have nicotine or no nicotine peg and some flavoring in cigarettes you have nicotine peg and  chemicals and  carcinogens youngblood tells webmd there are  to 0 million people already addicted to nicotine should they have the choice to satisfy their addiction by other means  i am a proponent of harm reduction people have rights and choices and should be allowed to make them continued youngblood says his company makes no health claims he rejects the idea that his product is a smoking cessation device and says his company does not make that claim he also says his product is not sold to minors youngblood does make this claim ecigarettes are green there is no pollution of the environment with this product he says the vapor is not the same as smoke and for every odorfree ecigarette cartridge people throw in the trash smokers throw 0 smelly cigarette butts out their car windows some firms do suggest that ecigarettes are safer than tobacco cigarettes most point to a ruyanfunded study by tobacco researcher murray laugesen mbchb of health new zealand a private research firm laugesen analyzed ruyan ecigarettes and found nothing inherently bad in them  that is they contained what they said they contained and posed little threat of immediate harm but this was not a clinical study notes norman edelman md chief medical officer of the american lung association one of the organizations that has called for an fda ban on ecigarettes laugesen is trying to project what the effects of ecigarettes might be but he doesnt really know edelman tells webmd there are no clinical studies of longterm use of these products and some firms do claim that ecigarettes help people quit smoking after all theres an fdaapproved nicotine inhaler already in drug stores  pfizers nicotrol it doesnt look much like a cigarette but it doesnt look much different than some ecigarette products whats the difference the nicotrol inhaler is an approved smoking cessation device says the fdas chapelle because these ecigarette products havent been reviewed by the agency their labeling has to be reviewed their intended use has to be reviewed and all of their ingredients and components have to be reviewed ecigarettes bad edelman says nicotine addiction is bad and that people with the habit need help quitting not help continuing their habit in more socially acceptable ways and theres no proof that ecigarettes dont cause longterm harm thats what bothers all the health experts who discussed ecigarettes with webmd continued we cannot say they are good or bad because we dont have any scientific proof says eliana mendes md a pulmonology researcher at the university of miami what happens to someone who stops inhaling the tars of cigarettes and just inhales nicotine we dont know edelman says we are talking about use that might be three years five years  years we just dont know once you have the nicotine habit you are not likely to quit rather than quit ecigarettes might worsen users nicotine habits says michael eriksen scd director of the institute of public health at atlantas georgia state university and former director of cdcs office of smoking and health i have seen no evidence that people switch from tobacco cigarettes to ecigarettes or other smokeless tobacco products eriksen tells webmd if you look at how smokeless products are marketed they are sold as something to use at times you cant smoke the implication is you will increase nicotine exposure not reduce smoking well just be encouraging people to use more nicotine youngblood says his ecigarette products are being marketed only to people who already smoke and already have a nicotine addiction but eriksen says the unregulated sale of these products might get new users hooked  users who might then start smoking will ecigarettes get fewer people smoking or will people start with ecigarettes and graduate to tobacco cigarettes it is unknown whether these things are good bad or indifferent he says if for every person who used ecigarettes there was one fewer person smoking tobacco cigarettes that would be good but there is no evidence that will occur and theres one more issue that troubles doctors university of miami pediatrician and lung specialist michael light phd says underage users will get their hands on ecigarettes  even if marketers like youngblood refuse to sell them to minors it will be easy for kids to get the product light tells webmd it could be a way to get kids into the nicotine habit to get them to smoke it is a ploy pagination top picks pipes  cigars less harmful

fda issues warning as tests find electronic cigarettes illegal by daniel j denoon from the webmd archives july  009  the fda today warned americans not to use electronic cigarettes  but did not ban the sale of the smokefree devices ecigarettes and similar products are sold online and in scores of mall kiosks across the us they deliver nicotine in a puff of hot gas that feels like smoke nicotinefree versions are also sold now the fda has tested two of the devices the smoking everywhere and njoy products the products we reviewed so far we found to be illegal attorney michael levy director of the fdas office of compliance in the division of drug evaluation and research said today during an fda news conference but the fda has not banned them because there is pending litigation on the issue of fdas jurisdiction over ecigarettes levy said why call a news conference we felt it important that while there is litigation and we are considering options there is no reason to be confused about fdas position on this issue joshua sharfstein md fda principal deputy commissioner said at the news conference fda analyst benjamin westenberger described testing 9 cartridges from the two ecigarettes at the fdas st louis facility among the findings all but one cartridge marked as having no nicotine actually contained the addictive substance cartridges marked as having low medium or high amounts of nicotine actually had varying amounts of nicotine one of the cartridges contained a toxic antifreeze ingredient diethylene glycol the devices emitted tobaccospecific nitrosamines which are human carcinogens the devices emitted tobaccospecific impurities suspected of being harmful to humans the fda news conference also featured experts who issued strong warnings against ecigarettes jonathan winickoff md chairman of the american academy of pediatrics tobacco consortium warned that the products seem tailormade to appeal to kids he said the devices could addict kids to nicotine and turn them into smokers matthew mckenna md director of the cdcs office of smoking and health noted that ecigarettes can be used in smokefree environments and thus weaken the health benefits of antismoking efforts jonathan samet md director of the institute for global health at the university of southern california warned that ecigarettes are nothing like fdaapproved nicotinedelivery devices shown to help people quit smoking he noted that ecigarettes have no proven benefits but very clear risks continued since 00 the fda has been trying to prevent ecigarettes from entering the country to date 0 shipments have been refused but this has not stopped distribution and sale of ecigarettes canada fully banned the devices in march 009 ecigarette makers and distributors have argued that their devices are safer than real cigarettes thereby mitigating the harm of smoking some have implied that their products help people quit smoking tobacco products the fda rejects both claims because the devices can deliver a dose of synthetic nicotine the agency sees them as unapproved drugdelivery devices with unknown safety and whether they can safely help people quit smoking is also unknown while they have a clear potential to entice new smokers with their fruit and candy flavors how ecigarettes work the ecigarette comes in many shapes and sizes many look more or less like long cigarettes
