colberg senior editor    am executive summary the stock primarily owes its price to enthusiasm over insider buying however that insider’s large block trade orders sparked a market manipulation investigation that led to his broker being sanctioned temporarily losing his license and paying tens of thousands in fines though la jolla had to shelve its most promising drug candidate analysts haven’t revised price targets to reflect the massive decline in market opportunity with la jolla’s history of missed terrible earnings even bullish analysts anticipate horrible earnings into the foreseeable future with little real institutional interest anyway more shares recently have been sold out than new positions added our calculations suggest the remaining market opportunity for la jolla is a fraction of analysts’ projections  the market has recently blasted la jolla pharmaceutical co nasdaq ljpc shares to mystifying levels thanks primarily to insider buying but that insiders stock trades previously sparked a market manipulation investigation that left him unscathed and his broker sanctioned that key inside buyer is la jollas chairman of the board kevin c tang mr tang is also managing partner of tang capital a firm named by the securities and exchange commission as a relief defendant in a  lawsuit alleging insider trading fraud and deceit in securities trading that lawsuit resulted in a  fine against tang capitals founder chen tang mr kevin tang tang capital and several of his other entities own  million shares or  percent of la jollas stock the company hasnt responded to our request for comment but investors may find other viewpoints here this situation makes us think of shark tank star kevin olearys comment when youre an investor you can look at the quantitative and qualitative elements of an investment but theres a third aspect what you feel in your gut theres a bad feeling in our gut about la jolla and here are some quantitative and qualitative reasons why… the tang connection la jolla director kevin tang ordered trades that spurred an investigation into market manipulation on appeal the sec upheld findings that mr tangs broker engaged in a manipulative scheme and caused his brokerage firms books and records to be inaccurate mr tang and his longtime broker friend edward brokaw testified about how the stock broker carried out mr tangs orders for several big block trades of monogram biosciences at the time mr tang was not yet a la jolla director and his hedge fund owned  million shares of monogram mgrm and  million cvr units that may in  mr brokaw and his family also owned  cvr units the rather fascinating november  sec document describing the case that the broker regulatory group finra built against mr brokaw is here we hit the highlights below take the  thing down … a dollar here are some entertaining and telling outtakes from recorded conversations plus background the next trading day may  tang gave brokaw another order to sell two blocks of  mgrm shares again with one block each near the open and close and again to sell them quickly and aggressively one of brokaws assistants william ewing relayed the order to trader david zitman  during that telephone conversation ewing told zitman that tang wanted to sell monograms stock hard at the opening of the market and then began to explain that tang owns the rights    theyre pricing the rights off the stock     at that point ewing testified brokaw who was listening to the call signaled for ewing to knock it off by swiping a hand across his throat ewing therefore told zitman sorry sorry enough said im not thats im not supposed to be going into that anyways hes trying to he wants to sell zitman entered the morning order into the firms computer system to be executed by the equity trader zitman then called brokaw to confirm the trading instructions during that conversation zitman asked if he should take the fing thing down inaudible a dollar brokaw replied yeah  cents yes zitman pressed he wants it to be doneand if i take the thing down to  and it bounces back to  he doesnt care brokaw confirmed no right tangs order was subsequently executed in increments at prices declining from  to  mr brokaw pushed traders to hammer monogram stock for as little as one penny he explained to a trader that lowering monograms stock price would increase the value of monograms cvrs he described the trades as a battle of good versus evil he could  be going away for a long time doing that the next day mr brokaw received mr tangs orders to again sell  shares of monogram stock at the open and close of the market this was his third block order in four days mr zitman sprang into action again but not without expressing concerns about mr tangs suspicious orders the scene is described below along with more recorded conversation zitman entered the order which was filled within seconds of the market open at an average price of  zitman called brokaw to confirm the sales and brokaw told zitman to sell another  at the close at  pm brokaw confirmed the order again with zitman telling him that tang wanted him to execute the order with a minute to go and spread it out a little bit    hit the bids     this heightened concerns for mr zitman who raised questions about the legality of mr tangs orders zitman what hes trying to mark the close note marking the close by buying or selling shares near the close of the market is considered one sign of a market manipulative practice brokaw yeah zitman you should you shouldhe he could fing be going away for a long time doing that brokaw really zitman yeah you cant mark the close its fing illegal brokaw eh i didnt think so zitman yeah f it i no im not marking the close for him brokaw no no no zitman im not giving up my fing license brokaw no no no me neither no just sell  on the close orders refused when staffers speak up a couple of other traders expressed concerns about the rationale for mr tangs trades one trader even took the matter to the firms compliance officer who said it doesnt sound right were going to  i dont want you trading or transacting in monogram with that client going forward mr zitman and mr brokaw later discussed mr tangs suspicious trades according to tape recordings of that conversation brokaw responded that theyre a little worried about the way the orders are coming in and    i said    i hear you but you know what this is the way this guy wants to trade zitman expressed concern that the trades could nevertheless be construed as a little bit suspect to which brokaw replied you know what its a free country zitman responded no its not thats my issue someone could walk in here and say hey you have a pattern of selling the first minute and selling the last    minute when brokaw replied so what zitman explained that there could be a compliance issue mr tang testified in his buddys disciplinary hearing that if the cvrs contingent value rights which are like options were fully valued at the end of the pricing period his tang capital partners fund would hold cvrs worth more than  million as for mr tang heres the kicker described in the sec document… unlike the hearing panel which did not find credible tangs testimony about his reasons for the seemingly manipulative trades the nac credited tangs testimony about his trades the nac thus found that finra staff had set forth insufficient evidence proving that tangs transactions were manipulative on appeal the national adjudicatory council reversed mr brokaws market manipulation finding by finra but did find mr brokaw violated his ethical duty by not adequately questioning mr tangs orders ultimately mr brokaw was fined  and his broker license was suspended for one year until january  mr kevin tangs transactions ultimately lacked sufficient evidence to prove they were manipulative but the deal certainly doesnt pass the sniff test damage control saves stock price we contend mr tangs funds recent purchases of la jolla shares is damagecontrol he is well aware that la jolla was forced to drop its previous lead drug candidate after a lupus nephritis study bombed in  the stock price bombed too the stock was delisted and moved to the otc bulletin board on march   a transfusion in the form of a private stock offering the following may barely revived the company followed by a for reverse stock split it ultimately took a for reverse stock split in january  for la jolla to return to the nasdaq the chart below graphically shows what happened to la jollas stock after its  drug candidate got shelved the stock lost nearly  percent of its value plunging to  per share source morningstar the chart below shows what happened recently when its latest top drug candidate got shelved may  and the market learned that mr tangs fund had jumped in and bought stock june  and june  source morningstar established institutions are not very interested but when we ask who else is buying we hear crickets though many class a institutional funds have been rushing to add biotechs to their portfolios their interest in la jolla has been scattered and minimal  shown here while some small institutional types have bought recently sharewise there have been a lot more positions sold out than new positions established in la jolla click to enlarge source nasdaq also lets take a look at a nasdaq stock consultant chart that summarizes … yikes … where la jolla stock stands in regard to bullish and bearish trends click to enlarge source nasdaq clinical candidates just one  and not all its cracked up to be la jolla pulled the plug on its pair of star candidates when it couldnt address fdas rigorous requirements and why was the company caught offguard that the product would be held to  gasp  expensive fda standards maybe it was trying to squeeze every dime out of average shareholders while hyped hope persisted the drop to one candidate is nicely described here interestingly the key booted product is the kidney disease candidate gcs whose rights la jolla acquired in  from director kevin tangs and ceo george tidmarshs former company so that boot must have been hard to swallow regardless la jolla is now hitched to its only clinicalstage product ljpc for hypotension or very low blood pressure la jolla is now recruiting patients for a phase iii study to determine if ljpc increases blood pressure the study is expected to be complete in september  more red flags join the pile at this point analysts apparently havent changed their price targets to reflect the loss of gcs in the chart below also note theres likely little upside considering that la jolla shares are trading   right in the middle target range of  source yahoo finance the problem is that the analysts price targets erroneously assume the former leading candidate gcs is alive and well and likely to reach commercial success …not booted to the curb an analyst report released to clients at the end of march notes high commercial potential for the booted product and limited commercial potential for the remaining product ljpc an interesting sidenote describes some limitations noting mortality benefits or strong costbenefit rationale are key to doctors accepting the drugs  particularly with effective cheap generic hypotensive alternatives available the jeffries report states its  price target is based on  per share for ljpc and  per share for the shelved product so what happens if the dropped product is erased from the equation la jolla stock then winds up with a  price target  well below the current  per share even  per share is too high  the potential market is just too small even a  share price assumes the drug will enter an overly optimistic vision of the market and enjoy an unusual degree of success we believe the market is rather small for ljpc because if approved the drug would be useful only in special cases because there are so many cheap effective alternatives some analysts consider the peak sales opportunity in crh catecholamineresistant hypotension at  million and higher but we see the peak crh market opportunity at a fraction of that …  million some analysts estimate  percent penetration  more reasonably  percent we believe  even a jefferies report states overall physicians view current armamentarium of hypotension drugs as adequate in treating severe hypotensive patients yet some really bullish analysts estimate  patients while were estimating  to  max also if it clears clinical trials ljpc might find some use in limited special cases of cirrhosis of the liver cirrhosis patients can develop potentially fatal conditions such as bleeding sepsis or hepatorenal syndrome nysehrs resulting in progressive kidney failure and sometimes death but we have to remember this iffy hrs use is years away because enrollment in the early phase  study is just occurring nevertheless were estimating  patients  percent market penetration a  cost an improbable guesstimate with all kinds of insurance questions and  percent chance of success in this hrs application this puts the cirrhosis use market opportunity at about  million so combined the real potential valuation of la jollas remaining drug is  million even without removing erroneous assumptions terrible earnings estimates shareholders earnings estimates look pathetic even before accounting for the lost candidates check out the estimates below click to enlarge source yahoo finance not surprisingly those estimates are backed by an equally pathetic earnings history click to enlarge source yahoo finance looming conversion of  million shares of preferred stock into common stock poses extreme dilution to todays shareholders when the company converts preferred stock and lucky insiders exercise it the current  million shares available for trading would shoot to  million shares this means a  percent dilution to todays shareholders so the value of todays  stock would be diluted to  and the company states it may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans thus swinging the ol dilution hammer again conclusion dont be cinderella let investors make informed decisions an exasperated analyst said of the la jolla situation indeed la jolla struggles with a potential market of under  million who knows whether the drug will even get past trials and the fda and an aggressive insider whose trades sparked a market manipulation investigation  that ultimately left his broker buddy sanctioned holding a suspended brokers license and a much lighter wallet stock offerings private offerings and reverse stock splits have propped up a comatose la jolla time and again and as forewarned todays prices could easily cough up another dilutive stock offering indeed this suckers grossly overvalued relative to the cash it could possibly ever generate its kind of like what warren buffett said about how investors sometimes drift into behavior akin to that of cinderella at the ball they know that overstaying the festivities  that is continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuation relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future  will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice kick off your glass slippers and run before they bring on the pumpkins and

investment turned on tcp’s ability to get control of the board at the annual meeting it seems we were wrong about that the big run up in the stock occurred because the fda granted marketing approval of fanapt™ which demonstrates one of the great things about investing in liquidation plays good surprises we generally ascribe zero value to the intangibles because more often than not that’s what they’re worth very occassionaly however the  intangibles are worth something and purchasers below liquidation value have a free option on them we’re not going to pretend that we thought it was a real possibility in this instance as lefty gomez liked to say “i’d rather be lucky than good” here’s the text of the announcement of the fda approval fda approves vanda pharmaceuticals’ fanapt for the treatment of schizophrenia rockville md may  — vanda pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq vnda announced today that the us food and drug administration fda has granted marketing approval of fanapt™ iloperidone for the acute treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia the approval was supported by two placebocontrolled phase iii clinical studies comparing fanapt™ to placebo and active control in patients with schizophrenia as well as safety data from more than  patients fanapt™ is a mixed dopamine d  serotonin hta receptor antagonist and belongs to the class of atypical antipsychotics “the approval of fanapt™ marks a new opportunity for many patients with schizophrenia who experience only partial responses to current therapies to achieve better control of their symptoms” remarked dr peter j weiden professor of psychiatry and director of the psychotic disorders program at the university of illinois at chicago “having fanapt™ available is a major help for our patients in offering an effective antipsychotic with an excellent side effect profile across a wide range of major tolerability problems associated with other antipsychotic therapies” the efficacy of fanapt™ for the treatment of schizophrenia was supported by two placebocontrolled shortterm  and week trials both trials enrolled patients who met the dsmiiiiv criteria for schizophrenia and fanapt™ was shown to be superior to placebo in controlling symptoms of schizophrenia across doses of mg to mg per day the recommended target dose range of fanapt™ is mg to  mg per day titration to the target dose of mg per day can be achieved in  days vanda plans to make fanapt™ available in pharmacies later this year –snip– and tcp’s withdrawal of its director nominees vanda pharmaceuticals announces withdrawal of director

believe that the backgrounds and qualifications of these candidates when considered as a group with the other directors of the company will provide a balance of knowledge experience and capabilities

issuing the following press release vanda pharmaceuticals responds to announcement and filing by a group led by tang capital partners lp rockville md – february   – vanda pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq vnda “vanda” or the “company” today issued the following statement regarding two letters sent to vanda by tang capital partners lp “tcp” and a sec filing by tcp stating its intent to among other things nominate two directors to stand for election at vanda’s  annual meeting of stockholders and submit proposals at the  annual meeting to amend vanda’s bylaws and request that the board of directors of vanda take action to liquidate the company in accordance with delaware law and the company’s bylaws the company’s board of directors is divided into three classes of approximately equal sizes the members of each class are elected to serve a year term with the term of office of each class ending in successive years the two current directors of the company whose terms expire at the  annual meeting of stockholders are its current chief executive officer mihael h polymeropoulos md and its current chairman of the board argeris n karabelas phd dr polymeropoulos is a founder of vanda and has served as president and chief executive officer and a director of vanda since may of  dr karabelas has served as a director and chairman of the board since  when he cofounded vanda with dr polymeropoulos the company intends to nominate both of these individuals for reelection at the  annual meeting of stockholders vanda believes that its current board of directors has the independence the knowledge and the commitment to successfully implement the company’s business plan and to deliver value for the company and its stockholders “the board is disappointed that tang capital has opted to conduct an election contest particularly when the company is so close to receiving a response from the fda regarding its lead compound iloperidone instead of working with us to maximize stockholder value tang capital has chosen to create unnecessary costs and distractions for the company at this important time” said brian k halak phd a member of the company’s board of directors and chairman of its nominatingcorporate governance committee vanda believes the best interests of its stockholders will be better served by reelecting drs polymeropoulos and karabelas and by continuing to move forward with its current business plan vanda therefore intends to oppose tcp’s nominees and to work actively to reelect drs polymeropoulos and karabelas vanda carefully reviewed tcp’s proposals to amend its bylaws and determined that such amendments would not be beneficial to the company and its stockholders vanda believes that the proposed amendments requiring unanimous board consent to approve certain transactions would in the company’s opinion severely restrict the ability of the company and its board of directors to conduct business in addition vanda believes that the proposed amendment requiring the company to hold its annual meeting on april  of each year would create unnecessary timing constraints and would not allow the company enough time to prepare and file its annual proxy statement in a careful thoughtful and thorough manner consequently vanda intends to oppose tcp’s proposal to amend the company’s bylaws in addition the company does not believe that it is currently in the best interests of vanda or its stockholders for the company to “cease ongoing operations” and liquidate the company as has been suggested by tcp vanda’s board of directors and management regularly review all of the strategic options for managing the company to create the greatest value for its stockholders vanda’s board of directors and management team have been and remain intensely focused on acting in the best interest of the company and creating value for all of its stockholders in connection with this goal vanda’s management team has been working diligently over the past several months with the food  drug administration “fda” to reevaluate its response to vanda’s new drug application “nda” for iloperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia in september of  management met with the fda to discuss the fda’s notapprovable letter relating to the nda and submitted a complete response on november   at the request of the fda the fda accepted the complete response for review and has set a new target action date of may   the company believes that even in the absence of an approval by the fda for iloperidone there remains significant unrealized value in the company’s other compounds therefore the company does not believe that liquidation is currently in the best interests of the company or its stockholders and intends to oppose tcp’s proposal to liquidate the company tcp has previously criticized vanda’s spending in general and specifically its spending since the receipt of the notapprovable letter from the fda however vanda has substantially reduced spending and dramatically reduced its employee headcount in the wake of the fda letter the company has been working on a reduced budget and has curtailed all nonessential expenditures vanda believes that this approach will allow it to continue to minimize any reduction in stockholder value based on the company’s cash assets while it awaits the fda’s reply to its complete response unfortunately due to the course of action taken by tcp the company will now need to expend significant unanticipated amounts in connection with its  annual meeting of stockholders moreover under delaware law the board of directors is given the power to determine in the first instance whether the company should be dissolved the only exception to the clear statutory scheme involves unanimous approval of liquidation by all stockholders which given the board’s perspective is extremely unlikely the company’s board of directors has determined that it remains to be in the best interests of the company to continue its operations vanda has previously met with tcp to discuss its proposals and would be willing to meet with them again in the future conclusion vnda is an interesting play with its stock closing yesterday at  the company has a market capitalization of m we estimate the net cash value to be around  higher at m or  per share this value is of course deteriorating rapidly and the challenge for investors is to determine which of two outcomes is more likely if tcp can get on the board quickly stop the cash burn and liquidate the company we’re likely to see a reasonably good return if tcp cannot get onto the board quickly or at all the company will continue to burn cash and the investment will be a dud vnda has a staggered board so this will make tcp’s task difficult we’re inclined to take a position now and see how this plays out although we’re going to keep a close eye on the proceedings vnda closed yesterday at  the sp index closed yesterday at  hat tip to manny full disclosure  we do not have a holding in vnda this is neither a recommendation to buy or sell any securities all information provided believed to be reliable and presented for information
