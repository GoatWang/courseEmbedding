investment profile vista’s investment size has historically ranged from  million to  million in equity capital our investment committee process for vetting transactions and continuous expansion of best practices enables us to offer value on larger transactions and funding below this range vista’s target investments are typically profitable or nearly profitable and are past the venture stage of their lifecycle in most cases we are the majority shareholder and only outside investor this reduces the distractions commonly associated with having multiple financial investors and permits us to take a differentiated longterm perspective we are flexible and creative and pursue investments using a variety of transaction types management andor leveraged buyouts minority investments acquisition or growth financings recapitalizations or restructurings spinouts or divestitures take private transactions it’s easy not to focus on culture it’s easy not to focus on people and it’s easy not to focus on developing and training but vista does all of that and more –kim eaton ceo aptean industry focus vista has focused on the software industry since our founding we look for opportunities to build and grow sustainable successful businesses in our target markets vista seeks companies that research and develop proprietary software solutions and either license them to their customers or leverage them internally to create a technologyenabled service this includes companies that develop and market software software as a service and technologyenabled business and information services we believe there are various elements to the software business model that can create a differentiated scalable and highly profitable business identifying specific companies that can be transformed through the implementation of operational best practices and turned into predictable high cash flow businesses is key to vista’s target selection while our portfolio companies need not fit a specific profile many of our prospective investments have some common characteristics investment characteristics existing or potential recurring revenue mission critical “sticky” solutions experienced management team favorable customer characteristics defensible competitive position favorable market dynamics strong customer value proposition collaborative partnership vista provides strategic and operationallyfocused investment with the goal of adding meaningful sustainable value to each company within our portfolio in addition to investment capital we offer our portfolio companies access to
