this commentary is currently not available please check back later delaware international small cap fund formerly delaware focus global growth fund quarterly commentary june   within the fund while stock exposure largely drove the fund’s performance during the second quarter of  the consumer discretionary and healthcare sectors also contributed from a country perspective australia and the united kingdom contributed to performance the fund’s strongest individual contributors included evotec aristocrat leisure and fincantieri shares of german drug researchanddevelopment company evotec continued to outperform during the second quarter after reporting betterthanexpected results for its fiscal year ended  and better margins in the first quarter of  moreover the company achieved its first milestone payment for diabetes research from its research alliance with global pharmaceutical company sanofi australian company aristocrat leisure is a global manufacturer and seller of gaming machines the company also supplies gaming systems software and other gamingrelated products aristocrat leisure outperformed during the quarter after reporting betterthanexpected results at the end of may its north america class iii gaming business continued to grow and take market share its international class iii gaming business benefited from the recent launch of a new gaming product lightning link additionally digital daily average users daus continued to grow fincantieri an italian shipbuilder focusing on cruise ships and navy vessels outperformed after announcing new ship contracts with viking ocean cruises and the french navy in addition the company announced the anticipated acquisition of stx france as it continues to consolidate the market in contrast from a sector perspective information technology detracted from the fund’s performance during the quarter from a country standpoint south korea and india weighed on performance the fund’s largest individual detractors included tongda group outokumpu and sumco tongda group is a chinese consumer electronic component manufacturer it supplies plastic and metal casings for notebook pcs electrical appliances and smartphones the company’s share price declined during the quarter amid allegations of lost market share at one of its key customers chinese smartphone manufacturer oppo we decided to exit the fund’s position in tongda group during the quarter shares of finnish stainless steel manufacturer and ferrochrome producer outokumpu underperformed during the quarter after technical issues in one of its ferrochrome furnaces curtailed production additionally the company said it expected ferrochrome pricing to be weaker throughout  sumco a japanese manufacturer of silicon wafers underperformed during the quarter because of concerns about an increased supply of silicon wafers the company’s share price struggled despite the relatively small announced capacity increase compared to the overall market and strength in demand the company had benefited from tightness in the wafer market and a supportive pricing environment positioning and outlook the fund’s country and sector relative weights continue to be driven primarily by bottomup stock selection and where we’re finding attractive opportunities as a result at the end of the quarter the fund’s largest sector overweights relative to its benchmark the msci acwi ex usa small cap index were consumer discretionary and materials the largest country overweights were brazil and france the largest underweights relative to the benchmark from a country perspective were south korea and australia real estate and financials were the largest sector underweights we continue to be confident about the opportunities present in international smallcap equities while political and geopolitical uncertainty persists throughout the world we believe the underlying economies in many regions remain supportive smallcaps outside the united states have exhibited strong performance over the past few quarters and we believe that should continue in our view international smallcaps are poised to catch up to the relative outperformance of us smallcaps over the past decade as the us economic recovery has been a step ahead of nonus markets we see key catalysts that should lead to an inflection point such as reduced political risk strong earnings or an overall encouraging macro environment while we are mindful of the risks present we remain optimistic regardless of the economic environment we will continue to adhere to our disciplined approach
