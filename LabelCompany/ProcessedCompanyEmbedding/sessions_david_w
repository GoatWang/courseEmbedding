phone add to basket category personal sessions description a session of energy work with david lasts an hour and generally takes place over skype sometimes by phone each session is complete in and of itself but a group of sessions can also allow for a very deep reworking of your system usually we start with some conversation to see where you’re at then we connect with the wider field invite the help and wisdom of your bodymind system and your off planetary team that’s when the energy and sounds really begin to flow most people are aware of energies shifting and releasing during a session even though we may be thousands of miles apart the sound has a very physical impact often emotions are released and frquently there is a great sense of pressure and weight being freed as ancient long held patterns give way more and more as we anchor into a new paradigm we are witnessing the integration of other aspects or dimensions of ourselves simply put our higher self is no longer outside of us it is incarnating becoming our inner self this happens in waves with many levels of our multidimensionality coming into form often for the first time afterwards there is a lot of energy in your field this continues to work and integrate over the coming days more may be released because major recalibrations take place sometimes with thousands of years of history being released the field takes a few days to rebalance itself drinking pure water being in nature and rest help the process david’s email is daviddavidmanningenergyworkcom reviews  reviews there are no reviews yet be the first to
