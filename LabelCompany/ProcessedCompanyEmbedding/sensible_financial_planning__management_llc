today contact us what’s included in my plan detailed action plan cash flow plan risk management tax minimization strategy integrated investment plan how do you put my plan together at sensible financial® planning we take a holistic and highly personalized approach to financial planning financial planning necessarily involves working with numbers a financial plan you can actually use requires numbers that are relevant to your life share we begin with a twopart kickoff meeting either in person or by telephone it may be inconvenient for you to come to our office first we ask about your life goals and discuss their financial implications we identify the issues you want the plan to focus on – the reasons you came to us often we suggest scenarios to illuminate the issues – we will use those in the plan we develop for you second we review the information you have sent us about your financial resources income and assets and the calls on those resources expenses and debts after the meeting we follow up with a request for the rest of the information we need analyze once we have all of the information we need we organize it in our framework we send you a set of assumptions summarizing the issues you want the plan to address your financial information and the scenarios we will develop to illuminate your financial issues once you approve the assumptions we develop a preliminary plan that estimates your sustainable living standard the amount you can spend every year from now through the end of retirement for each scenario we determine how much you need to save each year the risks to the plan the likely growth of your assets and the implications for your estate we assess your current investment portfolio from the perspectives of likely return risk and cost and compare it to several alternatives on those dimensions then we meet with you to review the preliminary plan we incorporate your views on the scenario and the asset allocation you prefer and finalize the plan propose we begin with the investment options in any k b or similar accounts we select the most cost effective then move on to accounts where your choices are not restricted consistent with your target asset allocation at the end of the previous step we recommend a diversified and efficient set of investments to help you accomplish your plan if you wish we can also recommend sources for any indicated insurance act if you wish you may retain sensible financial to support you as you implement the plan and to manage your assets on an ongoing basis in addition we can refer you to insurance resources to address insurance requirements identified in your plan we also have a list of tax and estate planning professionals who can assist you in those important areas what do you use to develop my plan esplanner a unique approach to financial planning esplanner focuses on the fundamental goal of saving and insurance –avoiding major disruptions in your family’s living standard through the years using advanced mathematical techniques we calculate the saving you need to support a stable lifestyle throughout your life and the life insurance required to preserve your household’s living standard in the face of risk what will this cost me we base our fee on the complexity of your financial situation factors in assessing complexity include • client and spouse or partner age • family income • number of children • investable liquid assets and real assets such as your home • number of investment accounts • number of investment positions securities held • availability and accessibility of your financial information our onetime fee for an integrated financial plan is usually between  and  the fee can exceed  in cases of unusual complexity eg for clients with many asset accounts stockrelated compensation or multiple real properties conceptually your sensible financial plan is very simple we begin with your financial goals and resources we add up all your resources and subtract the costs of your goals the difference is available for everyday living at your sustainable living standard you spend that “everyday living budget” evenly over your lifetime  by matching your financial resources and sustainable living standard with your financial goals we develop a saving plan to build the assets you will accumulate over your lifetime you will draw upon those assets to pay for later one time financial goals such as college for your children or a down payment on a second home and throughout your retirement your saving plan will enable you to track your progress from year to year adapting your savings and investing plans to changes in your income changes in your financial goals more or less favorable investment returns we begin by asking where you are in life and where you want to go you may be starting out – planning for a house maybe children and college – contemplating retirement no work some work different work or retired you may be a couple that wants a plan to buy a house put children through college and retire comfortably you may be single and plan to stay that way throughout your life your goals may be quantitative and financial – like a house down payment of a certain size or qualitative and “soft” such as a yearning for more family time regardless of where you start identifying your destination is the first step to getting there we work with you to build a financial plan that includes all of your major goals financial and nonfinancial we help you to specify the financial implications of your qualitative goals so that your living standard needn’t change to accommodate them given the choice most people prefer a stable living standard they want to live well now and later planning to live better later isn’t attractive neither is a decline in lifestyle once the paychecks stop arriving we work with you to identify a sustainable standard of living one you can maintain throughout your life – before and after retirement our integrated financial plan does not address every financial issue for example the plan does not include advice about health insurance coverage or about property and casualty insurance and of course no plan can address every conceivable issue we do our best to focus on the issues of greatest importance to you and those with the greatest likely impact on your financial goals your financial plan also includes an investment plan we assess your current investment portfolio including expected return and risk and any unusual risks these may include concentrated stock or bond holdings relationships between your investments and your employment and concentrated holdings of real estate we provide a set of alternative asset allocations and provide the risk and return implications for your financial goals this helps you to select the allocation that you prefer finally we recommend specific mutual funds to put that allocation into action your plan will encourage maximizing your financial resources we will identify longterm tax minimization strategies such as taxadvantaged accounts and asset location assigning assets to accounts to maximize aftertax return we will consider the longterm tax implications of multiple jobs retirement accounts and investment strategies we will help you to get the most out of your employee benefits package – taxadvantaged retirement accounts employer contributions to your retirement accounts and group life and disability insurance we can refer you to tax professionals to help with tax return preparation and specific complex tax issues you may plan to transfer assets to your children your grandchildren or other heirs your plan will identify potential federal estate tax issues that might interfere with your plans while we are not estate planning attorneys we’ll also outline other considerations that may affect your family’s ability to carry out your wishes should you be unable to do so even the most careful plan is subject to risks we will identify the risks to your plan if you were to die prematurely we will suggest capital replacement amounts that would counter these risks these amounts typically decline as the risk to your family’s wealth diminishes many people choose to purchase life insurance to fund the uncertain capital requirements similarly we will identify the risks to your plan associated with disability income replacement is required to mitigate this risk many people choose to purchase disability insurance to fund this uncertain income requirement finally we’ll review the risks to your plan of the potential need for longterm care ltc we’ll help you assess the potential financial impact insurance is also available to mitigate this impact sensible financial is not an insurance advisor or insurance agent or broker we can refer you to sources of life disability and longterm care insurance products that we believe to be reliable   sensible financial ® all rights
