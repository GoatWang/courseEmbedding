for consumer enterprise mobile industrial and connected device applications crossbar website corporate profile in the news ee times peter clarke august   reram startup bets on silver london — a resistive ram nonvolatile memory technology that could be embedded in socs and used in multilayered terabyte memory ics is being brought to market by a wellbacked and wellconnected startup called crossbar inc the company based in santa clara california has a working array that it claims validates its silverion based technology as a replacement for traditional nonvolatile memory this working chip is a cmos access controller monolithically integrated with a memory array more  ee times pc world agam shah idg news service august   crossbar takes on dram and flash storage with super fast super longlasting rram tech startup crossbar emerged from stealth mode monday to announce its version of rram resistive randomaccess memory a new type of memory that could be a successor to flash storage and dram the company founded in  will make and license its rram a nonvolatile memory which will be smaller faster and more powerefficient than nand flash and ram said george minassian ceo of crossbar it is higher density  and the current is much lower minassian said adding that the memorys physical and power attributes make it a suitable replacement for storage in smartphones tablets pcs and servers crossbar is claiming rram will deliver  times faster write performance  times less power consumption and  times more durability than nand flash the memory chips will be stacked and a tb module will be roughly half the size of a nand flash module with similar storage minassian said he could not estimate the price of a tb rram module but said it will cheaper than nand flash partly because rram is less expensive to manufacture crossbar crossbar will also license the technology to third parties it could be two or three years before the memory shows up in products but that depends on demand for the product minassian said its a matter of what company appears at what time minassian said rram differs from the way nand flash and ram operate unlike nand flash crossbars technology does not use transistors or trap a charge instead it uses a layered approach to store data an rram cell has three layers with a switch in the middle that helps determines whether the cell is storing a  or a  the top layer has a metallic electrode while the lower layer has a nonmetallic electrode the top layer passes metal ions into the switching media and into the lower layer which creates a filament to keep the electrodes connected what minassian called a short wire applying a negative charge breaks the wire and leaves a gap between the electrodes which leaves no resistance changing the status of the memory cell this is not a gate you use in standard nand and nor this is resistive which is where rram comes from minassian said rram uses existing material and can be made in factories prototypes are being made in factories of tsmc taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co minassian said crossbars rram doesnt contain transistors so it is easy to make as chips become smaller minassian said crossbar crossbars technology is very interesting and could be useful as manufacturing technologies improve and chips get smaller said jim handy principal analyst at objective analysis in an email its generally accepted that something is going to replace nand and dram someday since these technologies have scaling issues when that will occur is unclear handy said it is becoming more complex to make nand and dram as manufacturing technology improves at a rapid rate handy said intel which has the worlds most advanced chip factories will soon move to the 4nanometer process to make its chips manufacturing smaller chips with more features requires more attention to detail and chips could be vulnerable to a wider class of defects with that in mind and with the advent of d nand as a successor to todays planar nand there may be another five process generations or even more before alternative memory technologies have a shot at replacing nand flash the storys probably the same for dram handy said once a scaling limit has indeed been reached technologies like crossbars rram will rapidly take away market share from the entrenched players handy said other rram designs are being researched by academics and research institutions alternative forms of memory to nand and dram also include everspins mram magnetoresistive ram and pcm phasechange memory a memory type being pursued by micron and samsung semiconductor hewlettpackard is making a memory type called memristor  pc world the wall street journal don clark august   crossbar enters race to change memory chips several kinds of chips are used to store data all of them good at some parts of that job but not others a company called crossbar has been quietly planning to disrupt a big chunk of that memory market the silicon valley startup on monday becomes the latest to unveil plans for an alternative to flash memory the mainstay storage technology for products like smartphones tablets and digital cameras nand flash the most widely used variety is less expensive than some competing technologies per bit of data stored but nand chips are slower at writing data than retrieving it moreover chip makers fear that continuing to shrink nand circuitry to boost storage capacity will soon become difficult or impossible crossbar says it has developed a variant of a technology called rram that is  times faster than nand consumes onetwentieth the power stores data  times longer on chips that could be half the size a single chip based on its technology could store a trillion bites of data or a terabyte crossbar says by comparison the highestcapacity nand chips now on the market store  gigabits of data or  gigabytes storing a terabyte would require 4 of those chips notes jim handy a market researcher with objective analysis there are benefits beyond simply increasing how much data mobile devices and other gadgets might store says george minassian crossbar’s chief executive officer for one thing the slow datawriting speed of nand flash means that many devices also have to have another kind of faster chips–drams or dynamic randomaccess memories they are used for purposes such as temporarily storing images from digital cameras to minimize big delays when shooting photos minassian says those drams won’t be necessary if crossbar’s technology takes hold he says further reducing the cost and size of consumer products “you can take photos as fast as you want” he says some of this may sound familiar the list of companies pursuing new memory alternatives is long some of the new devices have reached the market but others remain largely an unfulfilled promise after years of investment crossbar’s technology is based largely on inventions credited to wei lu an associate professor of electrical engineering at the university of michigan the venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield and byers put up money to fund research on the concept and later backed crossbar–the exclusive licensee of the underlying patents where conventional memory chips use electrons to store data crossbar’s technology is based on tiny filaments that are formed by applying electricity from electrodes to a layer of amorphous silicon a noncrystalline cousin to the silicon used in conventional chips these act like on or off switches to record the presence or absence of a bit of data crossbar claims that its variant of rram or resistive randomaccess memory is simpler than others and can largely be fabricated on production lines now used to churn out conventional chips it can also be used to create multiple threedimensional layers of memory more easily than the widely used approach of creating separate chips and subsequently stacking them minassian says the company is announcing its plans after developing working prototypes based on the technology while crossbar may make and sell some chips of its own it plans mainly to license its technology to others–first to store data in specialized products known as socs for systems on a chip and eventually to makers of standalone memory chips minassian says handy says crossbar’s approach has some advantages but he argues that its inventions and other alternatives don’t really deserve much consideration until they prove that they can beat incumbents on cost once mass production begins “the guys who do nand flash and dram have been pulling any number of rabbits out of their hats for years” handy says “i’m expecting them to continue to do that” another analyst briefed on the technology greg wong of forward insights echoed the challenges but said crossbar definitely made an impression “it definitely looked interesting” he said the company has raised  million and reached the prototype stage with just  employees minassian estimates that commercial products based on the technology are about two years away they can’t come too soon for lu who says the fundamental idea for the technology came from an accidental discovery in 4 during a stint at harvard university before he joined the michigan faculty applying extra voltage to a tiny wire that contained amorphous silicon had some surprising effects he recalls “this is like a child of mine” says lu of crossbar “we are so close”  wall street journal pc magazine damon poeter august   startups rram tech promises tb memory for mobile devices a california startup called
