posts at dartmouth essex cepremap delta the oecd and the university of orl�ans his work has largely focussed on the interface between psychology sociology and economics in particular using job and life satisfaction scores and other psychological indices as proxy measures of utility the broad area is social interactions and social learning one research field has been that of relative utility or comparisons to others like you to others in the same household and to yourself in the past finding evidence of such comparisons with respect to both income and unemployment this work has spilled over into theoretical and empirical work on evidence for and the implications of following behaviour and learning from others actions recent work has involved collaboration with psychologists to map out habituation to life events such as job loss marriage and divorce using longrun panel data in addition direct measures of utility allow direct tests of popular models of the labour market in this spirit his work has looked at unemployment quits and labour market rents he joined iza as a research fellow in february    email  cv  homepage   iza world of labor article what makes a good job job
