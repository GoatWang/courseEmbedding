ratings idrs of ford motor company ford parent of ford credit and ford credit is bbb with a positive rating outlook slow economic recovery a slower recovery and potential for volatility could affect

performance fitch deems ford credit an adequate servicer to service c integrity of legal structure the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of ford credit would not
