groundwater and surface water in natural systems and the application of statistics to a variety of problems in hydrology during my career with the usgs this research effort has used a variety of approaches such as traditional field investigations using ion and isotope chemistry hydrologic modeling and novel application of statistical methodsbiographyresearch focus areas groundwatersurfacewater interactions including hydrology and geochemistry modeling climate and landuse change impacts on hydrologic systems flood frequency analysis and prediction assessing the effectiveness of nonpoint bestmanagement practices hydraulics of flow under ice current projects trout lake webb project the overall objective of this project is to understand processes underlying the responses of hydrological biological and chemical systems in the study area to climate variations and human activities the overall approach involves  detailed moisture accounting and isotope sampling of precipitation streamflow and the unsaturated and saturated zones of hillslope transects intersecting the stream  finescale sampling at the sedimentwater interface of trout lake and tributary streams  intensive sampling of carbonflux terms in various compartments of the carbon cycle  the use of a groundwater model to identify potential flow paths selected sampling for flow path verification and model refinement and detailed sampling along the final flow paths and  the use of a comprehensive hydrologic model to predict the response of the stream’s hydrologic and solute budgets to various stresses eg climate change development clear cutting  my specific research has focused on the hillslope processes the flowpath work and the hydrologic modeling effort  as site coordinator i oversee the overall management of the project and coordinate with outside groups to foster collaboration glri climate change the objectives of this project are to  build a model capable of predicting streamflow into the great lakes  run the model for current conditions and future climate predictions  provide streamflow estimates for glri restoration efforts and  build finescale models as insets from coarse scale model to look at small scale restoration efforts  my role on the project includes assisting with model development setting up automated calibrations evaluating the calibration results and running and interpreting the results from climatechange scenarios flood frequency characteristics in wisconsin the objectives of this project are to  operate a statewide network of creststage gages  develop improved regression equations for the entire state and  develop plans to better estimate flood frequency in urban areas  my role on the project includes coordination of the crestgage network  periodic evaluation of floodfrequency characteristics and development and publication of regional regressions  i plan to add several innovations to the program including addition of new basin characteristics using gis techniques evaluation and incorporation of trends into the analyses incorporation of measurement uncertainty into the regression analysis and investigation of floodfrequency techniques in urbanizing areas with nonstationary flood frequency characteristics  the project is well funded however a large portion of the budget is devoted to data
