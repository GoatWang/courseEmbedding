oddleifson thank you brendan our cfo rob cozzone is with us today and he will be speaking with us later good morning we continued our long term record of consistent financial performance with our solid quarter in q inclusive of ma expenses eps on a gaap basis came in at  per diluted share in second quarter excluding these costs net income rose to  million or  per diluted share which is comfortably ahead of both prior quarter and prior year results rob will provide added color on our results following my comments the strength of our underlying fundamentals was again on full display this quarter overall consumer and business household growth remained strong organic growth in our commercial loan portfolio was sustained as we continue to maintain healthy pipelines and actively participate in deal flow activity small business lending has been strong for us with balances up  in the past year on the consumer side both our home equity and residential portfolios continued their upward ascent as customers responded to our attractive offerings core deposits have more than kept pace with our loan growth and have now reached  of total deposits our investment management business continues to be real bellwether for us with strong revenue growth in q and assets managed under administration climbing to  billion astute balance sheet management by a treasured group is really paying off as demonstrated by a rising net interest margin credit quality remains in good shape as we have not wavered from our disciplined underwriting practices tightly  were tightly managing our expenses and that has a result in a further improvement of our operating efficiency ratio and capital levels continue to grow nicely tangible book value per share continues at steady  to steadily rise even while absorbing the goodwill from various acquisitions while were certainly encouraged by our financial performance were by no means sitting still on our indiscernible various funds to sustain our disciplined growth in may we closed on our acquisition of island bancorp parent of edgartown national bank this provides us with our first retail presence on marthas vineyard and is an excellent complement to our extensive cape cod footprint to say that the integration has gone smoothly is an understatement we have really hit the ground running there and initial customer responses exceeded all expectations and timing couldnt be better as the summer vacation season is in full swing and our  locations there are seeing robust activity weve also enjoined by local lenders and investment management professionals with indepth knowledge of this market on a broader basis we continue to track experienced talent to our ranks our rockland trust brand is resonating not just with customers but with banking professionals as well on last quarters conference call our bank president gerry nadeau spoke of our excellent  our excitement regarding the recent pending hires of seasoned commercial lenders whats noteworthy is that these lenders have joined us from considerably larger institutions which lends credence to the perceived attractiveness and potential of our franchise and company hires will help further advance our success in our commercial position similarly for just starting out commercial banking professionals our former commercial banker development program has placed colleagues into credit analyst portfolio manager and lender positions we also continue to garner favorable thirdparty recognition by reputable sources recently rockland trust was ranked by jd power as the highest in customer satisfaction with retail banking in new england were enormously proud of this and are so very appreciative of the hard work and dedication of all our rockland colleagues this is in conjunction with our very high boston globe best place to work rating our  human rights campaign rating and our favorable granite survey results relating to our small business and commercial customer engagement we also have a number of initiatives underway designed to continuously better a customer experience and improve operational efficiencies weve launched a completely redesigned rocklandtrustcom website that is much easier to navigate to date the average time spent on the site has increased  in the past year were also scrutinizing various line of business platforms to further streamline operations on the retail side our branch optimization effort remains in full swing whether its relocations transformations and plan to new opening pam frey our new head of retail and business bank is providing great leadership to our efforts here and we continue to refine our compliance and risk management efforts such as dfast stress testing in line with our growing asset size well in advance of reaching the required threshold for such efforts turning to the macro environment there is not much to add from our last call the national economy has continued its modest growth path and is fairly resilient thus far despite the political chaos in washington the recent moves by the fed to raise rates corroborates positive trends we also remain somewhat encouraged by the growing consensus to provide regulatory relief to smaller banks while the timing of such legislation remains elusive the local economic environment continues to be mostly positive consumer and business spending continued to increase at a moderate pace and although the state unemployment rate has ticked up a bit this year at  it remains below the national average finally the state business confidence index was  in june as reported by the associated industries of massachusetts remains among the highest levels since  so i think in conclusion its fair to say that the state of rockland trust franchise is quite good and weve all taken it for granted and will stay quite in our assumptions and approach and feel confident in our ability to sustain solid long term growth finally id like to acknowledge the contributions of longtime director morris sullivan who has reached the mandatory retirement age last month i benefited from morris advice and counsel and i wish he and his family the very best now ill turn it over to rob our cfo robert cozzone thank you chris and good morning as chris just described things came together especially well for us in the second quarter gaap net income of  million was relatively consistent with both the prior quarter and the same quarter of last year conversely though operating net income which is adjusted for merger charges at  million was up over  versus the first quarter and over  versus the prior year in addition operating earnings per share increased  over both prior periods to  in the second quarter strong earnings results translated into enhanced profitability on an operating basis second quarter return on assets return on equity and return on tangible equity improved to   and  respectively these results are a byproduct of maintaining our focus on strategic and financial priorities many of which are highly evident in second quarter results namely consistently maintaining asset sensitivity growing fee income businesses and realizing operating leverage ill discuss each of those further following in my balance sheet comments total assets grew to  billion as of june  primarily as a result of the island bancorp acquisition and continued steady loan growth the island acquisition which was closed and converted over the may  weekend added  million in loans and  million in primarily core deposits a complete schedule of the acquired assets and liabilities can be found in the press release as chris stated customer response have been simply terrific and deposit retention has exceeded all expectations thus far as anticipated the transaction was neutral to tangible book value per share and earnings accretion expectations remain intact our strategic regulatory and operational acquisition expertise has become a core competency that reduces integration and financial risk consistent with expectations total organic loan growth was almost  for the quarter and when including the impact of acquisitions loans were up  for the quarter and over  for the last  months our loan categories with the exception of commercial construction experienced organic growth during the quarter as very strong closing volumes offset relatively high payoffs with the complement of new very experienced commercial lenders quickly building pipelines loan growth is likely to accelerate through remainder of the year we have hired  commercial bankers since the beginning of the year and as of june  commercial loans approved for closing had increased to  million in addition consumer real estate portfolios continue to experience strong organic growth residential mortgage was up almost  annualized and home equity was up over  annualized healthy pipelines in both portfolios as of  bode well for q financings organic deposit growth was also notable for the quarter with demand deposits up  annualized and savings and interest checking categories up almost  core deposits now represent  of total deposits and as a result the cost of deposits was stable at  basis points in the second quarter despite rising short term rates the composition of our deposit book is a reflection of our intense focus on relationships and recognition on the superior customer service experience we strive to provide the benefit of our asset sensitivity is very evident in the results for the quarter the net interest margin was up  basis points to  and all loan categories experienced an increased yield versus the first quarter the net interest margin guidance we revised upward last quarter is likely still too conservative given results to date and the most recent rate increase confirmed during june although we expect more deposit pricing sensitivity as a result of the june fed funds increase that impact should also be a fraction of the benefit realized on the asset side in addition we have  million of  home loan bank advances maturing in the third quarter which we will replace at a much lower effective rate although somewhat anticipated due to seasonality total noninterest income increased by an impressive  compared to the first quarter included in the increase were strong interchange and atm fees driven by continued growth in households and core checking accounts a rebound in mortgage banking and loanlevel swap activity supported by a slight yield curve and higher investment management income related to seasonal tax prep fees along with strong growth in assets under administration as chris noted assets under administration ended the quarter at  billion a  increase versus june of  and new business activity was robust during the quarter significant growth in other fee income category related to leasing activities our  exchange business and a gain on the sale of one of our facilities and although some components of fee income remain difficult to predict growth in these businesses remains a focus for us noninterest expense including merger and acquisition charges increased  when compared to the first quarter despite the half quarter impact of the island acquisition combined salaries and benefits occupancy and equipment data processing and fdic assessment were essentially flat quarterover quarter the increase in other expense resulted from promotion of our jd power recognition consulting expense associated with efforts to improve the customer experience loan workout cost and recruiting expense related to the new hires previously mentioned good expense control has further benefited the efficiency ratio which was  on an operating basis a nice reflection of the operating leverage i referenced asset quality metrics remained solid however as a result of a bankruptcy filing we have chosen to charge off a portion of the commercial relationship we previously reserved for during the fourth quarter of  that same chargeoff benefited nonperforming asset levels which were down to  basis points of total assets at june  the  million of provision this quarter was primarily needed to support growth in terms of guidance for the remainder of the year we expect the following the addition of some seasoned lenders organic loan growth should accelerate to a mid to upper singledigit pace we expect deposit growth to be consistent with the second quarter growth and as suggested the net interest margin is expected to expand more than last guided and is now anticipated to be   basis points higher than the full year of  yearoveryear fee income is expected to increase at a low singledigit pace and noninterest expense will be closely managed and the core efficiency ratio should drop to the mids for yearend and finally as previously stated the tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to approximate to  incurred in the second quarter that concludes my comments chris christopher oddleifson thanks rob brendan were ready for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from mark fitzgibbon with sandler oneill partners mark fitzgibbon weve seen a number of other banks your size that have recently announced plans to kind of move into your markets so your core markets of boston thats offshore are you seeing any impact from that yet on loan deposit pricing christopher oddleifson no nothing imminent yet mark especially relative to the more recent entrants as you could imagine the boston market has been extremely competitive with all of the large players that we have to compete against in addition to many smaller players trying to get a foothold but our pricing held up nicely actually in the second quarter and we expect that to continue mark fitzgibbon okay and then secondly i wondered if you could update us if im not mistaken you guys were sort of systematically going through your branches and trying to upgrade and reduce the footprint size of those improved technology et cetera how is that going how many have you been able to convert and how many remain christopher oddleifson right so we have about  branches right now mark and our  we  its been a continuous process over the really last   years which on average are probably close relocate sort of    branches a year currently that pace over the last   years has accelerated during  i think we had  branches that we closed and in  we have branch relocation from burlington into a much better location where were building a brand new branch in a new location we have a de novo branch that were kind of building in newton we have a branch in hyannis where were moving down the street to a much sort of bigger and more accessible building that will have not only a branch but all our other lines of businesses and in terms of transformations our most recent transformation we moved from a traditional branch to a sort of a teller pod concept as mashpee down in the cape so far weve transformed about  or  branches into this new concept we  this is sort of the story thats never going to end mark i mean were going to be continuing asking ourselves how  what  where do we trend where do we add where do we combine the  and sort of what is the priority of the new markets we wanted to now move in so i expect  you can expect over the next number of years that well continue that and were also sort of asking ourselves what additional sort of branch technology do we want to introduce in fact there is a lot out there as youve probably read and seen we have to be careful and very judicious about what we can test but were on that path as well mark fitzgibbon okay and then lastly on the margin rob you had mentioned that the nim guidance that you had given previously is too conservative how are you thinking about the margin for the third quarter in terms of the magnitude of improvement christopher oddleifson well my guidance for the full year was  to  basis points of expansion versus full year  on the core margin i would expect the margin to expand into the third quarter because of the june increase i  based upon i think were all seeing out there there likely wont be another increase at least in fed funds until the end of the year probably december which means we would likely see the q net interest margin be flat to slightly down versus q because i expect more deposit pricing sensitivity to take some hold as these rate increases become evident to folks and has competition for deposits which is already happening to some extent intensifies so we have about  billion of assets that are tied to libor or fed funds or prime and then we have about another  million in change that is indexed to kind of a year home loan bank or year libor rate operator our next question comes from matthew breese with piper jaffray matthew breese i just wanted to make sure i had the core margin right this quarter what was  and im sorry if i missed it what was the accretable yield in there robert cozzone the accretable yield for the quarter was about  and thats been pretty consistent matt over the last couple of quarters prior to that and was averaging about  a quarter matthew breese okay and so the updated guidance from  to  to  to  basis points of expansion thats off the core margin robert cozzone thats off the core margin but that will be pretty close on both core and absolute actually matthew breese okay and then just going to your deposit competition commentary that perhaps could drive the margin actually down in q in what areas of your market is it most intense and in what product categories is it most intense robert cozzone yes so pretty consistently what i have said the last couple of quarters is the government banking business has been very competitive and so weve seen pricing go up on that portfolio to the tune of about  or  basis points and that began early on really in the fourth quarter of last year but our absolute cost of funds in that book of business is still fairly very attractive then we saw competition intensify and customers take notice in the larger commercial categories all those customers that were maintaining some excess funds in their business checking accounts they have been more sensitive to pricing and are seeing alternative pricing levels at other financial institutions just recently weve started to see a little bit more sensitivity in the kind of broader base deposit products on the business and consumer side so we have made some minor adjustments to a couple of product categories which we think will likely increase our cost of deposits in the third quarter by the tune of about  basis points matthew breese okay very helpful and then thinking about the island bancorp acquisition just curious could you remind us of what your outlook for cost saves was and how far along in the process of achieving those cost saves were at this point robert cozzone yes so in terms of achievement theyve all been achieved and our cost save estimates which are typically conservative for us out of the gate were around  one thing that is slightly different with edgartown this kind of early on as chris mentioned is that weve been successful in recruiting some new business folks from other local institutions so some of that expense including a commercial banker and some wealth management folks so that expense is not included in our original assumptions but neither is the benefit on the revenue side matthew breese okay and then lastly each quarter we march a little bit closer to the  billion threshold and i just wanted to get a sense for how far along in the expense process you are how much of the dfast expenses are currently baked in how much more do you think you have to go and then could you just remind us of what the interchange risk is robert cozzone yes so ill take the latter first as our interchange revenue grows obviously we have more at risk so now were kind of approaching the  million mark in terms of a modest interchange that is potentially at risk and that will likely continue to grow but what were doing as an aside here is aggressively looking at our credit card offerings to see  first of all we dont have a consumer credit card offering right now but we intend to get one and were hopeful that we can migrate some of that debit card activity not a substantial amount likely but some of that debit card activity to credit card offering in terms of the expense we continue to incrementally add for example this quarter we added a consumer risk specialist in our portfolio  credit portfolio analytics group that is a position that we probably wouldnt have added if we didnt think we were going to cross the  billion threshold and we have been doing that for last couple of years now so i wouldnt expect as ive said in the past to see a significant incremental increase in expense as we cross  billion but wed probably still have another  million to  million in annual spend that well be gradually incorporating as we approach  billion matthew breese i was mentioning our progress in dfast robert cozzone yes were making significant progress in preparing for a dfast submission our hope is that before the end of the year that were in a position to have kind of a test run matthew breese so that gives some indication on the infrastructure we have already in place christopher oddleifson right i mean that sounds like if youre ready for test run youre most of the way there robert cozzone thats right operator our next question comes from laurie hunsicker with compass point laurie hunsicker just a followup on matts question so without acquisition where do you think about the  billion cross being in terms of when you would actually run across that line christopher oddleifson well if you think about our organic growth rate being in the  to  range we probably are looking  years out if you throw an acquisition in there well it could be a lot sooner laurie hunsicker okay and i guess just going back to margin here i just want to make sure that i have this right so with orso million of accretable income thats roughly  basis points so your core nim is already at  versus you are at  for  again thats core distrophing at accretion income so youre already sitting at your very top of your upper guidance at potentially  basis points up robert cozzone well thats this current quarter we were lower than that last quarter so if you average the  we would be lower than  basis points and i expect to expand in the third quarter but fourth quarter is a little bit difficult to predict because of potential for deposit pricing sensitivity but i would not expect borrowing an additional fed funds increase a margin to expand further in the fourth quarter laurie hunsicker got it okay thats helpful okay and then just lastly looking at your income statement the other expense line of  million is there anything nonrecurring in that robert cozzone well weve mentioned the consulting fees associated with some projects and all those particular expenses will not be repeated we will have likely additional consulting associated with other products as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives but consulting as a whole i would expect to decline some of the recruitment expense and we have been very successful in recruiting some senior folks in the commercial banking side we also just added our head of retail pam frey that chris mentioned so those are expenses i would not expect to continue at the same level and then we have some other expenses which will decline into the third quarter more operating type expenses so as i said we do expect the efficiency ratio to improve throughout the remainder of the year laurie hunsicker okay and so then just to be clear something like a signing bonus is falling into that other other robert cozzone thats right laurie hunsicker okay and then as we think about the salary robert cozzone relocation expenses laurie hunsicker and relocation okay got it and so if you look at the salary and benefits line because obviously the hiring was in this quarter how should we been thinking about that just as we head into next quarter with the fully baked run rate on the salaries and benefits line with your new hires robert cozzone it will actually decline a little bit because of payroll taxes but obviously some of the hires will add that so i dont have a detailed number that id like to provide you but i would expect the whole thing salaries and benefits combined to decline for the remainder of the year operator operator instructions our next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw collyn gilbert just a few housekeeping questions rob whats the split between your  of your deposits how much is split between retail and commercial robert cozzone the way we categorize business deposits which includes small business we have about  billion in total business deposits and then  billion in total consumer deposits and then about  million in municipal deposits and then we have some small other deposits like the  exchange business collyn gilbert okay okay right thats helpful and then on your fee outlook maybe can you just talk in broader terms about what youre sort of seeing on  within the derivative activity and then mortgage banking i knew you gave specific fee guidance but just trying to understand some of the trends that youre seeing in each of those businesses as you look out for the next  to  months or so robert cozzone yes certainly so for lowlevel derivative income its a combination of our new business activity and then obviously customer demand for fixed rate i would suggest that our fee income going forward will be more  in that category will be more reflective of the absolute amount of loan closings that we do in a particular quarter so in the second quarter we had very high commercial closings one of our highest quarters ever and so the derivative income increased as a result i would not say that weve seen any change in business customers perspective regarding interest rates and so it doesnt seem like the rate environment is influencing their decision to swap or not swap its just new business coming in the door that wants a  or year fixed rate and they can get a better rate if they chose to swap so thats derivative income in terms of mortgage banking income we have actually seen in the last few quarters a higher percentage of our production go into portfolio and therefore benefit our mortgage banking income line item but you see that our growth in the residential book our organic growth is more than it has been historically there is significant demand probably not surprisingly in the greater boston market for jumbo product and jumbo product that there is not really an active competitive secondary market for and based upon our pipelines we expect that business to continue in the short term which means were selling a little bit less production than we have historically closer to probably  versus  or  in the past should that change should there be a more competitive market for jumbo or should we see more conforming production then i would expect obviously mortgage banking income to increase but i think the number for the second quarter is a pretty good number going forward we have built out our mortgage operation from an operational perspective quite nicely and were getting very favorable customer feedback and we have a nice complement of mortgage officers on staff right now collyn gilbert okay thats helpful and then what  do you have the breakout on what would be considered retailrelated cre within your cre book robert cozzone yes we put a pie chart together for the q which shows commercial buildings in total at  and then we have hotels and motels at about  strip malls at about  so within that commercial building category there is a portion of that which is retail related the majority of which is non  the vast vast majority nonbigbox retailers we have a pretty meaningful portfolio of stopping shop i mean a grocery store sorry and its  and convenient stores but not many other retail certainly not bigbox retailers collyn gilbert okay okay thats helpful and then i guess just one final question for  no actually another sort of detailed question rob thoughts on the provision kind of going forward its jumped a little bit just given some of the emergence of credits in the last two quarters but how do you see that trending as you look out for the rest of the year robert cozzone yes i mean credit quality aside from that one commercial credit that weve discussed the last couple of quarters has been exceptional all the trends look favorable from if you strip that one out again from a delinquency nonperforming asset perspective everything is trending favorably so we dont see anything on the horizon that would suggest anything other than maybe a periodic chargeoff of any meaningful size so were feeling very good about credit quality collyn gilbert okay okay thats helpful and then finally chris just if you could comment on what youre seeing out there in terms of ma in the market and just sort of what your appetite is and i mean if  im sure it probably hasnt changed but maybe more of what the landscape looks like here in the last few months or so christopher oddleifson well i cant talk about sort of detail but i will say that there was a large enhancement in our marketplace that im sure were having were always desirous to be at the table our currency is strong and as in the past ill just emphasize that were really sort of disciplined and focused probably on some of these things i mean the  we need to be sort of thinking about the long term in terms of the other sort of banks that may raise their hands there not as many of these in the past but theres certainly a number that i imagine that the trend is not going to come to a abrupt halt but over time that some of these banks are going to raise their hand they want to talk about a potential merger and were ready willing and able to have that conversation our strategy for ma is tightly focused i mean historically i mean we really believe in just being opportunistic but also that we believe a major sort of economic center of new england is right here where were so emanating in a semicircle around boston and wed like to sort of put our primary focus on that not that if theres an interesting bank that comes up a little bit further way we wouldnt take a look at it or think about it but we would  i mean ideally wed like to sort of continue our march which is fill on our market and move out in the directions of northwest and  or southeast operator operator instructions this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to christopher oddleifson for any closing remarks
