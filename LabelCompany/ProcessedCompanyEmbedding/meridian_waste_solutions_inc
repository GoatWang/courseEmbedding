businessaccesswireapril  reblogsharetweetshareoffers viable economic use of renewable carbonmilton ga  accesswire  april    meridian waste solutions inc nasdaq mrdn meridian waste or the company a vertically integrated nonhazardous solid waste services company today announced the signing of a nonbinding term sheet with advanced lignin biocomposites llc advanced ligninunder the terms of the agreement a joint venture would be formed between meridian waste meridian innovations and advanced lignin to develop advanced lignins biomaterials technology portfolioadvanced lignin recognizes that while most consumers desire to purchase environmentally friendly products and plastics in particular they have trouble justifying the high cost and the often substandard performance delivered by these products advanced lignin believes it has a viable pathway to produce low cost high performance materials from lignin an otherwise undervalued byproduct of the pulp and paper and cellulosic biorefining industries lignin is one of the most abundant organic polymers on earth and is readily available for recovery advanced lignin trusts that it can recover and convert lignin into higher value and better performing materials more cost effectively than those methods previously availablewhile advanced lignin plans to use its advanced methods to more cost effectively produce many different materials including adhesives renewable fuels and carbon fiber its initial focus will be to produce high performance green plastics advanced lignin has identified a pathway to produce green ligninbased plastics that could ideally prove to cost less and outperform many plastics made from nonrenewable resources such as petroleumwhile paper mills and cellulosic fuel providers generally burn the lignin contained in their byproduct stream as a source of green plant based energy there is a greener and more valuable use for that lignin as a rule of thumb it takes about two pounds of petroleum to produce only one pound of plastic whereas advanced lignin believes that it can displace about one pound of this petroleum derived plastic with only about one pound of lignin and as a result dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of plastic productsplants take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and essentially strip out and store carbon in the plant and release oxygen back to the atmosphere plants are therefore referred to as a carbon sink as they remove and store a significant amount of carbon from the atmosphere carbon dioxide is the most widely known greenhouse gas in the earths atmosphere and environmentalists continue to seek pathways to reduce the amount generated especially from that of nonrenewable sourceswhile there is an estimated  billion tonnes of crude oil underneath the earths surface diminishing at a rate of about  billion tonnes per year there lies about  billion tonnes of rapidly renewable lignin sitting on the earths surface awaiting harvest use and reuse advanced lignin believes that its technologies will greatly contribute to positive economic and environmental success by more effectively recycling and reusing this naturally regenerating source of carbonthe solid waste industry has a responsibility to identify and maximize economic benefit from the materials it collects for processing andor disposal stated jeff cosman ceo of meridian waste the plastic recycling platform has been our industrys staple in its effort to contribute to environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions while meridian waste will continue to support these traditional recycling efforts we believe that there are additional pathways that can achieve significantly greater results in terms of sustainability and economic benefit our new joint venture will explore one such pathway as it essentially participates and contributes to natures most efficient and ongoing carbon capture and recycling activities we look forward to what lies ahead for our company and shareholders and will continue to announce our progress on an ongoing basisabout meridian waste solutions incmeridian waste solutions inc nasdaq mrdn is a company defined by our commitment to
