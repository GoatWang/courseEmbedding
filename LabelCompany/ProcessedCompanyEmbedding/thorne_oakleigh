elearning eeducation designated to be  understood to include all forms of learning  a definition from michael kerres in which electronic or digital media for the presentation and distribution of learning materials and  or to support the use of interpersonal communication for elearning can be found as synonyms terms such as online learning online learning telelearning multimedia based learning computeraided learning computerbased training including open and distancelearning   created for oakleigh thorne iv the machine was probably the first study in  by italian engineer agostino ramelli developed when he for the king of france invented a leserad through this leserad recourse was made possible in various literature sources without running back and forth halcyon skinner  filed the first patent on his machine learning until   additional patent applications for similar exercise equipment have been confirmed  bf skinner developed and james g holland linear learning programs according to the law of operant conditioning skinner hollandsches tutorial thus were the learners the teaching material in small steps frames presented each followed by questions  norman crowder invented the branched learning programs in which an errordependent presentation of the teaching content was made possible this enabled the learning process to be customized in  started the nsf national science foundation to prove in the united states two major projects with the aim of the efficiency of computerassisted instruction for teaching for one these were the project ticcit english timeshared interactive computer controlled information television and the second to the plato project english programmed logic for automated teaching operations in conclusion these two studies could the nsf confirm the computeraided instruction as an effective tool were developed in germany since  teaching machines but not by ideas of skinner  holland even after those of crowder the learning programs that were developed in germany were used the training group examples of such machines are teaching the geromat iii had to specify in which three students the correct answer to the subject matter to come forward and the tutorial bachelor were able to learn in this program to  people at a time it was possible ramifications and three different difficulty levels adjustable in the early s there were a number of research and development projects for computerassisted instruction in addition to use in schools has developed another focus the workbased training for example interactive videos have been used to conduct training for sales staff  the agency developed mit together with their customers hertie one of the first computerbased training cbt and the appropriate hardware videomit  since the early s the simulations with significant research aspects since the late s the elearning experienced by the spread of the internet a strong upswing the term elearning has been established since the mids the federal ministry for education and research has since launched several initiatives this includes initiatives such as the schools online new media in education and notebook university   created for oakleigh thorne iv under elearning refers to the teaching and learning through various electronic media in addition to the expression of elearning there are various other expressions such as the computerbased learning online learning multimedia learning etc has since the definition of elearning yet yielded no universally accepted definition they tried to elearning to be described by different facets multimediality  multicodalität multimodality and interactivity  multimediality multimedia nature the various possibilities of media can be acquired through knowledge dar different media can be for example books video player audio player computer audio books ebooks electronic books electures online held lectures  multicodalität the term is meant multicodalität that the information can be encoded differently in the various media which is also dependent on the nature of the medium thus in books of course show animated images other types of codes would be images texts and in case of computer hypertext crossreferences crosslinked text animations and simulations  the difference between animations and simulations is that in a simulation the user has greater control over the event when an animation is basically to create animated images while it is possible for a simulation such as conducting various virtual experiments in the digital environment multimodality under multimodality refers to the different ways to absorb information about the sensory modalities in general these are auditory or visual sensations other modalities such as smell taste and touch play in elearning not have a role  interactivity when something is called interactively if the user is permitted to exercise various control and intervention options grissom et al  cit after  have proposed a sixstep interaction hierarchy this is from no interaction to presentation including feedback and discussion as the highest form of interaction   created for oakleigh thorne iv elearning and related technology elearning can be based on very different technologies and are implemented in different teaching scenarios are frequently discussed the following options web and computer based training applications the term cbt computer based training is the work with educational software educational software which the learner can be used flexibly in time and space and where learners are not in direct contact with the teachers and other learners these programs multimedia learning content such as animation or video documents include and are usually distributed on cdrom or dvd when cbt is one nichttutorielle primary form of elearning in which the selfstudy is important and the communication if ever occurs in an asynchronous manner cbt has been around since the s for older computer assisted learning systems there are also a variety of other names for example are cat english computer aided teaching cai computer aided instruction and computer assisted instruction cbi computer based instruction cal cul computer assisted learning computer aided learning computer assisted learning rsp  cuu computer assisted education or computerassisted instruction cbl computer based learning  computerbased learning cbe computer based education cgu computeraided instruction rgu computerassisted instruction or cuív computerassisted interactive video other common names in german the terms courseware or courseware  created for oakleigh thorne iv the basic building block of networkbased learning opportunities is the socalled wbt web based training  a further development of cbt these learning units are not distributed on a disk but accessed by a web server online via the internet or an intranet the embedding into the net offers many more possibilities for communication and interaction of the learner with the teacher  tutor or his classmates thus mail news chats and discussion forums associated with the wbt and audio and video signals are streamed live  a further development of the wbt towards a more communicative use the learning platform this supports various types of communication such as chat and forums in order to encourage the users of the learning platform for direct exchange and apply the learned zbbabbel software authoring systems authoring systems are development tools for creating digital learning opportunities its purpose is to create content for a learning opportunity and prepare they offer teachers the opportunity for example content documents for the web or a cdrom developed it is easy to use authoring tools authors so that no more knowledge of html xml and internet need to possess these simple systems are useful when one wants to produce learning materials for a particular purpose that does not intend to reuse the content for other courses later if you use once again produced educational content for different courses would like to recommend more powerful authoring tools this can work with xml technologies and be connected to a document management system can be roughly divided into authoring systems editors for media html pages graphics animations simulations audio and video clips exercises editors for learning material sites and editors for course navigation script or compilation of the toc some authoring systems integrate all these functions this means these authoring systems allow the creator of online courses a variety of media to integrate into a teaching unit to create professional dynamic and interactive learning content  created for oakleigh thorne iv the course navigation and control is offered in some authoring systems by more or less exposed programming or scripting language to the script can be defined a large portion of the available authoring systems is designed to establish prices for fixed computers and laptops some programs allow it but also learning programs specifically for other systems  prepare  such as pdas and cell phones there are a variety of media and file types such as text graphics video and audio support special authoring systems are tuned to socalled learning environments and allow it to create exclusive content for these learning systems there are also authoring tools the specific standards such as scorm aicc and ims content packaging support this content authoring tools can generate for all learning environments that support these standards the easier to use an authoring system is the more limited one usually in shaping the content systems that can be a creator of great creative freedoms are often very complex and require a longer training period simulations simulations are models which reflect significant characteristics of the real world trying to get students through free or deliberate experimentation or observation of knowledge about structural or functional properties of the original to convey complicated issues and processes of reality can be so simplified and reduced to the essentials are presented especially when real experiments are too expensive or too dangerous videoconferencing  distance education the video conference creates virtual classrooms by geographically distributed students and lecturers can communicate with each other to be known as the variant of distance education elearning is primarily characterized by the transmission of picture and sound it allows a classroom teaching style communication between teachers and learners who can rely on verbal statements as well as to gestures and facial expressions is limited by the teleteaching the relatively high technical requirements with increasing bandwidth of internet connections develop from this new technology evideo formats  created for oakleigh thorne iv learning management systems see main article learning platform as a learning platform english learning management system lms systems are known that can support the online and  or classroom courses to complete or parts of the work flow of the event management of accounting processes teaching and learning processes to the resource administration the duties of an lms may include in particular planning these include the design and assembly of online courses  seminars the creation of personalized curricula based on placement tests or have already completed training units and creating learning profiles for work groups or the whole workforce registration the online registration for all courses offered often with an integrated interface to an ecommerce system for example to order documents provision of course materials the stored contents are held in different delivery forms eg for classroom training and wbt certification the recording of training events courses and qualifications skill profiles eskills measuring success measuring the use and management of results in some lms one of teachers and administrative space is included which can subsequently exchange events and persons and report any scheduling conflicts these functions can be quite extensive such as integrated arbeitszeiturlaubsverwaltung the teacher storage of spatial data number of places available resources such as projectors or overhead projectors comprehensive reports can later be created for example etc from the existing data room occupancy data lesson plans or learning progress of individuals  created for oakleigh thorne iv learning content management systems the task of an lcms learning content management system is creating reusing retrieving reworking and delivery of learning content content the content is often held in a central repository in the form of reusable learning objects rlos objects can be referenced by several different courses so that in case of an adaptation only a single change necessary to bring all the incarnations of the current state the lcms has as opposed to authoring tools via a user administration which allows different people and groups to assign certain rights so that for example for subjectspecific experts media designers project administrators each have different access functions defined  can be realized a multiuser functionality allows you to manage concurrent access so that it can not happen that two users can simultaneously make contradictory changes to the same object lcms continues to have a rule about a version control that allows to track changes made one of the most important tasks of an lcms is to support reusable learning objects rlos the aim is to prevent unwanted redundancies and conflicting information widely  created for oakleigh thorne iv content catalogues contentcatalogs support the exchange of learning objects  from full courses to raw materials provider can specify supply conditions requests are documented and if charged these catalogs are often very specific to a particular school level universities here oriented see also contentsharing as a form of elearning digital learning games see digital learning game forms of elearning virtual education virtual education designated teaching that is conducted primarily over the internet and does not involve significant amounts of classroom teaching the spectrum of presentation forms of virtual teaching include webassisted courses textbook hypertext courses eg text books multimedia animations and exercises videobased courses eg lectures including slides or audiobased courses or podcasts because virtual teaching as opposed to classroom teaching and blended learning is little opportunity for direct interaction teachers and students use electronic media to communicate frequently such as chat rooms discussion forums voice mail or email virtual education plays a growing role in the context of the introduction of further fineline masters degree programs at many universities blended learning if the benefits of classroom events are associated with elearning it is called blended learning blended learning dt blended learning combines both forms of learning in a common syllabus curriculum blended learning is especially used when addition of pure knowledge and the practical implementation is to be trained eg in health and safety content sharing there are now websites that allow units to share learning such initiatives exist as a commercial or free offers an example of a commercial initiative is unidogde  there are monetary incentives for the preparation of learning content set this should increase the quality of the published notes flashcards or summaries as a typical example of a noncommercial forum for example may the student council forum for business engineering at the university of duisburgessen used wiingsdu even with such local initiatives often shows a high demand such as the documented numbers of accesspoint wiings you an example learning communities groups have the same goals and  or professional interests can be built on an information and communication system a common knowledge base each member of this learning community can bring their own knowledge and thus expands the knowledge base on common learning processes and adapted  site for oakleigh thorne iv computersupported cooperative learning computersupported cooperative learning cscl describes approaches to learning which is supported collaborative learning through the use of computerized information and communication systems web based collaboration the term webbased collaboration describes the collaboration in a learning task of a group of people over the internet virtual classroom virtual classroom the virtual classroom is the internet as a communication medium to connect geographically separated students and teachers together the virtual classroom enables therefore a synchronous form of learning as an extreme form of the teleteaching is considered white board a whiteboard is like a blackboard or a flipchart users have the ability to create a network to share and view sketches these are both zeichenmal and text tools available business tv business tv is a precisely tailored to the television audience business tv is a very effective way to stimulate a group employees suppliers and customers to learn  site for oakleigh thorne iv rapid elearning see rapid elearning microlearning at the microlearning is about learning in many small units of learning and in short steps often via web or phone modular visualization process content as part of elearning this is a visual representation of teaching units with the aim of a cognitive process  which can lead to new knowledge  prepare step by step into film image text and sound d infrastructure platforms increasingly d infrastructure platforms such as second life and twinity gain in importance for elearning applications due to the nature of these virtual worlds experience a very high degree of immersion is achieved this is intended to a correspondingly higher learning efficiency because games are growing together and learning through simulated worlds of experience you can now immerse themselves in these situations and experience a high level of immersion virtual reality is achieved inter alia when the user enters a strong identification with his avatar and the user feels as part of the world thus the term is extended by the concept of action learning elearning action another considerable advantage by networking team in virtual worlds is to see where teams have to play perfectly together for example in actions by the police fire ambulance etc the parties may now log in from anywhere in the world and scenarios on a regular basis in a virtual world through play particular orientation trainings can be done here in more frequent and regular intervals which can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of such operations foreign language learning according to an employee of linden lab the most common form of education in second life  advantages and disadvantages of elearning a few years ago elearning was seen as the form of education for the st century meanwhile it is believed that elearning can not replace the traditional forms of education it can be seen only as a useful aid in the learning process by combining different forms of media placement hybrid learning arrangements learning can be optimized in particular people who prefer to use the pc and the internet can read books take a lot of elearning learning content to better prepare or already known and additional interactive content other advantages of elearning are no doubt the economic aspects learners are spatially and temporally independent the procurement of learning materials can also be done independently from their physical presence thanks to pc and internet distribution of larger aspects of information is feasible especially these economic benefits are not to be underestimated because lifelong learning often means parttime learning and there is flexibility in terms of place and time especially important media are crucial to only a small part of the learning success and therefore can not be spoken of by per se efficient learning elearning come together only when a number of factors that can be successful elearning note some are insights from media education or media education  site for oakleigh thorne iv on the basis of the results of media didactics advantages are inter alia that courses as opposed to traditional teaching tools are interactive abstract content through simulations can be made visible the traditional linear thinking and learning concepts are broken up and more flexible networklike concepts can be realized learning control can be individualized and can vary repetitionsaufgaben courses can be adapted to specific needs learning with operational knowledge management knowledge management can be connected can be worked asynchronously time and can be learned anywhere can be learned just in time integrated work process can be learned documentation and repetitions are easier learning objects are reusable audio and video documents are easy to integrate an individual learning depending on prior knowledge pace sequence of learning content is possible different prior knowledge is better balanced recording channels available for each type of learner reading audio video animation  c and that no exposure over other players takes place in knowledge gaps disadvantages are seen among other things that learners must learn with the various forms of publication media deal too few teachers in elearning work in many areas but not all the technology and technicians to determine the market the presentation of learning content often is not determined by technical and educational factors didactics in creating an elearning solution is often not considered screen for almost all people learn more tiring than learning from the paper selfdiscipline and independent learning skills are needed reduced social interactions with teachers  coaches and players make the experience more difficult and therefore often remain unresolved issues statements by teachers  trainers are reduced and the knowledge itself must be developed and that the additional learning during leisure or at work is perceived as annoying  site for oakleigh thorne iv current approaches therefore combine elearning with classroom teaching ie the personal mediation these approaches operate under the concept of hybrid learning arrangements or blended learning the aim of these approaches is to combine the benefits of classroom teaching with those of mediabased learning and to avoid both disadvantages while many elearning concepts keep still to linear knowledge as they are known from books and other traditional teaching tools that allow modern elearning systems flexible and adaptive structures that enter with a certain human touch to the learner such systems are based on networklike structures for dialogue the advantage of such elearning models is that a much higher interactivity is about the whole learning process often this reduces the need for blended learning unless practical skills  such as equipment operations or social skills  are the subject of learning activity the disadvantage is the increased complexity in the need to respond to variable outcomes of learning control and the need to implement a number of learning indepth and exkurspfade that may be followed in practice only a few students ever motivation for the use of elearning the rapid technological development in the computer industry and the associated new methods for the design of content especially hypertext and multimedia promoted the development of socalled elearning programs in a large scale in the technical discussion you are still not agreed whether elearning in the sense of email ebusiness etc for learning on the internet or as a modern synonym for cul computerassisted learning should be used today the tendency is even more likely to elearning to be regarded as mere supplements to classroom teaching as part of the socalled blended learning moreover attempts by various actors to give more weight to the actual learning content there used to be the technological aspects in the foreground  site for oakleigh thorne iv elearning from the perspective of the introduction in organizations successful implementation of elearning requires for each institution a series of accompanying measures survey of learning conditions and needs adaptation of curricula changes in work processes so that time and incentives for workplace learning are given adjustment of job descriptions and compensation systems multidisciplinary teams educationists engineers content experts are set up either inside the organization rsp appropriate collaborations are set up and contents are stored in interchangeable formats and all participants will be made available for use robin mason with models of online courses proposed an approach such as elearning can be introduced in stages content  support model information model static web site online activities take a maximum of  of class time the internet is for support activities research use of email download materials are available wraparound model asynchronous discussion forum relation to nonwebweb activity up to  some lessons with traditional materials eg books and interactive learning environment with additional resources in the internet example work plans exercises and tasks and common web activities discussion groups group work must be called center of activity however remains the facetoface teaching integrated model  elearning the core of all activities taking place on the internet particularly collaborative activities and exchange of materials if elearning is to be operated effectively and efficiently it requires in relation to the curricula of certain modifications in particular it is important to develop key skills such as media information and computer literacy these key skills are ideally taught with the help of information and communication technology tool character gilly salmon salmon  distinguishes five stages of the learning process on the way from beginner to elearning elearning professional access and motivation in this stage will be set up their own computer environment for future elearning and customized this refers both to a possible need for physical installation of hardware and software but also on the structure of personal motivation to use elearning and want to use often at this stage there is still no access to the learning platform  tutors  other students assistance must be made through other media phone  in person especially in this phase are particularly frustrating and difficult problems and can quickly lead to termination of the entire process online socializing once technical and motivational hurdles are overcome is now elearning to the learner in principle fully available however at this point many features are still unclear and need to be explored by the learner  the personal benefits and applicability of the personal learning process initially remain closed exchange of information it begins a lively and active exchange of information in the new medium the functions of the software you are using more and more in this phase however does appear on problems concerning the handling of the new and large data set ie it comes to classification archiving searching sorting and structuring knowledge construction participants use elearning more and more free and flexible it is not only the use of the material offered online but now a more intense cooperative learning among participants the participants learn from and with each other now selforganization in this phase the participants not only for the content of the learning process but also more responsibility for their organization ie it is a matter of learning organization and a division of roles within the participating groups this phase is not meaningful to all elearning processes  site for oakleigh thorne iv elearning in staff development companies could reduce their spending on staff development by means of elearning dramatically in addition process and error costs by qualified personnel lower error rates and increasing
