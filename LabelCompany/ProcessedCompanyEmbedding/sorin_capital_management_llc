calling for positive action to close value gap jun    et from sorin capital management llc stamford conn june   prnewswire  today sorin capital management an investment management firm specializing in us real estate related securities released a public letter to michael a happel chief executive officer and president of new york reit inc nyse nyrt recommending four measures to improve shareholder value the full text of the letter can be found below june   michael a happel chief executive officer and president new york reit inc  park avenue new york new york  cc  board of directors dear michael thank you for meeting with sorin capital management to discuss our concerns regarding the substantial gap that has developed between the common stock share price of new york reit inc the company and the underlying value of the companys assets  unfortunately we have seen a continuing deterioration of the stock price over the past six months with the companys shares currently trading at a greater than  discount to our estimate of fair value  this gap has increased in the past  days with the companys announcement of two news items first the decision of the board of directors the board to suspend the formal process to evaluate strategic options for the company the strategic alternatives process and second the resignation of the companys chief financial officer and chief operating officer gregory w sullivan as one of the companys larger shareholders we are unhappy with the current situation  we are concerned that i the board may not have adequately pursued bids or indications of interest presented during the strategic alternatives process ii the companys management team does not have a realistic and comprehensive plan for closing the value gap and iii the companys close relationship with ar capital is impeding management and the board from taking appropriate steps to address the issue  at the very least we cannot help but think the companys association with ar capital is exacerbating the poor share price performance and that completely disassociating from ar capital would make sense  we question the boards decision to suspend the strategic alternatives process and if the alternatives presented were unacceptable why management has yet to put forth a robust plan to deliver comparable if not greater value to shareholders in a comparable timeframe   in announcing the suspension of the strategic alternatives process management stated the company would actively pursue strategies to enhance longterm shareholder value as part of its ordinary course of business but provided no specifics at that time  although the company has proposed four initiatives in its june  investor presentation none of them in our view is likely to provide the catalyst needed to spark real measurable value creation  together these announced initiatives do not constitute a thorough and wellthoughtout plan but rather a list of halfsteps and normal business activities  we believe new york city commercial real estate assets are trading at historic highs and that there is ample liquidity in the market  yet despite these favorable conditions and the companys attractive portfolio of new york city properties the companys stock price does not represent their fair value and is lagging its peers by a wide margin  we believe that there is no better way to accurately value the company than through a widely marketed sales process and there is no better time to do that than now in our view the markets negative reaction to the suspension of the strategic alternatives process the lack of a clear plan for value creation and the resignation of the companys cfocoo has been compounded by managements and the boards extensive relationships with ar capital  not only is the executive chairman of the company also the cofounder of ar capital but the companys public filings indicate that the boards three independent members currently hold andor have previously held several other directorships with ar capital related entities  we have concerns that the potential conflicts of interest inherent in these interconnected relationships at the board level in addition to the overlapping management among various ar capital entities may be hindering the board and management from taking positive action in the best interests of company shareholders as we have discussed we believe that continuing to actively pursue strategic alternatives such as a sale of the company or material assets is the most direct path to unlocking value for the shareholders  to that end we recommend the following reengage barclays capital along with another wellrecognized firm that specializes in real estate capital markets to jointly pursue strategic alternatives for the company increase the independence of the board by adding members that are truly independent of company management and the ar capital organization sever all ties with ar capital and its affiliates including american realty capital new york city reit inc sell the companys noncore assets as outlined in the june  investor presentation and distribute proceeds to shareholders as a stock buyback or special dividend  of course asset sales should be broadly marketed and transactions should exclude all entities affiliated with ar capital or its principals officers or directors we intend this letter as a constructive communication but more of the same from the board and management is neither a strategic alternative nor what shareholders should expect or deserve  we urge you to pursue the initiatives outlined above and as always stand ready to meet with the board and its representatives to discuss our concerns sincerely james j higgins managing member sorin capital management llc about sorin
