prasant desai esq of brookline ma posting as who are you posting as     post tribute post privately david hildner on dec   my friend robert lauer has said it all walker was always an integral part of my beautiful memories of visits to el paso for the siglo de oro drama festival and symposium but i didnt realize until after his retirement how devoted he was to the world of theater even beyond his chamizal duties he gave of himself so unstintingly we will miss him very much david hildner uwmadison wesley johnson on dec   i never really ever new walker but as a little boy  i would often look at the book that his mother wrote about the reid kids at their grandfathers farm on hwy p in oconomowoc every time i go past the farm i have to think about him wesley johnson oconomowoc a robert lauer on dec   walker reid lives in the memories of those of us who knew him i first met walker at the chamizal national memorial in el paso tx he had am imposing yet kind presence he was efficient benevolent cultured he had a great sense of humor i was often daunted by his ability to remember names and numbers also i noticed that he would speak well of others yet i never heard him speak ill of anyone walker had the capacity to bring people together at odds with each other in that respect he was a true diplomat did i mention he was a great storyteller to this day at the chamizal during the annual siglo de oro festival his name pops up and someone sometime during the event will recall walkers final words to the theater audience after presenting a company a command accompanied with a smile «favor de divertirse» please enjoy walker will be missed he will also be remembered and continue to be much loved by all peace from a robert lauer videos there are no videos to display photos add a
