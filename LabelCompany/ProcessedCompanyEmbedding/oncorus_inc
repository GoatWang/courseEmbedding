different things how do you launch a new product in the market by margarita hakobyan margarita hakobyan is a businesswoman and an entrepreneur that is addicted to creating as an owner of several businesses she brings a wide range of education and experience including business strategy business ethics and leadership margahakobyan founder solopreneursmargahakobyan write a comment credit getty images product launch is an intense stressful time but careful planning can help reduce your stress and give your team a solid plan to help manage the intensity if you cover these four issues early in the planning process your launch will be easier to manage and less frustrating overall it will also have better odds of success leading to a better company position over time  know your audience when you think of the audience for your product how specific is it do you have a very general idea of who your customer base is  women for example or small business owners  or have you drilled down deep into your customer profile the most successful products are carefully targeted in very specific ways at very specific customers take the example of cell phones while nearly everyone in the world has a cellphone these mobile phones were initially a very niche product marketed towards traveling businesspeople who needed a way to contact the office from the road part of building your launch is figuring out exactly who your audience is you should know demographic details about your customer profile age gender marital status occupation hobbies as well as habitual information where do they get their news what is their favorite publication how do they spend their free time knowing these details will help you understand where to find your customer and how to connect with them  solve the right problem every product on the market needs to solve a problem the easiest products to market exist where customers know they have a problem and are seeking a solution some products need to convince customers they have a problem and that the product is a solution these products have an uphill climb towards success the better you know your audience the easier it will be to identify their problems in a language they understand for example targeting a baby product that entertains a very young baby and gives parents a chance to set them down will not be as useful to a parent who intensely values baby wearing and intensive skintoskin time there are other parents however who will be extremely appreciative of your product the key is knowing where to find them identify exactly what problem you are solving and make sure that your audience agrees that the problem exists before you get too far into your launch  careful positioning against your competition every product has competition even industries that are being disrupted are competing against the status quo to successfully launch a product you need to know what your business is working against if your customers were not using your products or services whose would they be using sometimes the answer is another company offering the same services in this case your position points might revolve around pricing value adds and service capabilities sometimes the answer is another product in the same class for example each movie that comes out competes not just against other movies but against all the other things people do with their free time to convince people to go see the newest blockbuster thriller studios must convince their potential audience that the movie is worth their time when you know your audience and you understand what problem you are solving positioning your product will be easier and more accurate you will better understand where to place ads what content will be helpful in marketing and how to connect with your audience if you find yourself unsure of how to accomplish these tasks returning to the basic ideas of audience and problem will often narrow your position  feedback one of the most key elements of a product launch is getting feedback from your customers you can do all of the theoretical assessments on your audience before launch but nothing will compare to real feedback from your actual customers while not every piece of feedback you receive needs to be acted upon immediately watching customer feedback for trends and patterns will help you identify the next stage of your product evolution during the actual launch its important to course correct as necessary but not to try and implement new features or perfect the product prior to launch seth godin always talks about the importance of shipping and how our fear of shipping gets in the way of actually getting a business off the ground if customers are providing feedback about the service theyre receiving or the actual functionality of your product or service you will probably need to fix this as soon as possible if customers are asking for more functionality additional benefits or more perks you will probably have more success tracking these requests for later implementation product launch is a stressful time for a business owner or entrepreneur but it is not the end point of the business structure by planning for a product launch you can make sure that your launch is as successful as possible and modify the plan as necessary to continue into the next phase of development what advice would you offer to a company planning its first product launch the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on mar
