jefferson patterson and the firm was renamed the national cash register company patterson formed ncr into one of the first modern american companies by introducing new aggressive sales methods and business techniques he established the first sales training school in  and introduced a comprehensive social welfare program for his factory workers other significant figures in the early history of the company were charles f kettering thomas j watson sr and edward a deeds deeds and kettering went on to found dayton engineering laboratories company which later became delco products division of general motors watson eventually worked his way up to general sales manager at an uninspiring sales meeting watson interrupted saying the trouble with every one of us is that we dont think enough we dont get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads watson then wrote think on the easel signs with this motto were erected in factory buildings sales offices and club rooms during the mids think later became a widely known symbol of ibm patterson fired watson in  kettering designed the first cash register powered by an electric motor in  within a few years he

when john h patterson and his brother took over the company cash registers were expensive  usd and only about a dozen of rittys incorruptible cashier machines were in use there was little demand for the expensive device but patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks he created a sales team known as the american selling force which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script the ncr primer the philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery sales demonstrations were set up in hotels away from the distractions of the buyers business depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash the sale prospect was described as the pp or probable purchaser once initial objections were swept aside and the pp admitted to internal theft losses the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams the deal was sealed with a  cent cigar expansionedit ncr expanded quickly and became multinational in  between  and  it acquired a number of smaller cash register companies by  it had sold one million machines and grown to almost  employees combined with rigorous legal attacks pattersons methods enabled the company to fight off bankruptcy buyout over  of its early competitors and achieve control of  of the us market in  the company was found guilty of violating the sherman antitrust act patterson deeds watson and  other ncr executives and managers were convicted of illegal anticompetitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of patterson and watson to help those affected by the dayton ohio floods of  but efforts to have them pardoned by president woodrow wilson were unsuccessful however their convictions were overturned on appeal in  on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted wwii

business techniques he established the first sales training school in  and introduced a comprehensive social welfare program for his factory workers other significant figures in the early history of the company were charles f kettering thomas j watson sr and edward a deeds deeds and kettering went on to found dayton engineering laboratories company which later became delco products division of general motors watson eventually worked his way up to general sales manager at an uninspiring sales meeting watson interrupted saying the trouble with every one of us is that we dont think enough we dont get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads watson then wrote think on the easel signs with this motto were erected in factory buildings sales offices and club

when john h patterson and his brother took over the company cash registers were expensive  usd and only about a dozen of rittys incorruptible cashier machines were in use there was little demand for the expensive device but patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks he created a sales team known as the american selling force which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script the ncr primer the philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery sales demonstrations were set up in hotels away from the distractions of the buyers business depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash the sale prospect was described as the pp or probable purchaser once initial objections were swept aside and the pp admitted to internal theft losses the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams the deal was sealed with a  cent cigar

employees combined with rigorous legal attacks pattersons methods enabled the company to fight off bankruptcy buyout over  of its early competitors and achieve control of  of the us market in  the company was found guilty of violating the sherman antitrust act patterson deeds watson and  other ncr executives and managers were convicted of illegal anticompetitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of patterson and watson to help those affected by the dayton ohio floods of  but efforts to have them pardoned by president woodrow wilson were unsuccessful however their convictions were overturned on appeal in  on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted wwii

these headwinds we drove solid performance across our businesses and remain on target to achieve our full year goals for earnings and free cash flow our growing  billion software and cloud business global diversity of industries and markets along with great employees and partners are the keys to ncrs success turning now to slide number three q revenue was down  on an asreported basis this was lower than the revenue guidance we provided on our q call due to an additional  million of negative fx headwinds during august and september on a constantcurrency basis revenue was up  and at the end of q recurring revenue represented  of total revenue up  constant currency operational gross margin was  in q this was up  basis points compared to last year primarily due to higher software revenue q npoi was  million up  on an asreported basis and up  on a constantcurrency basis nongaap eps was  up  as reported and up  constant currency free cash flow an area where our investors have been looking for continued progress has been a great success yeartodate and we are on track to achieve our updated fullyear guidance free cash flow excluding  million in recoveries related to the fox river in q  was up  million compared to last year we have generated  million in free cash flow yeartodate which is an increase of  million compared to the first nine months of last year i am now on slide number four where ill review our q and yeartodate softwarerelated revenues softwarerelated revenue was up  on a constantcurrency basis yearoveryear and continues to grow faster than our other revenue streams especially our cloud business our growth in cloud remains a high point in our overall results where constantcurrency revenue is up  in q and now up  yeartodate constant currency growing our software related revenue streams remains a top area of strategic focus as we look to improve our overall margins in a rapidly expanding available market for software and cloud solutions finally on slide number five ill spend a few moments running through some of the key highlights for q our results for the quarter were driven by our global leadership in our verticals along with solid execution across ncr this includes operating margin expansion in each of our businesses currency volatility along with china and russia continue to be our primary challenges but we are navigating through them our q earnings were in line with our outlook and weve remained on track to achieve our fullyear goals other key highlights include the performance of the each of our businesses which were generally balanced with the exception of financial services who was taking the brunt of fx and the chinarussia impact that being said we dont want to mask the solid performance of this division when you exclude china and russia where financial services delivered  yearoveryear constantcurrency growth our financial services business continues to generate strong demand in important strategic areas such as software cloud branch transformation and security application offers in retail we are encouraged by the moderate improvement in the industry dynamics in particular retail spending and how those dollars are being allocated growth in q was promising with revenues up  on a constantcurrency basis i am generally pleased with retails performance todate this year and well continue to innovate and provide solutions to our retail customers and enable them to run their businesses more efficiently to enhance flexibility and omnichannel solutions in hospitality higher software and cloud revenues once again drove yearoveryear operating margin expansion and  constantcurrency revenue growth this business has made significant progress over the past several quarters and we are pleased with the trajectory going forward another important highlight is our total software revenue which was up  on a constantcurrency basis during the quarter with continued strong growth in cloud and important wins across our verticals weve made additional progress executing our transformation to a hardwareenabled softwaredriven company we also continue to build a better ncr through sales and services transformation and our companywide restructuring efforts while benefiting these initiatives finally strong yeartodate free cash flow places us well ahead of last year in summary we had another important and solid quarter and are on track to achieve our fullyear targets i am pleased with the execution of the ncr team we are driving growth across all of our businesses and are focused on finishing the year strong finally with regard to recent industry consolidation we believe the merging of legacy hardware businesses is a good thing for our industry and an important validation of the business strategy we embarked upon five years ago ncr is a highly diversified global business providing a suite of omnichannel solutions and services to customers in a variety of industries including financial services retail and hospitality as a true omnichannel solutions provider in financial services ncr unlike its atm competitors bridges all banking channels and is actively helping top financial institutions around the globe transform their businesses into assetlight technologyheavy enterprises that engage with their customers both physically and digitally in short we feel extremely wellpositioned and well continue to stay laserfocused on our customers and strategic execution now i will like to turn the call over to bob to review our performance by segment and our financials bob robert p fishman  svp chief financial  accounting officer thank you bill ill start on slide six which shows our q operational results on an asreported and constantcurrency basis which bill previously discussed we experienced unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations during q with impacts of approximately  million in revenue  million in npoi and  in eps fx impact on revenue came in higher than originally expected with an additional  million of headwinds from our guidance at the beginning of the quarter revenue was higher by  npoi was higher by  and nongaap eps was higher by  all on a constantcurrency basis the next slide shows our q gaap results the increase in gaap results is primarily related to the impact of the restructuring program recorded in q  as compared to q  the restructuring plan charge included in income from operations was  million in q  and  million in q  on slide eight you will see our financial services q results on a constantcurrency basis revenue was flat due to improvements in the americas south pacific and middle east africa offset by declines in china and russia excluding china and russia revenue was up  on a constantcurrency basis operating margin was up  basis points at  the improvement was due to a favorable mix of revenue and expense management we remain focused on profitability through our transformation initiatives mix shifts and operating margin expansion we continued to see an increase in our branch transformation revenue which grew  yearoveryear led by north america constantcurrency backlog position grew double digits driven by branch transformation and cxbanking but along with this inherently slower conversion rates are affecting shortterm revenue and finally industry consolidation as bill mentioned is signaling positive indicators for future demand the next slide shows our retail solutions q results revenue was up  as reported and up  on a constantcurrency basis due to improvements in all regions operating margin was  and increased  basis points retail operating income increased from the prior year due to higher revenue including more softwarerelated revenue and expense management the retail market continues to show signs of improvement with some regions experiencing slower growth and additional fx headwinds we are having success gaining new competitive key accounts globally and we received the supplier of the year award for outstanding service from the australian supermarket coles lastly we are pleased with the positive reaction our retail one omnicommerce platform is continuing to receive from the market and our customers turning to the next slide hospitality revenue was up  on a constantcurrency basis driven by improvements in the highermargin revenue streams operating margin performance was  up  basis points due to this higher software related revenue including cloud and professional services revenue we continued to see success in the smb market with  revenue growth and  softwarerelated revenue growth we are pleased to report that we have deployed  application sites in the managed saas application family which includes  pulse realtime application sites softwarerelated revenues continue to drive growth for our hospitality business which are up  on a constantcurrency basis in q  which includes cloud revenue up  on a constantcurrency basis next looking at our emerging industry business on slide number  revenue was up  yearoveryear and up  on a constantcurrency basis driven by an increase in telecom and technology constantcurrency revenue operating margin was  up  basis points driven by higher services margins on slide  you can see the solid growth in cloud revenue on an asreported basis on a constantcurrency basis cloud was up  and softwarerelated revenue grew  hardware was down  as reported up  on a constantcurrency basis and other services which includes our traditional breakfix business was down by  as reported up  on a constantcurrency basis on slide  you can see free cash flow for the quarter free cash flow for q  was  million compared to  million in the prior quarter excluding  million in recoveries related to the fox river in q  the increase was mainly due to higher operating cash inflows on a yeartodate basis free cash flow was  million compared to a free cash flow of  million in the prior year we are maintaining our full year  free cash flow guidance range of  million to  million slide  is an update on the restructuring plan we incurred a pretax charge of  million in the first nine months of  and expect to incur an additional pretax charge of  million to  million in q  the cash impact was  million in the first nine months of  and we expect to pay an additional  million to  million in q  as far as savings generated we achieved  million in  and estimate approximately  million in  and approximately  million  as previously communicated we expect approximately  of the savings to benefit npoi with the remainder reinvested in the business we continue to evaluate additional opportunities in connection with this restructuring plan and well consider implementing initiatives that would generate incremental savings for the company slide  shows our net debt to ebitda metric where we closed q with a leverage ratio of  times this was benefited from our free cash flow generation in the quarter which has allowed us to achieve our yearend goal of under three times leverage one quarter earlier than expected slide  shows our full year  guidance fx headwinds continue full year revenue headwinds of approximately  million are now expected higher by  million from guidance in july and  million from beginning of the year guidance npois fx headwinds are still expected to be  million to  million up  million from the beginning of the year guidance and eps fx headwinds are  higher than the beginning of the year guidance we are decreasing our constantcurrency revenue guidance to  to  due to continued challenges in certain developing markets and slower backlog rollouts pushing into  we are narrowing our npoi range to  million to  million at the lower end of our previous range primarily due to the lower revenue and the additional  million of negative foreign currency impact from our beginning of the year guidance additionally we are narrowing our nongaap eps range to  to  which is at the high end of our previous range due to other expense effective tax rate and share count being lower than previously expected this guidance now includes an expected oie of  million a tax rate of  to  and a share count of  million slide  shows our updated  full year revenue guidance by segment we now expect financial services to grow  to  on a constantcurrency basis down from prior guidance due to continued challenges in china and russia and slower backlog rollouts we now expect retail solutions to grow  to  hospitality to grow  to  and emerging industries to grow  to  all on a constantcurrency basis on slide  you will find our q  guidance i expect asreported revenue will be in the range of  billion to  billion which includes a negative fx impact of roughly  compared to the prior year revenue is expected to be flat to up  on a constantcurrency basis i expect npoi to be negatively impacted by roughly  million of fx based on the midpoint of the range npoi growth is expected to be up  on an asreported basis and up  on a constantcurrency basis now ill open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you very much well take our first question from paul coster from jpmorgan paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc well first of all its nice to see another decent quarter but of course the question which everyone will be asking is what about the strategic review what can you say about that please bill william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you paul first of all i appreciate the kind opening on the strategic review paul that is ongoing we continue to comprehensively look at all of the alternatives we have as a board we are balancing both running the business responsibly and to your point making our commitments while also again with a lot of rigor looking at every single alternative we have and really giving it enough time for analysis and review so it is ongoing i anticipate it will be ongoing now for the next few months and well see where it lands but right now theres been no change in that particular analysis paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc bill does it have to come to a point of completion or are there items that may fall out of the strategic review that can be executed upon along the way and im particularly interested in bobs comments about restructuring and how there may be some additional restructuring opportunities ahead which didnt sound like they were part of the strategic review but i suspect theres some relationship there william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer yes paul you will likely see some aspects of the strategic review fall out into our nearterm actions and we cant get into that on the phone today but certainly if there is a smart thing for us to do were going to do it is there an official ending to the process i think the answer is yes but again i would tell you my learnings out of this is the following one when you take on that kind of a project its a hour workday and a lot of weekends so that you can responsibly run the business and secondarily the depth to which one needs to go for each alternative to give your board a thorough view is a lot of analysis it will not stop our board however from taking immediate action on areas that make sense and one of them paul may be some amount of additional restructuring one of the benefits for bob and i of going through the process has been weve had access to a number of exceptional resources that have looked inside of our company at a level of depth that would normally cost us millions of dollars of consulting fees that i think fortunately for us we didnt have to bear and were going to take their advice in some circumstances but make sure it makes sense for the business and we may decide to extend the restructuring initiative in q and q but were not quite there yet robert p fishman  svp chief financial  accounting officer ian i would say to that point is we are definitely focused on fastpayback opportunities that are attractive to investors as we continue to focus on higher margin higher growth opportunities endoflifing products as an example those continue to be areas – how do we become more efficient thats all work that continues to be done and we wanted to leave open the opportunity that if we did see some attractive fast payback opportunities that would be available to us paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks ill hop back on the queue operator well go next to ian zaffino from oppenheimer ian a zaffino  oppenheimer  co inc broker hi great thank you very much question will be on the pushout of the backlogs is that just an emerging markets phenomenon or are you seeing that in the developed markets and maybe what areas of the business are you seeing that in thanks william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks ian it really is primarily in the financial services area so ill ask andy heyman to comment andy andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services yeah hi ian in terms of where the backlog right now is a little slower than normal and just to give you some statistics on this we had earlier in the year anticipated some reduction in the typical backlog conversions based on our contracts were increasingly in the areas of higher branch transformation commitments higher enterprise software commitments and higher areas in terms of our refreshed atm fleet called the  series and we had planned in the back half of the year for about a basispoint reduction – im sorry a basispoint reduction in a typical backlog conversion so think of that as entering a quarter if youve got  million of backlog where there is  conversion we had planned it for about  basis points less what were seeing is about a basispoint less conversion because of those three areas there is a higher percentage of more innovative products in the queue right now the customers continue to try to get ready for if you will as they come out of rd into the implementation cycles and those go through typical certifications that can have delays there could be some rd areas where were tightening up et cetera so thats whats led to slower conversions and as we look into next year we think well start to revert to the mean but that is whats causing the backlog delays that youre seeing right now ian a zaffino  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay thank you and then next question maybe be more robert p fishman  svp chief financial  accounting officer i would add just to that point sorry ian i would add to that point andy that the backlog growth – constant currency is up double digits going into q and i expect it will continue to be strong going into  so while its rolling out more slowly because of the focus on these more innovative solutions the backlog growth is there william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah its a great point bob thanks ian a zaffino  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay and then i guess the followup question will be – maybe this is a semantic question but when you talk about strategic alternatives and maybe where were heading towards it seems maybe like a restructuring is most likely so given the advanced stages of this process is it still appropriate to call it strategic alternatives because like i said it would stimulate something probably larger than just a restructuring and again maybe were talking semantics but i guess my definition or i think most peoples definition of strategic alternatives would be greater than just a restructuring of whats just a cost cuts or a realignment of some product offerings maybe if you could help us understand that a little bit better or what your definition might be william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i apologize and – if it came off where we were giving you the impression that the ongoing review would only result in additional restructuring if that were the case we would shut it down and move in that direction that is not the case all of the – the areas that i have previously gone over with you are still under review and possible outcomes well beyond just restructuring ian a zaffino  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay all right thats great thank you for the clarification i appreciate this and william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah no worries ian a zaffino  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay thank you very much william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks operator well go next to meghna ladha from susquehanna international group hamza fodderwala  susquehanna financial group lllp hi this is hamza fodderwala in for meghna ladha i wanted to get a sense of – you had cited headwinds from russia and china of roughly i think  bps earlier this year in your guidance what exactly accelerated the weakness here william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer andy can you take that please andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services yeah the – in terms of russia and china they each have unique situations in terms – if youre referring to whats causing those headwinds in china what weve seen is a significant tightening under the governments secureandcontrol mandate to reduce spending the banks are allowed to invest in with companies that build systems outside of china that have rd that are not indigenous to chinese companies so that has caused banks to significantly reduce spending with companies that are not chinese companies and instead point it towards local companies so thats really accelerated the headwind in china in russia a very different story first of all the macroeconomic conditions in russia have been very challenged for local financial institutions there and then second of all we have a lot of contracts in us dollar in russia and when you have a contract in us dollar as the dollar has strengthened significantly over the last  months its made it much more difficult for a financial institution in russia to be able to afford our solution so its a bit of a double whammy thats going on in russia right now hamza fodderwala  susquehanna financial group lllp okay and then just to follow up i know you mentioned obviously a potential merger between a couple of your competitors just wanted to get your sense on the landscape should this transaction go through and do you think it could help stabilize the pricing environment in europe william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer ill make a couple of comments and then ask andy to give his point of view first of all i think on the surface the strategic rationale of two legacy atm providers coming together actually makes very good sense especially given that there really isnt a lot of geographic overlap for their market presence so on the surface i think it makes sense now both of their ceos have talked about the importance they place on investing in software in cloud in digital banking and using the combination perhaps to build a balance sheet to be able to invest in where customers in the market that they serve and we serve are going now of course weve been through that process for the last five years so we have a unique point of view on that i think the challenge for them if there are challenges are obvious to all of us in that a merger of that size is extremely difficult to pull off and i dont envy the geographic proximity issues the cultural differences between the two companies the product overlap issues that theyll inevitably have to face in choosing which product lives and which product does not the services infrastructure issues that theyll have to face clearly the issue around where they decide to make cost cuts in terms of employees and rd and theres a lot of fundamental issues that could if they do not execute well slow them down in a market thats moving very very fast so again on the surface i think its a good thing relative to the challenges for us of course we are now with many of our acquisitions and the assets we have behind us where they want to go laserfocused on innovation moving forward in a rapid fashion and i think putting ourselves into a great position in the market andy any other comments andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services yeah let me say a couple of things in – at an enterprise level obviously one of the companies has a retail business so i want michael bayer to also get a chance to say a couple of words but its largely about financial services with this merger possibility first of all we were not surprised by this news at all it had been something that we felt might make sense for a number of years for all the reasons bill outlined what our customers are telling us right now – and by the way theres been no shortage of communication between customers and us based on the recent news – but what theyre saying to us right now is a couple of things first of all is theyve congratulated us just looking at our value proposition how weve been so focused on a transformation for a number of years becoming much more softwaredriven so much of our revenue streams today in financial services do not come from atms anymore we have a very large and growing enterprise software business that in the recent quarter made up about  of our software revenues so weve been doing a lot of things to change the value proposition and for us its changed our operating margins quite substantially based on that innovation the second thing that theyre telling us is keep doing exactly what youre doing which makes a lot of sense to us we feel like the strategy that weve put in place has really changed the game in the industry its not just about physical channels its not just about digital channels were the ones that they look to to integrate channels seamlessly to help financial institutions control costs and improve revenues so its really been working for us in terms of your question about pricing you can never predict whats going to happen out there on pricing but theres a lot of competition there always has been in the financial services space theres a lot of spending and a lot of competition we dont expect that to change over the course of time but i would say just as were looking at recent activity that we do think that pricing is probably more stable right now than it was six months ago thats not to say that thats a new trend either its a highly competitive market hamza fodderwala  susquehanna financial group lllp okay thank you very much thats it for me operator well go next to kartik mehta with northcoast research kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc good afternoon bill bill i dont know if this is a question for you or maybe andy i was just wondering if either one of you could comment on digital insight and the growth youre witnessing now as its part of ncr and maybe some of the leverage you were able to get because of the atm business william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah sure first of all ill let andy do most of the talking kartik but we are very pleased so far with the progress were making in di andy any other further comments from you andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services well yeah a couple of things first of all its been the backbone for us of our whole community financial institution segment play that weve been making for a couple of years now that business will perform extremely well this year for us the digital insight component which is a subset of how we go to market in the community financial institution space continues to be growing this year in kind of the midsingle digits the key thing to know that weve been talking about is that we believe this is a business that can grow highsingle digits lowdouble digits longterm like our hospitality saas business and what weve been working on so hard is getting the customer satisfaction model extremely high and our team has done an exceptional job of that weve grown the net promoter score from negative numbers to very positive numbers in about  months were still – if you look at the business theres a lot of growth in end users which is great we have a new module coming to market right now we went live with it last week business banking we see a lot of growth ahead for the business and we just have to work through the erosion of some of the complaints in contracts from prior owners that should be behind us by the first half of next year so thats been the only headwind in the business that will be behind us soon enough so its been a fantastic acquisition thus far kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc so andy would that imply – if di is growing midsingle digits and if i look at financials of service numbers on a constantcurrency basis would that imply that overall atm business was down and if so what would you attribute that to andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services well yeah the atm business is – when we look at it right now it goes a little bit back to the backlog story there i would say the atm business generally speaking if you think about our business as the atm business versus the branch business versus di the atm business is – right now there is a softness to the point you mentioned but youve got to look at the russia china syndrome thats going on because that is causing a – depending on the quarter – a  basis point or  basis point impact so when you normalize it for that its a growth business still and the backlog position because of the points i made about slower backlog conversion is the cause of why its not even a faster growing business than that but its still a low singledigit growth business without russia china once the backlog starts to revert to the mean in the outer quarters here as we look into  then were back to what i would call a normal level of growth for the business kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc so youre just having two geographies negatively impact you andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services two geographies negatively impacting us along with slower conversion of other markets due to the percentage of contracts that are in these more innovative areas kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc and bill just one last question – obviously a lot of questions on the strategic review as you look at it today has it taken longer than you thought and if so as you look back why do you think so william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer oh for sure kartik its taken a lot longer than we initially thought and the reason is twofold i mentioned these earlier one is when youre a public company and you need to focus on running the business and running it responsibly there is only so many hours in the day and if you devote all of your time to a strategic review you could take your eye off the ball and we will not let that happen thats number one number two the depth of the analysis by alternative has been very comprehensive more comprehensive than i initially thought meaning were going deeper wider were viewing every alternative at a very comprehensive level and i think in the end that is the most responsible thing to do so i would say yes and for those reasons kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc thank you very much i appreciate it operator well go next to gil luria from wedbush securities gil b luria  wedbush securities inc yes thanks for taking my question excluding russia and china what other countries do you feel have gotten worse over the last few months and what currencies have been the incremental weight since you reported last time william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer hey gil its bill first of all i saw you in my office today on cnbc you looked very handsome how about it andy gil b luria  wedbush securities inc thank you i appreciate that william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer and on this question ill ask andy to answer that andy andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services yeah i think let me say a couple of things first of all the african nations in general have – weve started to see some softness there and i dont know if you caught my comments related to russia and the fact that theres a lot of contracts we have in russia on us dollar its the same thing with africa where you might see anywhere from a  to  fx impact there that – if a distributor is buying a product from us in us dollars all of a sudden that same product costs  to  more makes it more difficult for them to do business so african nations weve seen softness there this year relative to prior year and thats been the big one and id say as we look out while its not been a material impact yet we do believe there could be a little bit of softness ahead with a couple of the other brics as well down the road but right now i would say its limited to more in africa maybe to a smaller extent other parts of asia robert p fishman  svp chief financial  accounting officer and then gil this is bob on the kind of currency question we saw for the full year  million more revenue headwind about twothirds came from three currencies in brazil canada and australia brazil changed by roughly  from when we gave guidance in july and then there were probably  currencies that all weakened versus the us dollar so those were the three big ones but then it was across the board on the remaining piece william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer the interesting thing gil is when you take out russia and china and you look at andys business he actually grew orders in q exchina and russia by  fxneutral and grew revenue by  fxneutral so it gives you a sense of the impact of china and russia this year so far gil b luria  wedbush securities inc so let me – first i wanted to ask bob another question just again for modeling below the line you changed three of the assumptions for the annual guidance the share count the interest expense and the tax rate can you go through what are the changes that have happened in those lines to reduce them robert p fishman  svp chief financial  accounting officer yeah so previously for other income and expense we had guided to  million to  million we now think that number will be closer to  million interest expense is down we also started the year from an oie perspective building in a little bit more fx volatility on that particular line and then we saw some favorability in just a couple of other areas around bank fees as an example so thats why we were able to bring the other income and expense down to that  million number on taxes we continued to do a good job we had guided originally to  we now think well be closer to  to  in terms of the tax rate and then on the share count you make assumptions at the beginning of the year we said  million its looking like its closer to  million and again that includes a number of assumptions around forfeitures et cetera so those three all help gil b luria  wedbush securities inc got it i just want to circle back into the brics and ask because you guys have so many feet on the street in all these different countries a little bit of the really high level perspective about what your prospect is for those markets for the emerging markets especially the big ones is this – are we looking at a multiyear slowdown after a few decades of growth or is this just some hesitation or contagion from the chinese stock market how do you guys view the macro backdrop for the emerging market businesses that you have given the specific insight that you have there william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think it is a little different by market in china to be successful longterm were going to have to go in a direction that helps us to become more of a local player in the market so if the regulatory environment does not change in china and it could were going to have to figure out what our longterm strategic plan is around going local and there are a variety of interesting alternatives there for us but our goal by the way there would be certainly to become more softwarefocused than hardware in russia it really is a macro and currency headwind that should over time abate now of course theyre very sensitive to the oil markets in terms of the impact on their economic growth and clearly relative to their relationship with the us that can also feature prominently in our success however my thinking there is that that market will see more stability over time for us than not brazil has certainly been more challenged given their macroeconomic situation i think for brazil well have to wait and see environment but they have experienced more of a slowdown there and india is a different market altogether i think allin for us is very marketdependent i do not expect by the way  to see as much of a drag on our revenue from russia and china simply because we begin to lap difficult compares by the middle of next year so andy you may want to give some more commentary on that point andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services yeah let me also just add one thing and we think its really important when you look at the brics right now for us theyre largely not the places that we have driven the transformation agenda and where that really shows up is on the gross margin and operating income line of each of the four regions this year in  we will see a hit from an operating income perspective for those headwinds but those should really abate next year and beyond to bills point even though the revenues may still have some challenges id say most of the margin dollars there of where the risks would be the risk there is much lower on the margin dollar perspective than where the future revenue softness may land with each of the four markets so thats the other thing i would add that i think is really important as we assess the impact on operating income in the outer years here gil b luria  wedbush securities inc got it thank you very much operator well go next to matt summerville from alembic global advisors matt summerville  alembic global advisors hey can you guys hear me okay william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah matt summerville  alembic global advisors perfect i want to talk just one more minute on the atm business if you look at going from kind of up  to  constant currency to up  to  constant currency and you bear in mind that roughly halfish of the business should be annuitylike services thats a really big reduction in the final quarter of the year if you will or the final half of the year relative to your q guidance and then the whole china and russia thing is not necessarily new in my view and then you talk about an industry thats sort of pushing stuff out because its  moving fast so im just trying to square all those  i know theres a lot of moving pieces but if you can help me make sense of all of that it would be extremely helpful andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services bill can i get that william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah please go ahead andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services okay yeah good good so matt good question just so you know matt you did garble up a little bit at the end of the question but i think i got the gist of it which is i think youre saying in the fourth quarter how did you have a basispoint to basispoint drop in revenue especially given that you got a reasonable annuity stream its really the backlog conversion id say when we looked at it we planned in q and q for backlog conversion rates that were  basis points less than last year in both of the quarters roughly and where were landing now is basispoint reduction over prior year so just to use some real math and ill just use rough numbers here in the third quarter we – in the fourth quarter where were now landing has cost  to  of backlog conversions a little lower in the third quarter a little higher in fourth quarter so that  to  compares to last years  to  we had planned on being a basispoint drop from last year not basispoint drop and  basis points called on roughly  million of backlog is in the  millionplus range per quarter thats the drop we frankly did not do a good job with the modeling there this outlook here is much more conservative and much more responsible and weve planned expenses accordingly matt summerville  alembic global advisors got it i appreciate the color and then just one followup getting back to the whole strategic side of things i guess at some point you have to be able to kind of put a check in the box and say this is a viable this isnt viable this is viable this isnt viable and so on and so forth and i feel like were right back where ncr was six to nine months ago when some of this stuff started getting discussed rumored what have you i guess – so what boxes have been checked or not checked or what opportunities actually appear viable from a strategic standpoint from here going forward william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah matt i think its just too early to give you a checkthebox view i think weve seen all of the options remain viable and the board of directors is looking at them in concert with one another and the optionality of one versus another in terms of whats best for our shareholders in ncr matt summerville  alembic global advisors is there a timeframe bill i mean you guys talked about having an analyst meeting in september that sort of got canceled – im not going to call it last minute but not all that far in advance of the actual meeting at least officially i mean when can we expect and i think theres a lot of folks sort of waiting for this – when can we expect to hear something more definitive about where this company goes from here – from an inflection standpoint strategically et cetera william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think once the strategic process has completed and we have something of note to say other than continuing to execute to our plan and execute to our guidance we will not have an investor meeting but i would tell you that right now it will either be in q or q is my estimation right now matt matt summerville  alembic global advisors great thanks a lot guys operator well take our next question from prasad borra with goldman sachs skprasad borra  goldman sachs international hi thanks for taking my questions couple if i may probably just focus on the free cash flow generation now youre talking about incremental restructuring measures given what you have gone through in terms of the process and probably you have a better view on which are the elements of the business which can be improved would you say that there are some additional tailwinds or benefits you can see from a free cash flow perspective which could offset some of the impacts on additional restructuring costs andrew s heyman  senior vice president vpncr financial services yes without a doubt i mean were very focused on the savings that those additional restructuring initiatives would drive so my view is that i would not expect a negative impact in  if anything well see incremental free cash flow associated with the restructuring skprasad borra  goldman sachs international okay and bill you had mentioned that theres a lot of new learnings which you had from probably reading the data a lot more and probably getting the consulting experience which you would have probably not have explored before what are the key takings from it operationally what can you do better and also in terms of probably setting the guidance are there any lessons to take would you be more willing to be conservative in terms of giving guidance and yeah anything you can say from that perspective william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think what weve learned is that we can be a bit more focused on resource allocation and a bit more aggressive on resource allocation where we see higher growth and higher margin expansion that would be point one point two that we have some amount of inefficiency and a level of underproductiveness in certain aspects of the company that we can go to work on and overall that our cost structure can be a bit more competitive going forward but while driving the kind of growth and bottomline expansion and cash flow that we think we can drive in terms of guidance were meeting our guidance this year i think weve done a good job in terms of setting guidance on that point i might add one of the things bob and i are proud of is the fact that since we gave npoi guidance in february weve seen about  million to  million more of npoi headwinds as a result of fx and we did not take guidance down to  million to  million in that range to reflect the additional headwinds of fx we stuck with our guidance and were proud of the fact that we can navigate through those headwinds and make our guidance skprasad borra  goldman sachs international okay thats pretty much from my end thank you operator and at this time i would like to turn the call back over to bill nuti for any additional or closing remarks william r nuti  chairman president  chief executive officer well thank you all for joining us and we appreciate the questions as always we look forward to being in contact you if something were to change within the quarter well certainly be in contact you but otherwise we look forward to talking to you again in q good night operator this does conclude todays conference we thank you for your participation
