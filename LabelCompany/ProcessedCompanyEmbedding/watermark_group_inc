company zika diagnostics inc formerly known as watermark group inc a nevada corporation headquartered in salt lake city utah prior to consummation of the license agreement was a development stage company that was a shell company as that term is defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  on october   the company entered into the license agreement with the parent which closed on october   on october   the parent entered into a stock purchase agreement to purchase a controlling interest in the company in anticipation of entering into the license agreement which closed on october   the company intends to respond to the  outbreak of the zika virus by providing state of the art diagnostics tools to the medical community primarily in developing nations where the outbreak is most severe  pursuant to the license agreement the company has licensed molecular diagnostics technology from the parent and plans to market a panel of diagnostics tests developed using the licensed technology the company plans to respond to the international crises surrounding the spread of the zika virus that has become acute in the last six months  pursuant to the license agreement we have licensed the exclusive rights to make use manufacture sell and license polymerase chain reaction pcr tests using the parents patented technology for detecting the zika virus as well as other mosquitoborne flaviviruses which include dengue yellow fever west nile virus and japanese encephalitis as well as the alphavirus chikungunya  pursuant to the license agreement we have also licensed the nonexclusive right to sell the parents malaria test  the tests to be distributed by the company include a multiplex test for all of these flaviviruses plus chikungunya differentiating among the viruses to rapidly diagnose the specific infection as all these viruses exhibit similar symptoms but require different treatments  the licensed technology the parent developed and patented a molecular diagnostics platform system that enables rapid lowcost sophisticated molecular testing for organisms and genetic diseases by greatly automating historically complex procedures in both the development and administration of tests one of the parents newest technical advances involves a novel approach to pcr primer design cooperative primers that eliminates one of the key vexing issues of pcr amplification the exponential growth of primerdimer pairs false positives or false negatives which adversely interfere with identification of the target dna in addition the parents scientists have enhanced the understanding of the mathematics of dna test design so as to engineer a dna test and automate algorithms to screen millions of possible designs to find the optimum dna test design  the parents proprietary platform of codx™   technologies integrates and streamlines these steps as it analyzes biological samples  the company entered into an exclusive license to make use sell and licensed pcr tests using codx™ technology but only for the zika virus and certain other flaviviruses and alphaviruses including dengue chikungunya yellow fever west nile virus and japanese encephalitis and on a nonexclusive basis malaria  together these tests are referred to as the licensed tests and the technology to design make use sell and license the tests is referred to as the licensed technology pcr market opportunity the molecular diagnostics market is the fastest growing portion of the  billion us in vitro test tube based controlled environment diagnostics market in vitro diagnostics is expected to grow to a  billion industry in  given the advantages of molecular tests over other forms of diagnostic testing which include higher sensitivities the ability to perform multiplex tests and the ability to test for drug resistance or individual genes this segment of the market remains the fastest growing the molecular diagnostics market specifically   is expected to aggregate  billion by  from  billion in  at a growth rate of  from  to  competitive business conditions the molecular diagnostics industry is extremely competitive  there are many firms that provide some or all of the products we provide and provide many diagnostic tests that we have yet to develop  many of these competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial resources  because we are not established many of our competitors have a competitive advantage in the diagnostic testing industry because they also have other lines of business in the diagnostics and pharmaceutical industries from which they derive revenues and for which they are well known and respected in the medical profession  we will need to overcome the disadvantage of being a start up with no history of success and not being well known in the testing industry  in the diagnostics testing industry we compete with such companies as biomerieux siemans qiagen and cepheid and with such pharmaceutical companies as abbott laboratories becton dickinson and johnson and johnson many of these competitors already have an established customer base with industry standard technology which we must penetrate to be successful market strategy the company anticipates generating revenue from coventures with incountry test manufacturing partners from sublicensing agreements and from sharedrevenue contracts with biotech companies speedtomarket test development companion diagnostics and diagnostics product distributors  our market strategy is focused on the following goals  provide affordable and accurate zika and other flavivirusalphavirus pcr tests worldwide             sell to multiple prospective markets in the us gulf states in the caribbean in latin america and elsewhere a through molecular diagnostics manufacturers and distributors labs private organizations and government agencies addressing healthcare needs in developed and developing nations b to clinical reference labs as an affordable test development alternative in creating their own dnabased tests internally or outsourcing development to the company c to pharmaceutical companies looking for accurate companion diagnostics as they introduce new vaccines or therapeutics to the market   seek strategic partnerships with mediumtolargecap biotech companies that can provide broader distribution and a potential merger or acquisition opportunity product offering · current  the company has an exclusive license to a panel of tests developed on the parents proprietary analytical systems currently addressing the licensed tests which are zika dengue chikungunya yellow fever west nile virus and japanese encephalitis and on a nonexclusive basis and not included in the testing panel malaria · near future  the company will continue to enhance its existing tests and as its distribution channels develop it will seek to license other tests to sell through its distributors likewise the parent has a vested interest in continuing to iterate and improve the designs of the licensed tests and will continue to do so all subsequent versions of which are licensed under the license agreement  competitive advantages of licensed tests · affordability  much lowercost test kits  a fraction of competitors pricing  reductions · flexibility  the licensed tests can run on many vendors dna diagnostic testing machines they are particularly well suited to the new generation of labonachip and pointofcare loc and poc highly portable analysis machinery for field clinic and office applications · speed  rapid assay development and time to results · sophistication  tests are built on pcr technology taking advantage of one of the most advanced diagnostic testing platforms · accuracy  tests are more accurate than competitors and can detect more strains of viruses · exclusivity  the parent licensor codiagnostics inc owns all patents and intellectual property and we have acquired some exclusive and nonexclusive rights as described above · broad footprint  with a dynamic technology that encompasses markets worldwide the company can identify the best target markets not only in highly burdened developing countries but also in developed nations · growth industry category  dna testing is the fastestgrowing segment of invitro diagnostic testing · combination product offering – the licensed tests are ultrasensitive and are the perfect match for a new generation of more affordable molecular diagnostic devices now entering the market used together these affordable tests  devices will revolutionize the molecular diagnostics industry in cost mobility speed of test results and simplification   market for goods and services severity of the problem on january   the center for disease control cdc activated its incident management system and working through the emergency operations center eoc centralized its response to the outbreaks of zika occurring in the americas and increased reports of birth defects and guillainbarré syndrome in areas affected by zika on february   the world health organization declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic because of clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders in some areas affected by zika on february   cdc elevated its response efforts to a level  activation the highest response level at the agency source httpwwwcdcgovzikageo the zika virus is now spreading explosively in the americas the head of the world health organization said thursday with another official estimating between  million to  million infections in the region over a month period the lack of any immunity to zika and the fact that mosquitoes spreading the virus can be found most everywhere in the americas  from argentina to the southern united states  explains the speed of its transmission said dr sylvain aldighieri an official with the who and pan american health organization aldighieri gave the estimate for zika infections including people who do not report clinical symptoms based on data regarding the spread of a different mosquitoborne virus  dengue he acknowledged the virus is circulating with very high intensity some  of those infected with the zika virus dont even feel sick and most who do have relatively mild symptoms such as a fever rash joint pain or pink eye but there are major worries about the dangers pregnant women and their babies face chan said that where the virus has arrived theres been a corresponding steep increase in the birth of babies with abnormally small heads and in cases of guillainbarre syndrome having small heads can cause severe developmental issues and sometimes death guillainbarre is a rare autoimmune disorder that can lead to lifethreatening paralysis health authorities began to suspect a connection between zika and neurological ailments especially in fetuses and newborns brazil alone has reported more than  cases of microcephaly  a neurological disorder resulting in the births of babies with small heads  in infants born to women infected with zika while pregnant source httpwwwcnncomhealthzikavirusglobalresponse the more researchers learn about the zika virus the scarier it appears federal health officials said monday as they urged more money for mosquito control and to develop vaccines and treatments scientists increasingly believe the zika virus sweeping through latin america and the caribbean causes devastating defects in fetal brains if women become infected during pregnancy everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought dr anne schuchat of the centers for disease control and prevention said at a white house briefing source httpcbsnewscomnewsofficialszikavirusscarierthanwethought  zika virus has been identified in  countries as of march  including the us southern states for the most recent recorded year there were over  million births in central and south america in cabo verde in africa and in affected regions of polynesia there were an additional  births in the us gulf states and hawaii based on current research it appears that the zika virus passes through the placenta of some mothers who have an active strain of the virus during the first trimester of their pregnancies it is estimated that the infection remains active rather than latent for up to  days a pregnant woman ideally should be tested every  days during the first trimester or  times to date over  cases of birth defects from zika have been identified in the brazilian states rio de janeiro and bahia thus the potential market for a highly accurate affordable pcr diagnostic test could be approximately  million x  tests or over  million tests note zika does not always manifest acute symptoms therefore a broad test initiative will have to be implemented the who recently announced that the incidence of sexual transmission of the zika virus is higher than earlier analyses indicated thus the market for a zika screening test may be double the numbers listed above zika is a flavivirus all of which are transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito they include zika virus dengue yellow fever west nile virus and japanese encephalitis chikungunya an alphavirus is likewise transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito many have similar symptoms the companys next product after a zika screening will be a pcr multiplex test to differentiate among these viruses in the patient there are over a million cases of dengue in brazil alone and its symptoms are very similar to those of zika compliance with government regulation we will be regulated by the us federal drug administration and our products must be approved by the fda before we will be allowed to sell our tests in the united states unless we sell to clinical research labs who are allowed to use our tests under their general umbrella of testing for diseases without applying for fda approval to service the general public  because our parents lab is iso  and iso  certified it is well prepared to obtain a selfcertified ceivd marking for its products which will allow us to sell our tests in most developed countries in europe and asia as well as in most developing nations which are our initial target markets  each country will have its individual registration and regulatory requirements which will need to be met as well research and development we will have no responsibility to perform additional research and development as our license agreement with our parent puts the responsibility to complete the development of all of the licensed tests on the parent  further the license agreement gives us the right to new innovations discovered and developed by our parent in the course of its development activities including further development of the tests using the parents unique technology    corporate office we maintain offices currently at  s highland drive salt lake city utah  which includes two offices comprising approximately  square feet leased on a month to month basis for  per month  we are seeking a different location which may include relocating with or moving   adjacent to our parents corporate offices in salt lake city    employees we currently have five employees two of which are parttime all are located at our corporate offices   legal proceedings we are not aware of any material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which our property is the subject we also know of no proceedings to which any of our directors officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial holders of more than  of any class of our securities or any associate of any such director officer affiliate or security holder are an adverse party or have a material interest adverse to us   item a risk factors   an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should   consider carefully the following risks along with all of the other information   included in this report before deciding to buy our common stock   additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we   currently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if we   are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from occurring then   our business may suffer   risks related to our company   we have a limited commercial history upon which to base our prospects have not generated revenues or profits and do not expect to generate profits for the foreseeable future   we may never achieve or sustain profitability       we have not earned any revenue to date and do not expect to earn significant revenue in the near future we had a net loss of    and  in the threemonth period ending july   the twelvemonth period ending april   and the twelvemonth period ending april   respectively our accumulated deficit was  and  as of july   and april   respectively potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by a new enterprise many of which are beyond our control including substantial risks and expenses in the course of developing new diagnostic tests establishing or entering new markets organizing operations and marketing procedures the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of these risks expenses complications and delays and the competitive environment in which we operate there is therefore nothing at this time upon which to base an assumption that our business plan will prove successful and we may not be able to generate significant revenue raise additional capital or operate profitably we will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early commercial stage companies including scaling up our infrastructure and headcount and may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties or delays in connection with our growth in addition as a result of the startup nature of our business we can be expected to continue to sustain substantial operating expenses without generating sufficient revenues to cover expenditures as discussed in note  to our audited financial statements our recurring operating losses and our need for additional sources of capital to fund our ongoing operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern any investment in our company is therefore highly speculative and could result in the loss of your entire investment we will need to raise additional capital which may not be available on favorable terms if at all and which may cause dilution to stockholders restrict our operations or adversely affect our ability to operate our business      as of april   our cash balance was  and our working capital deficit was  at our current rate of expenditures we estimate that our existing capital resources will fund our operations for twelve months accordingly we will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or through other means in order to sustain our operations and current business strategy we may be unable to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms or at all and any additional financings could result in additional dilution to our thenexisting stockholders or restrict our operations or adversely affect our ability to operate our business if we are unable to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms we may not be able to implement our business plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to meet our business objectives our equity value may decrease and investors may lose some or all of their investment if we raise funds by issuing equity securities the percentage ownership of     our then stockholders will be reduced if we raise funds by issuing debt the ability of our stockholders to receive earnings or distributions may be adversely affected and we may be subject to additional covenants and restrictions the best efforts structure of this offering may yield insufficient gross proceeds to execute on our business plan    the underwriters are offering the shares on a bestefforts basis the underwriters are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but will use their best efforts to sell the shares offered as a bestefforts offering  there can be no assurance that the offering contemplated hereby will ultimately be consummated or will result in any proceeds being made to us the success of this offering will impact our ability to cover expenses and finance operations over the next  months if no shares are sold in this offering or if we sell only a minimum number of shares yielding insufficient gross proceeds we may be unable to cover our expenses successfully fund operations or execute on our business plan this would result in a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations our nearterm success is dependent upon our ability to commence sales of our tests     our success will depend in part upon our ability to commence sales of our tests attracting new customers requires substantial time and expense any failure to initiate sales of our tests to validate our platform would adversely affect our operating results many factors could affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our diagnostic tests including     •   our ability to convince our potential customers of the advantages and economic value of our tests over competing technologies and diagnostic tests     •   the breadth of our test menu relative to competitors     •   changes to policies procedures or currently accepted best practices in clinical diagnostic testing     •   the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts     •   our ability to manufacture our commercial diagnostic tests and meet demand in a timely fashion if we cannot successfully develop obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize new diagnostic tests our financial results will be harmed and our ability to compete will be harmed     our financial performance depends in part upon our ability to successfully develop and market new tests in a rapidly changing technological and economic environment if we fail to successfully introduce new diagnostic tests we could lose customers and market share we could also lose market share if our competitors introduce new diagnostic tests or technologies that render our diagnostic tests less competitive or obsolete in addition delays in the introduction of new diagnostic tests due to regulatory developmental or other obstacles could negatively impact our revenue and market share as well as our earnings factors that can influence our ability to introduce new diagnostic tests the timing associated with new product approvals and commercial success of these diagnostic tests include      •   the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities     •   our ability to successfully initiate and complete clinical trial studies     •   timely expansion of our menu of tests     •   the results of clinical trials needed to support any regulatory approvals of our tests     •   our ability to obtain requisite fda or other regulatory clearances or approvals for our tests under development on a timely basis     •   demand for the new diagnostic tests we introduce     •   product offerings from our competitors and     •   the functionality of new diagnostic tests that address market requirements and customer demands   we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations      our diagnostic tests are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the fda and comparable foreign agencies to varying degrees each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our diagnostic tests in the clinical market our diagnostic tests are regulated by the fda and comparable agencies of other countries in particular fda regulations govern activities such as product development product testing product labeling product storage premarket clearance or approval manufacturing advertising promotion product sales reporting of certain product failures and distribution our diagnostic tests will require k clearance from the fda prior to marketing in the united states clinical trials are required to support a k submission since  the fda has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations including medical device companies by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities the fda has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations the fda could refuse to grant premarket approval applications or require certificates of foreign governments for exports andor require us to notify health professionals and others any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our diagnostic tests foreign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future penalties for a companys noncompliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe including revocation or suspension of a companys business license and criminal sanctions any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us our current and potential customers in the united states and elsewhere may also be subject directly or indirectly to applicable antikickback fraud and abuse false claims transparency health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations which could expose us to criminal sanctions civil penalties contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings the life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change if our competitors and potential competitors develop superior diagnostic tests and technologies our competitive position and results of operations would suffer      we face intense competition from a number of companies that offer diagnostic tests in our target markets many of which have substantially greater financial resources and larger more established marketing sales and service organizations than we do the life sciences industry is characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation we may need to develop new technologies for our diagnostic tests to remain competitive one or more of our current or future competitors could render our present or future diagnostic tests obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances we may also encounter other problems in the process of delivering new diagnostic tests to the marketplace such as problems related to design development or manufacturing of such diagnostic tests and as a result we may be unsuccessful in selling such diagnostic tests our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively against current technologies as well as to respond effectively to technological advances by developing and marketing diagnostic tests that are competitive in the continually changing technological landscape if our diagnostic tests do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our diagnostic tests are based is questioned we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance of our diagnostic tests increased costs and damage to our reputation       our success depends on the markets confidence that we can provide reliable highquality diagnostic tests we believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors our reputation and the public image of our diagnostic tests or technologies may be impaired if our diagnostic tests fail to perform as expected or our diagnostic tests are perceived as difficult to use despite quality control testing defects or errors could occur in our diagnostic tests or technologies in the future if our diagnostic tests experience a material defect or error this could result in loss or delay of revenues delayed market acceptance damaged reputation diversion of development resources legal claims increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs any of which could harm our business such defects or errors could also prompt us to amend certain warning labels or narrow the scope of the use of our diagnostic tests either of which could hinder our success in the market even after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved any widespread concerns regarding our technology or any manufacturing defects or performance errors in our diagnostic tests could result in lost revenue delayed market acceptance damaged reputation increased service and warranty costs and claims against us if our international distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our diagnostic tests will be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected     outside of the united states we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our diagnostic tests in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including     •   agreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the partners     •   our distributors may not devote sufficient resources to the sale of diagnostic tests     •   our distributors may be unsuccessful in marketing our diagnostic tests and     •   we may not be able to negotiate future distributor agreements on acceptable terms if we become subject to claims relating to improper handling storage or disposal of hazardous materials we could incur significant cost and time to comply      our research and development processes involve the controlled storage use and disposal of hazardous materials including biological hazardous materials we are subject to foreign federal state and local regulations governing the use manufacture storage handling and disposal of materials and waste products we may incur significant costs complying with both existing and future environmental laws and regulations in particular we are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration or osha and the environmental protection agency or epa and to regulation under the toxic substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act in the united states osha or the epa may adopt additional regulations in the future that may affect our research and development programs the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be eliminated completely in the event of an accident we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our workers compensation insurance we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms if at all our diagnostic tests have not been manufactured on a high volume scale and are subject to unforeseen scaleup risks      while we have developed a process to manufacture diagnostic tests there can be no assurance that we can manufacture our diagnostic tests at a scale that is adequate for our future commercial needs we may face significant or unforeseen difficulties in manufacturing our diagnostic tests including but not limited to     •   technical issues relating to manufacturing components of our diagnostic test cartridges on a high volume commercial scale at reasonable cost and in a reasonable time frame     •   difficulty meeting demand or timing requirements for orders due to excessive costs or lack of capacity for part or all of an operation or process             •   changes in government regulations or in quality or other requirements that lead to additional manufacturing costs or an inability to supply product in a timely manner if at all and     •   increases in raw material or component supply cost or an inability to obtain supplies of certain critical supplies needed to complete our manufacturing processes these and other difficulties may only become apparent when scaling up to the manufacturing process of our diagnostic tests to a more substantive commercial scale in the event our diagnostic tests cannot be manufactured in sufficient commercial quantities or manufacturing is delayed our future prospects could be significantly impacted and our financial prospects would be materially harmed  we or our suppliers may experience development or manufacturing problems or delays that could limit the growth of our revenue or increase our losses      we may encounter unforeseen situations in the manufacturing of our diagnostic tests that could result in delays or shortfalls in our production our suppliers may also face similar delays or shortfalls in addition our or our suppliers production processes may have to change to accommodate any significant future expansion of our manufacturing capacity which may increase our or our suppliers manufacturing costs delay production of our diagnostic tests reduce our product gross margin and adversely impact our business if we are unable to keep up with demand for our diagnostic tests by successfully manufacturing and shipping our diagnostic tests in a timely manner our revenue could be impaired market acceptance for our diagnostic tests could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors diagnostic tests in addition developing manufacturing procedures for new diagnostic tests may require developing specific production processes for those diagnostic tests developing such processes could be time consuming and any unexpected difficulty in doing so can delay the introduction of a product we expect to rely on third parties to conduct studies of our diagnostic tests that will be required by the fda or other regulatory authorities and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily  we do not have the ability to independently conduct the field trial studies or other studies that may be required to obtain fda and other regulatory clearances or approvals for our diagnostic tests accordingly we expect to rely on third parties such as independent testing laboratories and hospitals to conduct such studies our reliance on these third parties will reduce our control over these activities these thirdparty contractors may not complete activities on schedule or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time skill and resources to our studies our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of any applicable requirement to prepare and ensure compliance with various procedures required under good clinical practices if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons our studies may be extended delayed suspended or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for additional diagnostic tests product liability claims could adversely impact our financial condition and our earnings and impair our reputation  inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information with respect to our diagnostic tests could result in an unsafe condition injury to or death of a patient the occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims or safety alert relating to one or more of our diagnostic tests product liability claims regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers for our diagnostic tests health care policy changes including us health care reform legislation signed in  may have a material adverse effect on us    in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of  were signed into law elements of this legislation such as comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations    many health care industry companies including health care systems are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for diagnostic tests if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our projected revenues would decrease and our earnings financial condition andor cash flows would suffer our ability to compete depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees     our future success depends on our ability to identify attract train integrate and retain highly qualified technical development sales and marketing managerial and administrative personnel competition for highly skilled individuals is extremely intense and we face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel in many areas of our business we may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure many of the companies with which we compete for hiring experienced employees have greater resources than we have if we fail to identify attract train integrate and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel our reputation could suffer and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected our future success also depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management team the replacement of members of our senior management team likely would involve significant time and costs and the loss of any these individuals may delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations       we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions changes in existing tax laws treaties regulations or policies or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or the enactment or adoption of new tax laws treaties regulations or policies could materially impact our effective tax rate if we do not achieve sustain or successfully manage our anticipated growth our business and prospects will be harmed      if we are unable to obtain or sustain adequate revenue growth our financial results could suffer furthermore significant growth will place strains on our management and our operational and financial systems and processes and our operating costs may escalate even faster than planned if we cannot effectively manage our expanding operations and our costs we may not be able to grow effectively or we may grow at a slower pace additionally if we do not successfully forecast the timing of regulatory authorization for our additional tests marketing and subsequent demand for our diagnostic tests or manage our anticipated expenses accordingly our operating results will be harmed other companies or institutions have commercial diagnostic tests or may develop and market novel or improved methods for infectious disease diagnostic testing which may make our diagnostic platform less competitive or obsolete  the market for diagnostic testing is large and established and our competitors may possess significantly greater financial resources and have larger development and commercialization capabilities than we do we may be unable to compete effectively against these competitors either because their diagnostic platforms are superior or because they may have more expertise experience financial resources or stronger business relationships new technologies techniques or diagnostic tests could emerge that might offer better combinations of price and performance than our current or future diagnostic tests  it is critical to our success that we anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and to successfully introduce on a timely and costeffective basis new enhanced and competitive technologies that meet the needs of current and prospective customers if we do not successfully innovate and introduce new technology into our product lines or manage the transitions to new product offerings our revenues results of operations and business will be adversely impacted competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities technologies standards or customer requirements we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved diagnostic tests and as new companies enter the market with new technologies we are dependent on single source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in our diagnostic tests and supply chain interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance  our diagnostic tests are manufactured by us and we obtain supplies from a limited number of suppliers in some cases critical components required to manufacture our diagnostic tests may only be available from a sole supplier or limited number of suppliers any of whom would be difficult to replace the supply of any of our manufacturing materials may be interrupted because of poor vendor performance or other events outside our control which may require us among other things to identify alternate vendors and result in lost sales and increased expenses even if the manufacturing materials that we source are available from other parties the time and effort involved in validating the new supplies and obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals for substitutes could impede our operations   risks related to our securities   the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially      the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate in addition to the other risks mentioned in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus are     •   sales of our common stock by our stockholders executives and directors     •   volatility and limitations in trading volumes of our shares of common stock     •   fluctuations in our results of operations     •   our ability to enter new markets     •   actual or unanticipated fluctuations in our annual and quarterly financial results     •   our ability to obtain financings to continue and expand our commercial activities expand our manufacturing operations conduct and complete research and development activities including but not limited to our human clinical trials and other business activities        •   our ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to continue and expand our commercial activities develop additional diagnostic tests conduct clinical trials and gain approval for our additional diagnostic tests on our desired schedule     •   commencement enrollment or results of our clinical trials of our diagnostic tests or any future clinical trials we may conduct     •   changes in the development status of our diagnostic tests     •   any delays or adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to the fdas review of our planned clinical trials     •   any delay in our submission for studies or test approvals or adverse regulatory decisions including failure to receive regulatory approval for our diagnostic tests     •   our announcements or our competitors announcements regarding new tests enhancements significant contracts acquisitions or strategic investments     •   unanticipated safety concerns related to our diagnostic tests     •   failures to meet external expectations or management guidance     •   changes in our capital structure or dividend policy including as a result of future issuances of securities and sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders     •   our cash position     •   announcements and events surrounding financing efforts including debt and equity securities     •   our inability to enter into new markets or develop new diagnostic tests     •   reputational issues     •   competition from existing technologies and diagnostic tests or new technologies and diagnostic tests that may emerge     •   announcements of acquisitions partnerships collaborations joint ventures new diagnostic tests capital commitments or other events by us or our competitors     •   changes in general economic political and market conditions in any of the regions in which we conduct our business     •   changes in industry conditions or perceptions     •   changes in valuations of similar companies or groups of companies     •   analyst research reports recommendations and changes in recommendations price targets and withdrawals of coverage     •   departures and additions of key personnel     •   disputes and litigations related to intellectual properties proprietary rights and contractual obligations     •   changes in applicable laws rules regulations or accounting practices and other dynamics     •   release or expiry of lockup or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding common shares     •   announcements or actions taken by our principal stockholders and     •   other events or factors many of which may be out of our control in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management  future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our share price to fall      we expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations including expanding research and development funding clinical trials purchasing of capital equipment hiring new personnel commercializing our diagnostic tests and continuing activities as an operating public company to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities our stockholders may experience substantial dilution we may sell common stock convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time if we sell common stock convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders future sales of our common stock in the public market may cause our stock price to decline and impair our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our equity securities      there are a substantial number of shares of our common stock held by stockholders who owned shares of our capital stock prior to our initial public offering that may be able to sell in the public market sales by such stockholders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock we plan to register all shares of our common stock that we may issue pursuant to a long term incentive plan for employees shares issued by us upon exercise of options granted under such an equity plan will be eligible for sale in the public market if any of these holders cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock these sales also could impede our ability to raise capital in the future penny stock rules may make buying or selling our securities difficult which may make our stock less liquid and make it harder for investors to buy and sell our securities      if at any time in the future our shares of common stock are not listed for trading by nasdaq and begin to trade on an overthecounter market such as the overthecounter bulletin board or any quotation system maintained by otc markets inc trading in our securities will be subject to the secs penny stock rules and it is anticipated that trading in our securities will continue to be subject to the penny stock rules for the foreseeable future the securities and exchange commission has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions these rules require that any brokerdealer who recommends our securities to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors must prior to the sale make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to execute the transaction unless an exception is available the regulations require the delivery prior to any transaction involving a penny stock of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market in addition brokerdealers must disclose commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by these requirements may discourage brokerdealers from recommending transactions in our securities which could severely limit the liquidity of our securities and consequently adversely affect the market price for our securities if we do not qualify for an exchange we could face significant material adverse consequences including     •   a limited availability of market quotations for our securities     •   reduced liquidity with respect to our securities     •   a determination that our shares of common stock are penny stock which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock     •   a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company and     •   decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future therefore it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell any shares if they desire or need to sell them financial reporting obligations of being a public company in the united states are expensive and time consuming and may place significant demands on our management and other personnel      the additional obligations of being a public company in the united states require significant expenditures and may place significant demands on our management and other personnel including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices including those under the sarbanesoxley act the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements moreover despite recent reforms made possible by the jobs act certain provisions of which we are taking advantage of the reporting requirements rules and regulations will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company any changes that we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis or at all  we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares      we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase if any of our share price we are an emerging growth company and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies which could make our common stock less attractive to investors      we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  or the jobs act and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile we may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of i the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues   of  billion or more ii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or iii the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the securities and exchange commission we have elected to use the extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards      we have elected to use the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we i are no longer an emerging growth company or ii affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transaction period provided in section ab as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates we may be at risk of securities class action litigation      we may be at risk of securities class action litigation in the past life science companies have experienced significant stock price volatility particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals if we face such litigation it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources which could harm our business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives      as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a newly formed entity the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq have imposed various new requirements on public companies including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage item  financial information managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this current report this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the caption risk factors or in other parts of this current report  see cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements  critical accounting policies management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents we consider all cash on hand and in banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents at april   and  we had minimal bank balances we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents current financial market conditions have had the effect of restricting liquidity of cash management investments and have increased the risk of even the most liquid investments and the viability of some financial institutions  we do not believe however that these conditions will materially affect our business or our ability to meet our obligations or pursue our business plans accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received a trade receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than  days after the receivable becomes past due it is on nonaccrual status and accrual of interest is suspended property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation is provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the property generally from three to five years  repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred except when such repairs significantly add to the useful life or productive capacity of the asset in which case the repairs are capitalized patents and intangibles we have no patents and trademarks although we have licensed rights to our parents intellectual property as described herein longlived assets we review our longlived assets including patents whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  if such assets are considered to be impaired then the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets  fair value is determined by using cash flow analyses and other market valuations stockbased compensation stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the awards and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award for awards expected to vest income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence exists that there is an arrangement between us and our customers delivery of products sold or service has occurred the selling price to our customers is fixed and determinable with required documentation and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize as deferred revenue payments made in advance by customers for products not yet provided in instances where we have entered into license agreements with a third parties to use our technology within their product offering we recognize any base or prepaid revenues over the term of the agreement and any per occurrence or periodic usage revenues in the period they are earned research and development research and development costs are expensed when incurred  we have incurred no research and development costs concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable in the normal course of business we provide credit terms to our customers accordingly we will when we have receivables perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for possible losses weighted average shares basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income or loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period the computation of diluted earnings per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year plus the dilutive common stock equivalents that would rise from the exercise of stock options warrants and restricted stock units outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and the average market price per share during the period plus the effect of assuming conversion of the convertible debt the computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion or exercise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings advertising expenses we follow the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred  no advertising expenses were incurred for the years ended april   and  offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements executive overview on october   we entered into the license agreement with our parent codiagnostics and commenced operations designed to commercialize the licensed tests beginning with the pcr test for the zika virus  the licensed technology is encompassed in three issued patents and two pending patent applications described in the license agreement  those patents and applications are entitled rapid oligo probes detection primers for nucleic acid extension or amplification reactions nucleic acid hotstart technology primers for nucleic acid extension or amplification reactions and cooperative primers probes and applications thereof   the licensed tests are open architecture tests that can be performed on most of the thermocycler molecular diagnostic testing machines available in the marketplace  the costs of goods and delivery to the public will be much less than tests currently available since the licensed technology is not based on any other patented technology requiring licensing royalties to be able to design and employ tests in february  in response to the publicity surrounding the zika virus both in the united states and south and central america our parent commenced development of a pcr based zika test  the development of the zika test was completed within a onemonth period and was tested in our parents lab on synthetic zika virus where it showed the desired accuracy and specificity required to proceed with further validation studies preliminary to offering the zika test for commercial sale and distribution  in april  our parent completed a study at utah state university wherein our zika test was used in experimentation with live zika virus  the blind study of twelve different samples resulted in  detection of the live zika virus samples and almost as importantly amplification did not occur with samples containing dengue and yellow fever indicating that our test could differentiate between other flaviviruses which will be an important selling point in diagnosis of diseases with similar symptoms and application of correct treatments the license agreement grants to us the exclusive rights to make use sell license and otherwise commercialize the pcr tests for zika virus dengue yellow fever west nile virus japanese encephalitis and chikungunya   it also grants to us a nonexclusive right to sell our parents test for malaria  the license agreement requires that we pay an initial license fee of  upon execution of the license which has been paid and that we pay a royalty of  of the gross margin of the sales of the licensed tests  the license agreement obligates our parent to use up to  of the initial license fee for its lab and personnel to continue development of the licensed tests and covenants that we will have developed and lab verified tests for each of the pathogens covered by the license agreement ready for infield verification preliminary to sales and distribution of the licensed tests within  days of the payment of the initial license fee  our parents lab is iso certified iso  and  which will facilitate the parent in obtaining ceivd marking as an initial qualification for sales and distribution of the licensed tests throughout most of the world with the exception of the united states  our parent is in the process of assembling the files and documentation necessary for obtaining the ce marking for zika dengue and malaria according to the selfcertifying process available by the european commission upon receipt of the ce marking we will be able to commence sales of our licensed tests in countries accepting the ce marking not in the united states without further cumbersome governmental approvals  we have engaged the services of a sales representative who has commenced activities directed to presentation to government officials in latin american countries finally the license agreement provides that we will purchase the licensed tests from our parent and that the purchase price of the licensed tests can be no more than  greater than the manufacturing costs of the licensed tests effective october   we entered into a subscription agreement with an accredited investor for the sale of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of  per share or   the proceeds from the sale of our stock have allowed us to commence our business plan by paying the initial license fee and providing funds to commence marketing efforts results of operations for the years ended april   and april   net sales we had no sales of products in  or  cost of sales we had no sales of products in  or  o perating expenses for the fiscal year ended april   total operating expenses were  which included professional fees in the amount of  general and administrative expenses of  and rent in the amount of   for the fiscal year ended april   total operating expenses were  which included rent in the amount of  professional fees in the amount of  and general and administrative expenses of  interest expense we recorded no interest expense net loss we had net loss of  for the year ended april   compared to a net loss of  for the year ended april   liquidity and capital resources as of april   we had a cash balance of   following the funding of  received in october  pursuant to the subscription agreement referenced above we were able to pay the required license fee and to commence operations for the sale and marketing of our licensed tests  based on our currently stated budgets the cash available for operations should be able to sustain us for six months to a year depending our level of activity  it is our intention to seek additional investment capital during the next twelve months and to commence sales of our licensed tests to defray our costs and expenses of sales and marketing and continuing operations but there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us or available on terms favorable to us  there can be no assurance that we will be able to commence sales and distribution of our licensed tests or that the licensed tests will be accepted in the medical and testing community  if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund and develop our business as currently planned   item  properties   principal executive office we maintain offices currently at  s highland drive salt lake city utah  which includes two offices comprising approximately  square feet leased on a monthtomonth basis for  per month  we are seeking a different location which may include relocating with or adjacent to our parents corporate offices which are located in salt lake city utah  item  security ownership of

iso certification for all of the tests that the company will design develop and sell in the future  the iso certification allows us to apply for ce marking for sales of our products in countries accepting the ce marking not in the united states without further governmental approvals cdis diagnostics systems enable very rapid lowcost sophisticated molecular testing for organisms and genetic diseases by greatly automating historically complex procedures in both the development and administration of tests cdis newest technical advance involves a novel approach to pcr primer design cooperative primers that eliminates one of the key vexing issues of pcr amplification the exponential growth of primerdimer pairs which adversely interferes with identification of the target dna in addition cdi scientists have enhanced the understanding of the mathematics of dna test design so as to engineer a dna test and automate algorithms to screen millions of possible designs to find the optimum dna test design  cdis proprietary platform of codx™ technologies integrates and streamlines these steps as it analyzes biological samples codiagnostics codx™ portfolio of molecular diagnostics development products and tests represents a radical new advancement in the understanding of the molecular interactions of dna the company uses highly specialized proprietary cooperativetheory mathematics  leading to a revolutionary leap forward in the detection of infectious diseases genetic disorders and other conditions codx™ tests are a fraction of the cost of other dnabased tests designed for a new generation of affordable mobile pointofcare diagnostic devices and compatible with many other devices making stateoftheart diagnostics available anywhere in the world  including developing countries the company anticipates future revenues will be derived from licensing agreements and sharedrevenue contracts with biotech companies speedtomarket test development companion

which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has incurred losses and has not demonstrated the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our liabilities and sustain operations these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we experienced negative cash flow used in operations during the twelve months ending december   of  compared to negative cash flow used in operations for the twelve months ended december   of   the negative cash flow was met by cash reserves sales of our common stock and most recently from the issuances of short term debt the amount of our operating deficit could decrease or increase significantly depending on strategic and other operating decisions thereby affecting our need for additional capital  we expect our operating expenses will continue until we are able to generate revenue  to date we have met our working capital needs primarily through funds received from sales of our common stock and from convertible debt financings  until our operations become profitable we will continue to rely on proceeds received from external funding  we expect additional investment capital may come from i additional private placements of our common stock with existing and new investors and ii the private placement of other securities with investors similar to those that have provided funding in the past our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient income and cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and to obtain additional financing as may be required the company is actively seeking options to obtain additional capital and financing the company has commenced
