seeks current income as the primary objective with the potential for capital appreciation as a secondary objective principal investment strategy the trust seeks to provide current income with the potential for capital appreciation by investing in dividendpaying stocks of uslisted companies along with shares of exchangetraded funds  etfs  that invest substantially all of their assets in fixedincome securities the sponsor with the assistance of guggenheim partners investment management llc  gpim  an affiliate of guggenheim partners llc has selected the securities to be included in the trust s portfolio the common stocks in the trust are selected according to the quantitativelyselected us high dividend strategy described below the uslisted common stocks held the trust may include the common stocks of us and nonus companies of small mid or largecapitalizations certain of the common stocks included in the trust portfolio are issued by real estate investment trusts  reits  the sponsor and gpim believe that companies that distribute significant dividends on a consistent basis generally demonstrate strong financial strength and positive performance relative to their peers the common stocks selected according to the us high dividend strategy will constitute approximately  of the trust portfolio shares of etfs that invest substantially all of their assets in fixedincome securities will make up the remaining  of the trust portfolio the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio invest in a wide range of debt securities rated investmentgrade through below investmentgrade highyield below investmentgrade securities or junk bonds are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks than investmentgrade securities the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio will invest in debt securities with shortterm mediumterm and longterm maturities typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes finally the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio will also invest in debt securities issued by foreign companies including companies located in emerging markets  investment summary security selection us high dividend strategy approximately  of the trust portfolio will constitute the common stocks selected according to the us high dividend strategy these stocks were selected seven business days prior to the initial date of deposit the security selection date  using the security selection rules described below security selection rules in constructing the common stock component of the trust s portfolio securities will be selected based on the following fundamentally based quantitative criteria  initial universe start with an initial universe of all securities in the russell  index as of the security selection date  rank on fundamentals rank every company identified in the initial universe against other companies in the same sector as defined by global industry classification standard gics along each of the following reported financial metrics each ranking is determined as of the security selection date using the most recently reported information and uses a scale of  through   representing the highest scoring  in the sector and  representing the lowest scoring  in the sector return on assets as provided by sp compustat and calculated as latest four quarters of reported operating income divided by the average of most recent reported total assets and year ago reported total assets earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for the latest four quarters divided by enterprise value as provided by sp compustat enterprise value is determined by adding the equity market capitalization as of the most recent closing price with the total outstanding long term and short term debt as determined by the most recently available balance sheet and then subtracting any cash and short term investments as determined by the most recently available balance sheet yearoveryear growth in sales per share as provided by sp compustat trailing yearoveryear growth is the percentage change in sales pershare for the trailing  months versus the sales pershare from the prior  months sales pershare is the trailing  months of sales from the most recent trailing quarterly or semiannual filings whichever is most current divided by the end of period reported count of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share each financial metric will create a separate score so that every company will have three scores these three scores are averaged together to create one composite score for a company this composite score is used to rank the companies in the next step in order to determine the subuniverse of securities  define subuniverse reduce the initial universe of securities to a subuniverse that meets the following requirements with each requirement being applied independently to the investment summary  initial universe from the other requirements in this step as of the security selection date exclude the lowest ranked  of securities from the initial universe determined by the average of the three financial rankings described in step  exclude the  of the initial universe with the lowest trailing six month total return exclude securities which do not have a policy of regular periodic cash dividends quarterly semiannual or yearly or have omitted the most recent regular periodic cash dividend exclude securities with a market capitalization less than  million market capitalization is determined by the closing price as of the security selection date exclude securities with a liquidity of less than  million liquidity is determined by the median trading volume in us dollars looking back  days from the security selection date ie trading volume each day in shares multiplied by the closing price for the day as provided by factset research systems inc exclude business development companies as identified by bloomberg industry classification system subindustry exclude mortgage real estate investment trusts as identified by gics subindustry exclude securities that have a pending cash or stock merger and acquisition or bankruptcy which will lead to delisting the security such events will be determined by reviewing the announced merger and acquisition data from bloomberg exclude securities that are not one of the largest  companies of the initial universe by market capitalization per factset  selection select from the subuniverse the twentyfive top dividend yielding securities with higher rank given to larger market capitalization when yields are equal and equally weight these securities as of the security selection date so that each security represents  of the total trust portfolio selected securities must adhere to following strategy limits as of the security selection date maximum  weight in any gics sector minimum  in us incorporated companies once an investment limitation has been reached additional securities of the type that would violate the limitation will not be included in the trust and the next highest yielding security will be used please note that due to the fluctuating nature of security prices the weighting of an individual security or sector in the trust portfolio may change after the security selection date  investment summary fixedincome exchangetraded funds approximately  of the trust portfolio will constitute etfs that invest substantially all of their assets in fixedincome securities the sponsor with the assistance of gpim has selected fixedincome etfs believed to have the best potential for current income when selecting the etfs for the trust the sponsor considers a number of factors including but not limited to the size liquidity and daily trading volume the current dividend yield the strategy and investment objective the fixedincome securities held by the etf the expense ratio and the overlap of the underlying fixedincome securities held by the etfs guggenheim partners investment management llc guggenheim partners investment management llc is a subsidiary of guggenheim partners llc and an affiliate of the sponsor which offers financial services expertise within its asset management investment advisory capital markets institutional finance and merchant banking business lines clients consist of a mix of individuals family offices endowments foundations insurance companies pension plans and other institutions that together have entrusted the firm with supervision of more than  billion in assets a global diversified financial services firm guggenheim partners llc office locations include new york chicago los angeles miami boston philadelphia st louis houston london dublin geneva hong kong singapore mumbai and dubai exchangetraded funds etfs are investment pools that hold securities etfs provide an efficient and relatively simple way to invest in that they offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day etfs are often built like an index fund but trade like a stock on an exchange etfs generally offer advantages similar to those found in index funds such as low operating costs performance designed to track an index the potential for high tax efficiency and consistent investment strategies unlike conventional mutual funds etfs normally issue and redeem shares on a continuous basis at their net asset value in large specified blocks of shares known as creation units market makers large investors and institutions deal in creation units the trust will buy shares of the etf on the exchanges and will incur brokerage costs future trusts the sponsor may create future trusts that follow the same general investment strategy one such trust is expected to be available approximately three months after the trust s initial date of deposit the inception date  and upon the trust s termination if these future trusts are available you may be able to reinvest into one of the trusts at a reduced sales charge each trust is designed to be part of a longer term strategy the sponsor is also indirectly owned by guggenheim partners llc and is an affiliate of gpim investment summary  essential information as of the inception date

investments you may lose some or all of your investment in the trust no assurance can be given that the trust s investment objective will be achieved the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these securities prices can be volatile the value of your investment may fall over time market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include stock market movements purchases or sales of securities by the trust government policies litigation and changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of the securities issuer or even perceptions of the issuer units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the trust invests in shares of etfs etfs are investment pools that hold other securities the etfs in the trust may be passivelymanaged index funds that seek to replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index etfs are subject to various risks including management s ability to meet the fund s investment objective shares  investment summary of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors the underlying etf has management and operating expenses consequently you will bear not only your share of your trust s expenses but also the expenses of the underlying etfs by investing in etfs the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etfs the etfs are subject to annual fees and expenses including a management fee unitholders of the trust will bear these fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust see fees and expenses for additional information the trust is subject to an etf s index correlation risk to the extent that an underlying etf is an index tracking etf index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an etf will vary from the actual performance of the fund s target index known as tracking error this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spinoffs and timing variances the value of the fixedincome securities in the etfs will generally fall if interest rates in general rise typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes the trust may be subject to greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates an etf or an issuer of securities held by an etf may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments andor to declare distributions in the future may call a security before its stated maturity or may reduce the level of distributions declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units the financial condition of an etf or an issuer of securities held by an etf may worsen resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period economic conditions may lead to limited liquidity and greater volatility the markets for fixedincome securities such as those held by certain etfs may experience periods of illiquidity and volatility general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of fixedincome securities these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the securities held by an etf uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings investment summary  certain etfs held by the trust invest in securities that are rated below investmentgrade and are considered to be junk securities below investmentgrade obligations are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks and accordingly the risk of nonpayment or default is higher than with investmentgrade securities in addition such securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and more likely to receive early returns of principal certain etfs held by the trust may invest in securities that are rated as investmentgrade by only one rating agency as a result such splitrated securities may have more speculative characteristics and are subject to a greater risk of default than securities rated as investmentgrade by more than one rating agency certain etfs held by the trust invest in foreign securities investment in foreign securities presents additional risk foreign risk is the risk that foreign securities will be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as adverse economic currency political social or regulatory developments in a country including government seizure of assets excessive taxation limitations on the use or transfer of assets the lack of liquidity or regulatory controls with respect to certain industries or differing legal andor accounting standards certain etfs held by the trust invest in securities issued by companies headquartered or incorporated in countries considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance companies headquartered in emerging market countries may be exposed to greater volatility and market risk certain etfs held by the trust invest in senior loans borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due this nonpayment would result in a reduction of income to the applicable etf a reduction in the value of the senior loan experiencing nonpayment and a decrease in the net asset value of the etf although senior loans in which the etfs invest may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrower s obligation in the event of nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans in which the etfs invest generally are of below investmentgrade credit or junk quality may be unrated at the time of investment may be floatingrate instruments in which the interest rate payable  investment summary on the obligations fluctuates on a periodic basis based upon changes in the base lending rate generally are not registered with the securities and exchange commission  sec  or any state securities commission and generally are not listed on any securities exchange in addition the amount of public information available on senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for other types of assets the trust invests in securities issued by midcapitalization companies and certain etfs held by the trust may invest in securities issued by smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments share prices or dividend rates on the securities in the trust may decline during the life of the trust there is no guarantee that share prices of securities in the trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and if declared whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments the sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio the trust will generally hold and may when creating additional units continue to buy the same securities even though a security s outlook market value or yield may have changed see investment risks in part a of the prospectus and risk factors in part b of the prospectus for additional information who should invest you should consider this investment if the trust represents only a portion of your overall investment portfolio the trust is part of a longerterm investment strategy that may include the investment in subsequent portfolios if available and the trust is combined with other investment vehicles to provide diversification of method to your overall portfolio you should not consider this investment if you are uncomfortable with the trust s investment strategy you are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in securities or you want capital preservation investment summary  fees and expenses the amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect fees and expenses that you may incur based on a  unit price actual expenses may vary percentage of public amount per offering  investor fees price  invested initial sales fee paid on purchase    deferred sales fee  creation and development fee  maximum sales fees including creation and development fee   estimated organization costs amount per  units paid by the trust at the end of the initial offering period or after six months at the discretion of the sponsor  approximate annual fund  of public operating offering amount per expenses price   units trustee s fee   sponsor s supervisory fee evaluator s fee bookkeeping and administrative fee estimated other trust operating expenses  estimated acquired fund expenses  total    the initial sales fee provided above is based on the unit price on the inception date because the initial sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee  cd fee  as described below the percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales fee will vary as the unit price varies and after deferred fees begin despite the variability of the initial sales fee each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable maximum sales fee  the deferred sales fee is fixed at  per unit and is deducted in monthly installments of  per unit on the last business day of each month in august  and september  and  per unit on the last business day of october the percentage provided is based on a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period the entire deferred sales fee will be collected  the cd fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust the actual cd fee is  per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the close of the initial offering period which is expected to be approximately three months from the inception date the percentages provided are based on a  unit as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if the unit price exceeds  per unit the cd fee will be less than  of the public offering price if the unit price is less than  per unit the cd fee will exceed  of the public offering price however in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed  of a unitholder s initial investment  based on  units with a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date  the estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust size of approximately  million because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts if the trust does not reach such estimated size or falls below the estimated size over its life the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected in some cases the actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts reflected other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees  although not an actual trust operating expense the trust and therefore the unitholders of the trust will indirectly bear similar operating expenses of the etfs held by the trust in the estimated amount provided above estimated etf expenses are based upon the net asset value of the number of etf shares held by the trust per unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the etfs for the most recent fiscal year unitholders will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying etfs were held directly please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service provider to certain etfs held by your trust and therefore certain fees paid by your trust to such etfs will be paid to the sponsor or an affiliate for its services to such etfs  investment summary example this example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds in the example we assume that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every other year at a reduced sales charge the trust s operating expenses do not change and the trust s annual return is  your actual returns and expenses will vary based on these assumptions you would pay these expenses for every  you invest  year  years   years  years  these amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment the example does not consider any brokerage fees the trust pays or transaction fees that brokerdealers may charge for processing redemption requests see expenses of

you can buy units of your trust on any business day by contacting your financial professional public offering prices of units are available daily on the internet at the unit price includes the value of the securities organization costs the maximum sales fee which includes an initial sales fee a deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee and cash and other net assets in the portfolio we often refer to the purchase price of units as the offer price or the public offering price we must receive your order to buy units prior to the close of the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time to give you the price for that day if we receive your order after this time you will receive the price computed on the next business day value of the securities the sponsor serves as the evaluator of the trust the evaluator  we cause the trustee to determine the value of the securities as of the close of the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open the evaluation time  pricing the securities the value of securities is generally determined by using the last sale price for securities traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market in some cases we will price a security based on the last asked or bid price in the overthecounter market or by using other recognized pricing methods we will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate if applicable the trustee or its designee will value foreign securities primarily traded on foreign exchanges at their fair value which may be other than their market prices if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate the trustee determined the initial prices of the securities shown in trust portfolio for your trust in this prospectus such prices were determined as described above at the close of the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later organization costs during the initial offering period part of your purchase price includes a per unit amount sufficient to reimburse us for some or all of the costs of creating your trust these costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement and legal documents legal fees federal and state registration fees the portfolio consulting fee if applicable and the initial fees and expenses of the trustee your trust will sell securities to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months at the discretion of the sponsor organization costs will not exceed the estimate set forth under fees and expenses transactional sales fee you pay a fee when you buy units we refer to this fee as the  understanding your investment transactional sales fee the transactional sales fee has both an initial and a deferred component and is  of the public offering price based on a  unit the percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on the inception date because the transactional sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the cd fee the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the unit price varies the transactional sales fee does not include the cd fee which is described under expenses of the trust in part b of the prospectus and in fees and expenses in part a of the prospectus initial sales fee based on a  unit the initial sales fee is initially  of the public offering price the initial sales fee which you will pay at the time of purchase is equal to the difference between the maximum sales fee  of the public offering price and the sum of the maximum remaining deferred sales fees and the cd fee initially  per unit the dollar amount and percentage amount of the initial sales fee will vary over time deferred sales fee we defer payment of the rest of the transactional sales fee through the deferred sales fee  per unit you pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem units the trust may sell securities to meet the trust s obligations with respect to the deferred sales fee thus no assurance can be given that the trust will retain its present size and composition for any length of time in limited circumstances and only if deemed in the best interests of unitholders the sponsor may delay the payment of the deferred sales fee from the dates listed under fees and expenses reducing your sales fee we offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the maximum sales fee you pay it is your financial professional s responsibility to alert us of any discount when you order units since the deferred sales fee and the cd fee are a fixed dollar amount per unit your trust must charge the deferred sales fee and the cd fee per unit regardless of any discounts however when you purchase units of your trust if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total maximum sales fee is less than the fixed dollar amount of the deferred sales fee and the cd fee the sponsor will credit you the difference between your maximum sales fee and the sum of the deferred sales fee and the cd fee at the time you buy units by providing you with additional units large purchases you can reduce your maximum sales fee by increasing the size of your investment investors who make large purchases are entitled to the following sales charge reductions sales charge reductions as a  of the public purchase amount offering price less than                or more  aggregate unit purchases of any guggenheim funds trust by the same person on any single day from any one brokerdealer qualify for a purchase level you can include these purchases as your own for purposes of this aggregation purchases by your spouse or children under the age of  living in the same household and understanding your investment  purchases by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts the discounts described above apply only during the initial offering period there can be no assurance that the sponsor will create future trusts with investment strategies similar to your trust or that may fit within your investment parameters advisory and fee accounts we eliminate your transactional sales fee for purchases made through registered investment advisers certified financial planners or registered brokerdealers who charge periodic fees in lieu of commissions or who charge for financial planning or for investment advisory or asset management services or provide these services as part of an investment account where a comprehensive wrap fee is imposed a fee account  this discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary market your
