now why thousands of small business owners choose incfile scroll down deciding on a company formation service can be very confusing and seemingly overwhelming process there are a multitude of companies on the web that perform the function of starting new entities and each has its own unique offerings and packages that can potentially you make feel that they are comparing apples to oranges although our modesty prohibits us from claiming that we are the best listed below are some of the distinguishing features that we think separate us from other companies  value – nobody gives you more for less  more first and foremost our basic price of a new entity formation is  plus state filing fees and although you may find companies claiming to do it for less you have to be aware that many of these companies only prepare the documents and mail them to you our service is end to end we prepare your documents file them with the state and only deliver everything to you only after the company has been filed and if for any reason we cannot get your filed we will issue a full refund to you less  registered agent service  st year free  more each of our  packages include a  free year of registered agent service if you do not need us to act as your registered agent you are not obliged to do so and you can name yourself or whomever you wish after the first year you have the option to renew the registered agent service for the annual price of  we do not ever under any circumstance charge your payment card automatically if you decide to renew you will need to enter the site and process the renewal with your payment information we only point this out because there are companies that will offer the registered agent service for a pre specified time lets say  weeks or  months and then auto charge your payment card for whatever there annual fee is and then keep charging every year thereafter going forward making the assumption that the company is still active or that you have not changed the agent on file with the state less  transparency  more we have dedicated much time and effort to make sure that you know exactly what not only the final cost of your formation will be throughout the order process but we also make sure that you are aware of any additional post filing fees that the state may require of you after the formation is complete on the first page of our order process you will see a link at the towards the top of the page that will present itself after the state and entity type have been selected titled state compulsory filing requirements we strongly urge you to review this link as many states ie nevada exercise very expensive fees that are due within a close proximity to the entity being filed the link will also inform you what the annual fees and requirements for keeping the company active will be as most states require the entity to file document known as an annual report or franchise tax we will let you know when it is due and what it will cost less  notifications  more all of our packages include lifetime notification alerts as long as we have a valid email we will also send email alerts informing our clients of important filing dates regarding their entities these emails are sent on a schedule that will allow you to know when an annual report or franchise tax report is due so that you can avoid missing important filing dates less  internal documents  more it is very important that clients understand that the company formation process is more than just filing the articles of organization  incorporation with the state depending on the state in which the company is filed some states may not list the members of an llc or the directors and shareholders of a corporation we create custom operating agreements for the lllc which will list the name and percentage of ownership for each member in addition we also create custom bylaws and organizational meeting minutes for corporations which list the names of the directors and shareholders as well as the number of shares that each shareholder owns the internal documents stated above are in addition to other custom documents as well such as the statement of the organizer  incorporator and banking resolutions if changes need to be made to any of these documents we can also provide them to our clients in digital format so that they can be customized as needed less  electronic copies  more we know that sometimes even the best organized person can misplace or lose important documents therefore we make sure to keep copies of every filing in digital format should you need it in the future less  privacy  more you can always rest assured that your personal information will remain such we do not sell or solicit your information to any person or outside business the only we will share any of your personal information with any outside agency is through the receipt of a subpoena although we do have partners that we encourage our clients to use they will only be provided your contact information if you personally opt in we also do not store any payment card information in our database and scrape any other sensitive information from our site ie social security numbers from the database as soon as the order is completed less  sales practices  more we do not employ sales people any person that you speak to on the telephone regarding information about a new formation will always be knowledgable long time employee or on of the owners of the company we only provide you with clear concise information that will allow you to make the best decision for your needs even though it is much more profitable for us we never have or will encourage our clients to form entities in states outside of the location where the business is physically located as this practice adds further complexity to the process if additional steps are not taken and can leave the client exposed in the event of litigation or the pursuance of additional licensing in the state of location we would strongly urge you to be wary of companies that compel you to form a business entity in this state or that state as this can have detrimental consequences if the additional steps are not taken follow the link for more information regarding this less  experience  more when we entered this industry in  the landscape of competitors was completely different from the companies we see today through hard work and determination we weathered the incremental business cycles that all business are subject to and are still here today we have formed well over  companies and the majority of our staff has been with us since the beginning of the companies existence what that means for you is that you can rest assured that your documents will be handled by individuals who have vast knowledge and experience in filing business entities and are familiar with the nuances of each of the  states less  humility  more at the end of the day we know that we are not perfect we make mistakes sometimes its difficult to reach us on the phones and speak to a live person however if we do make a an error or fall short of expectations you can rest assured that we will do everything within in reason to ensure that you leave a satisfied customer and have a positive experience our goal is to provide to provide the most value at the lowest cost and the cost for that is that we cannot staff a pleather of call takers to man the phones if you do need to reach us immediately the best way to contact us for a prompt response is to use the messaging tool found at
