more bribes a cost of doing business exsecurency employee tells uk court rba subsidiary approved bribes for nigerian official uk the securency scandal in rio de janeiro british businessman peter chapman was thrown into a living hell share share on facebook share share on twitter tweet link peter chapman outside the court in london photo nick miller after his arrest in late  he awaited extradition on corruption charges for almost six months in the ary franco prisonthis prison is notorious brazils then justice minister jose eduardo cardozo once said he would prefer death to serving time there share share on facebook share share on twitter tweet link david john ellery former company secretary for securency in   photo arsineh houspian in  the united nations subcommittee on the prevention of torture visited ary franco then told the brazilian government it should be immediately closed downchapman and his fellow inmates sat in dark filthy stuffy cells that were infested with cockroaches and other insects and were so overcrowded that inmates took turns sleeping on the floor advertisement in some cells sewage seeped from leaky pipes in the ceiling and there were more immediate health concerns cellblocks were divided along the lines of the factions – huge brazilian organised crime groups – and inmates had to sign an agreement assuming responsibility for their own safety in that regard you will now receive updates from business am newsletter business am newsletter get the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox by submitting your email you are agreeing to fairfax medias terms and conditions and privacy policy  chapman was not unfamiliar with difficult dangerous situations he had made his living and boasted considerable expertise as an entrepreneur in some of the more adventurous corners of african and south american commerce share share on facebook share share on twitter tweet link british prime minister david cameron second right was caught on camera telling the queen nigeria and afghanistan were fantastically corrupt photo ap but he was also used to the finer things in life he had rubbed shoulders with diplomats politicians and business leaders he had worked hard and travelled the world and put together a tidy nest eggthen over three months in early  shortly before retiring for health reasons to live in his adopted home town of rio he made a terrible lifechanging mistake in pursuit of a juicy business deal he bribed an official in one of the most corrupt countries on earth nigeria share share on facebook share on twitter link some of the polymer notes printed by securency photo michael howard and so he found himself rubbing shoulders with faction members in the overcrowded ary franco cells his fellow inmates pasty hunched many with festering lifethreatening injuries deliberately kneecapped by arresting policemany were young men who told him they expected to be dead before their th birthday murdered by rivals before they could claim their factional pension and retireover sleepless nights in this nightmare new home chapman was left to ponder his crime which he furiously denied to the very last moment of his trial in londons southwark crown court over the past month and a halfhis trial coincided with an international summit on corruption which was cited by his sentencing judge bizarrely just a day before his jury reached their verdict british prime minister david cameron was overheard telling the queen that nigeria was fantastically corrupt a comment that unwittingly almost derailed the trial and which chapman feared had finally turned the wavering jury against himbut the trial had a bittersweet end most sentencing judges find stern words for the defendant but judge michael grieve qc seemed equally angry at chapmans former employer australian banknote company securency and its senior management who he said had pushed chapman into corruptionon wednesday chapman had shaken his head at the four guilty verdicts on thursday he was given a sentence that effectively set him free due to time served in ary franco and londons shabby old wandsworthhe gave a little nod in effect he had been told you have done wrong but you have suffered enoughchapman  hails from the picturesque buckinghamshire town of aylesbury before joining securency he had worked as a sales manager for a company that printed lottery tickets for south america and in their banknote printing divisionhe learnt the business of banknotes from the high level of how they worked to oil an economy right down to the inkstained practicality of a mint floorthen in mid he got a call from hugh brown a man who used to work for the same company as chapman but was now a senior sales executive at securency a subsidiary of the reserve bank of australiasecurency had a golden goose the patent for a sophisticated plastic polymer a oneofakind substance that could be used to replace paper banknotes with durable hardtocounterfeit plasticit was invented by the csiro then securency was formed to commercialise the product securency wanted to polymerise the world chapman said in evidencebut he wasnt overly impressed with the way it was runit was very strange he said when i first got there i was struck by the fact it was almost like a virtual company it didnt have the normal core functions i was used toit was like all the staff were almost like freelancers like satellites doing their own thing i wasnt used to that and i didnt like thatit was horribly inefficient … they had some very good plans but not much idea how to execute those planschapman was made the director of business development for africa then two years later in  promoted to director of regional sales for africamost of his efforts were concentrated on nigeriait was by far the most dangerous country of all securencys clients and it got worse during chapmans time there expats were often kidnapped the roads and even many hotels were not for the faint hearted he said in  the australian high commission and the department of foreign affairs and trade withdrew nonessential staffbut chapman stuck in there because the upside was huge when just one banknote the  naira was converted to plastic it was worth tens of millions of euros a year for securency and chapman took a nice commission on top of his salaryand if he could get the other denominations too it would be a bonanza and not just in nigeria as chapman said in evidence if we could show polymer could be printed in the worst banknote patch in africa and through that it became one of the best banknote printers in africa that would be an enormously good example to show the rest of the worldbut he had made contact with his own official in his own patch his ace in the hole an influential employee at nigerias mintdue to a court order in the uk fairfax media must not identify the man whom we shall call mr nthey had met first in london around  at a business seminar in a dismal holiday inn in ealing off the awhen they met again in nigeria they became close friends and business allies chapman was regularly in contact with him they exchanged emails chapman even drafted emails for the manchapman said his relationship with mr n was valuable good contacts and good intelligence were vital to good businesswhat were your reasons for having a relationship with mr n chapman was asked by his lawyer during the trialthere was a very long pausethere are a number chapman eventually said we had to work together we liked each other we got on very well our interests our strategies perfectly aligned … he was a very useful sounding board for crosschecking what id heard from other sources and vice versa hed bounce things off mewe were a similar age had a similar sense of humour we both liked football he liked chelsea i liked tottenham we used to recommend books to each other literature we had similar tastes a whole range of personal similaritieshis lawyer david spens qc asked chapman did you trust himyes chapman repliedbut one aspect of chapmans relationship with mr n went beyond normal friendship several times he arranged for large sums of money to be transferred to the man payments that did not appear in chapmans regular meticulous expense reports nor were they explained by any business contract in evidence in the trialat the trial chapmans defence was that he was repaying cash loans that mr n had provided him in local currency in nigeriachapman said nigeria was very much a cashbased society at the time and credit cards were almost unusable outside major tourist hotelswhenever you go out and about you need cash thats what you had to carry all of the time he said i always had lots of it to hand chapman claimed that the easiest way for him to get cash was from his good friend mr nhe would borrow it for business expenses such as travel or drivers or a security detail then a while later he claimed he would repay itum we had a conversation i was having trouble getting naira easily chapman said on the witness stand he said oh i always have naira and it suits me to have it in the uk or elsewhere and thats how it startedi saw nothing wrong with itthe bribes – which is what they in fact were the jury decided rather than loan repayments – went through an odd route and ended up with mr n over three months in early the first bribe for which he was found guilty moved from securency to a company called spt ltd based in the seychelles which chapman had helped set up and was now acting as securencys agent in nigeria from there it went to swingaxle chapmans own company which he also set up in the seychelles from there £  went into the uk bank account of mr n in one bank transfer document it was described as a spare parts consignmentthe second bribe of us  went from securency to spt to swingaxle it jumped through two of swingaxles seychelles bank accounts then ended up at a company in nigeria that mr n had set upthe company was a front it had no obvious connection to mr n and he had used signatures and photographs of other people to set up its bank account however he was the beneficial ownerchapman said he never questioned why mr n had asked the money to be paid therethe third and fourth bribes of us each ended up at that company also however they had an unclear origin it may have been chapmans own money sourced from a pair of offshore trusts of which chapman was the protectorthese last two bribes appear not to have come from securency at least not directly the court heard evidence that by this stage  fairfax media had broken the news of a bribery scandal at the company and securency was getting leery about sending undocumented payments to its agentsthe jury might have believed chapmans story about cash loans from mr n the members found him not guilty on two counts of alleged earlier bribes in  and  which chapman had said were the repayment of loans to mr nhowever they decided by majority verdict the four payments in early  were bribesthat period was a crucial time for securencys business in nigeria they were on the verge of closing the long soughtafter deal to convert three other denomination notes into plastic and they were keen to convert a letter of intent from the nigerian mint into a firm orderthey were also under huge pressure from the company board to get orders on the books and they were passing that pressure on to chapmanthe prosecution said the orders might naturally have happened anyway but the bribes made it happen more quicklyemails between company executives to which chapman was privy were frantic we are fast running out of time and have a board meeting at the beginning of march said one it is becoming a very critical situation for usanother email talked about the need to get the big one across the linein one email to his superiors about this time chapman said enigmatically there are some aspects to this i need to discuss but essentially this particular rabbit will jump out of the same battered hat again details to follow but they are likely to be along the same lines as the last rabbitanother email was also highlighted by the prosecution about the time that two of the bribes were paid chapman promised to shake the burning bush again while talking about mr nexcellent progress came the reply from management in australia next week could be the turning point for our business and i await with bated breath please do all you can to finalise the order from the mint as things are getting very tight herewhen the order finally came through in march for the new denominations they were ecstatic dont you just love it when the plan comes to fruition – well done squirethe key witness for the prosecution was david ellery securencys former principal financial officerthe defence worked hard to destroy ellerys credibility with the jurythey showed he had lied before in trying to avoid responsibility for his own role in securencypaid bribes in other countries and they pointed out that ellery had promised to give evidence against other securency employees as part of a bargain with police to downgrade charges against himin his closing address defence barrister mr spens said it was an absolutely classic case of a witness prepared to implicate others to save his own precious skin – there is no good reason why you should believe himbut in the end the jury appears to have believed ellerys evidence over chapmans and it was highly incriminatingellery testified about a meeting where chapman was somewhat upset because the majority of the sales for the year had come out of his territory nigeria – he felt an unreasonable amount of pressure was being put on him to achieve sales ellery said discussion focused on bringing forward an order from next year so the forward order book would look stronger than was actually the casechapman indicated that there would be a cost involved he saidinitially that cost was thought to perhaps be taking some nigerians on a tour to australia spoiling them with firstclass airfaresbut in a subsequent phone conversation chapman indicated he had agreed to pay an official a sum of money ellery said securency would reimburse the cost of the bribemy recollection of the conversation was that the payment was taken as a cost of doing business … at the time there was disappointment but i agreed to proceed with ithearing this evidence chapman laughed in the dockin sentencing ellery judge grieve said a significant factor in mitigating chapmans sentence was the role of securency managementi accept that you were put under considerable pressure by your superiors to achieve sales and you complained about that to them judge grieve said adding this was a significant factor in mitigating the sentencesenior management from the managing director down gave you the goahead for the bribes he said the prosecution case throughout was that you acted with their encouragement or at least their connivancechapman usually animated in the dock sat stoney faced as the sentence was read out  months taking into account the  days he had already spent in jail in brazil and britain it meant he need serve no more jail timeafter an afternoon of prison bureaucracy he walked out of the court a convicted criminal but a free man another chapter of the securency

that allows much more depth of information advertising show more editorial reviews zom zoms the fifth edition of the classic rogets international thesaurus includes more than  words and phrases up from  in the fourth edition grouped according to ideas into  classes and further subdivided into  major categories in this completely revised and reorganized edition  new major categories have been added including such topics as substance abuse and computer science in order to make this resource more reflective of modern society within the  major categories ideas are further broken down into paragraphs each of which reflects more discrete connotative or partofspeech groupings in an effort to more clearly distinguish between groups of synonyms within a paragraph synomyms that are closest in meaning to each other are offered in clusters that are set off with semicolons which indicate changes in sense or application also foreign and technical terms are identified by labels in angle brackets eg starets  animalia  also helpful are the use of boldface for synonyms most often used for the idea being represented lists of words that fit within a category but do not have synomyms eg a list of phobias is found under phobias by name a list of various football plays can be found under football plays and calls see references to the number at which a listed synonym can be found as a headword and the inclusion of quotations referenced to a person but not to a source that refer to a guideword or category the comprehensive index refers back to category and paragraph allowing the reader to zero in to the right spot on the page since the thesaurus is arranged topically it stands quite apart from other thesauruses that are arranged alphabetically other differences are also noted in terms of sheer number of synonyms provided rogets has more than either websters new dictionary of synomyms merriamwebster  or the random house thesaurus college edition random  however both websters and random house provide antonyms and websters also provides contrasting and analogous words additionally unlike rogets which does not define guidewords or synonyms both websters and random house provide some definitions random house uses guidewords in sentences and websters provides explanatory paragraphs in which major synonyms are clearly differentiated in terms of their connotations both websters and rogets also provide quotations that help to clarify or expand the nuances of listed words finally in terms of ease of use although the alphabetically arranged sources require less page turning rogets ideabased groupings facilitate creative generation of synonyms as well as easier browsing once one has found the correct classified area the fifth edition of rogets is a handsome product whose larger print and uncluttered pages are unintimidating for junior high or high school public and academic libraries the sheer number of words presented in rogets makes it clearly a first purchase however since it seems to be geared toward people who know the english language it should probably sit next to websters new dictionary of synonyms whose clear distinctions between fewer words make it a first purchase for nonnative speakers as well as less sophisticated or younger writers and as rogets urges all thesauruses should be used in conjunction with a good dictionary in order to ensure that a selected synonym which may be unfamiliar to the user is appropriate show more product details isbn  publisher harpercollins publishers publication date  edition description older edition pages  product dimensions w x h x d related subjects english dictionaries  thesauri read an excerpt publishers prefacelike all great reference books rogets international thesaurus® is the product of continuous improvement and longterm investment the process began almost two centuries ago in  when dr peter mark roget began compiling a list of useful words for his own conveniencethere have been glossaries and word lists since literature began the revolutionary achievement of dr roget a physician with a penchant for organization was his development of a brand new principle the grouping of words according to ideas this mechanism eliminates the need for groping through the entire alphabet posed by word books arranged in dictionary form ie alphabetically thus greatly increasing the efficiency of locating just the right word or expression for a particular circumstance when in  roget published the first book ever to realize this concept with thoroughness and precision he called it a thesaurus from the greek and latin meaning treasury or storehouse and thesaurus it has remained to this dayso successful was rogets thesaurus of english words and phrases classified and arranged so as to facilitate the expression of ideas and assist in literary composition that a second edition followed one year later in  by dr rogets death in  there had been no less than twentyeight editions and printingsthomas y crowell acquired the thesaurus from rogets son dr john lewis roget and published the first crowell edition in  rogets international thesaurus® remained within the crowell publishingfamily for the next nearly one hundred years each subsequent edition introduced more efficient and useful features all of which have contributed to the quality of the present edition over the years tens of thousands of new words and phrases were added the coverage of foreign expressions increased and the scope of the book expanded to include slang and useful quotations a recent innovation was the numbering of the paragraphs for the users convenience by  when the fourth edition was published by harper  row rogets international thesaurus® had become a greatly expanded and improved book yet one which still retained rogets brilliant organizationit is with a very special sense of pride that we present this fifth edition of rogets international thesaurus® along with the addition of new words and phrases considerable updating and refinements in format and style the most significant changes in this fifth edition are the rearrangement of the categories and the introduction of new ones to enable fuller coverage of terms of our times dr robert l chapman revising editor for this new edition explains the details and reasoning behind these changes in his
