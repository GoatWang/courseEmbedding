references hannah terhune articles payments  consults offering legal tax  business services to investment managers  hedge funds worldwide due diligence on my hedge fund as a hedge fund manager expect an inspection potential investors  you hope that your presentation of yourself and your trading track record will attract investors but could your efforts be undermined by errors in your former employment or regulatory records  what would your past paper trail tell someone who does not know you  there is external information about you and you must make sure that it is correct put yourself under review  find out how potential investors will see you by performing a dry run  let us perform due diligence on you and then review the results   why not use our professionals to investigate you and your hedge fund before bad paper turns investors away  contact us new to hedge fund managementas a new hedge fund you may not have yet experienced a due diligence review  understandably you may feel daunted by the comprehensive nature of the due diligence process  by hiring qualified professionals you can get a good look at what due diligence would produce on your background  our thirdparty objective duediligence services coupled with our industryleading legal services can help you get some perspective on your overall appeal as a hedge fund managerthe meaning of due diligence due diligence refers to a comprehensive investigation andor audit of a potential investment that serves to confirm as much as possible all material facts in regard to a purchase or sale  generally due diligence refers to the care a reasonable person should take to obtain all the material facts before entering into an agreement or transaction with another party  due diligence provides an investor some security in an otherwise risky environment  you can do little to control market forces politics regional instability and global economic conditions when you invest  however there is something you can do to keep from being a victim of deception check the qualifications and background of a hedge fund manager before giving him your money fraud is often the reason a hedge fund goes under  as history shows investors have all often entrusted their money to hedge fund managers who are irresponsible or even criminal  before explaining how due diligence can reduce the risk of fraud lets revisit a few common scenarioshedge fund manager covers up losses in this situation suppose that the hedge fund manager has a clean record  he is reputable and has set up the fund to industry standards with all the appropriate documentation and disclosures he accepts client funds and begins investing the capital responsibly according to his duties  however an overleveraged trade or overly concentrated investment goes south  the hedge fund manager fears that if he dutifully reports such losses his investors will leave  so he devises a plan to earn the money back with future trades  until such returns are realized he will produce false financial statements  of course he has to use a higher leverage ratio because of the lower investment balance and the trades are highly risky they too perform poorly  but because of the forged statements you as an investor feel satisfied  naturally one would assume that a legitimate request for a withdrawal of funds would expose the cashstrapped operation  not necessarily  due to a false positive performance record the hedge fund manager attracts new investors and simply pays a withdrawal request with new investors money  will you be holding the bag when the operation fallshedge fund manager supports lavish lifestyle with investors money in this situation a hedge fund manager with a shady financial past sets up a hedge fund based on a stellar career in the investing world  he sets up the fund according to industry standards and convinces investors that he can generate excellent returns  he never invests the funds and instead he withdraws money for personal use living a lavish lifestyle  statements are faked to show positive earnings the manager promises a strictly monitored and audited operation  however the audits are never done or are done under an unknown auditors name  worse yet the investors never ask for audited financials  eventually the fund is exposed  hindsight reveals the shady past of the managerthe securities violations bankruptcy and open judgments  it turns out that the stellar career never existed as he simply worked entrylevel positions and was fired  this is all easily revealed during the investigation and legal process that follows  could you have avoided this  need help contact ushedge fund loses large percentage of capital closes operations in this final scenario everything is handled in a generally legitimate manner  statements are accurate and sent out in a timely fashion  the only problem is that they paint a gloomy picture  investors receive informal promises and indications that the market is looking good or that the strategy is expected to pan out  instead more money is lost investors lose confidence and withdraw and the fund closes operations  most of your money has disappeared and you have little or no legal recourse  you relied upon a colleagues advice as well as the fact that a wellknown investor had a position in the fund  you had confidence in the manager from what you had heard but later find out that the manager had little to prove that he could invest wisely you learn too late that a significant percentage of all executives misrepresent accomplishments on their resumes  often they omit various positions as opposed to embellishing them  sometimes they include a degree from an unaccredited online school could this have been found out before investinginvestment manager is the investment manager registered as an investment adviser with sec  if yes review form adv  review entire form and in particular look for number of personnel employed number of clients and funds under management  also look for whether any advisee clients are sec registered investment companies or non registered funds and whether the adviser has had problems with regulators has other business activities etc  does the investment manager have conflicts of interest with the fund and does the manager have any controls in place to manage those conflicts  is the investment manager registered with any state regulatory authority as an investment adviser if so review forms  if not registered as investment adviser with sec or state level higher level of scrutiny required examine the investment managers articles of organization and certificates of formation jurisdiction of organization location of office and ein letter from the irs note that it is very rare for the investment manager of an onshore fund to be organized in a foreign jurisdictionexamine the operating agreement of the investment manager what licenses do individuals employed with the investment manager possess  many management personnel possess a securities license such as series  registered representative of a brokerdealer because the manager is itself registered with the sec as a brokerdealer  if individuals are investment advisers they will be required to have the series  or equivalent  what are the educational and professional credentials of the personnel  verify credentials listed what institutions of higher learning did they attend  do they have a graduate degree in business or economics sometimes engineering mathematics medicine  are they a cfa certified financial analyst the standard industry credential for professional investment managers  what are the employment histories of the personnel  were they employed at other hedge funds  if so verify employment and review the history of those funds  were they employed at major financial institutions and if so in what capacity  examine the investment managers past performance  obtain photo identification from the manager drivers license passport etc  perform background checks on the manager and the principals of the manager  useful places to look are dun  bradstreet report credit check and knowxcom background check with information on bankruptcies liens lawsuits judgments and uccs  be sure to obtain permission from each individual to run a background check check on court decisions against the manager and its principals  get state and federal filings on the manager  do a search on factiva dow jones news retrieval service or similar service to obtain media articles about the manager and its principals get at least three references from the manager inquire as to who the references are and conduct further due diligence hedge fund due diligence is there a way to sniff out fraud before it is too late  the problem is that those who are good at deception know how to appear honest  fortunately there is a way to discover fraud  with expertise and access to records and information you can uncover the past of a hedge fund manager  you can employ a background check firm a private investigator or perform your own record checks online these tools may reveal information on the background of the hedge fund manager  but is that enough  even honest hedge fund managers fail  and the signs of failure are often clear in advance  but these signs may not be clear to a general background check firm to a private investigator or to anyone who is not an expert on hedge fundsthis is where we come in we are a wellknown industry leader in the areas of hedge fund development compliance operations and tax  we know how a hedge fund should be set up  we know who should be registered and with what authority  we know what hedge fund managers can and cannot doand what they should be doing  to put it plainly we are fully equipped and knowledgeable in every aspect of a hedge fund operation  we can provide you with a complete due diligence package that goes well beyond a simple background check  we know what to look for and can help you avoid large losses  we can help before you invest or after  we know how to uncover inconsistencies that are signs of trouble hedge funds that turn into frauds cannot bear the scrutiny of our due diligence process  your investment is too valuable to see it squandered by unsavory individuals due diligence is a small price to pay to avoid the substantial loss and suffering that can result from fraud a little due diligence goes a long way  contact hedge fund attorney hannah terhune for assistanceorganizational issues what is the funds mailing address  physical address  if there are multiple addresses  for the fund or if the fund shares an address or office space with another fund or another  business or company require an explanation and obtain document written contract that enables sharingis the fund registered with the sec the state  request a copy of form d as filed with sec and relevant states  verify the form d or state regulatory equivalent filings in all statesis the fund domestic or offshore  if offshore determine whether the manager andor fund are subject to local regulatory oversight and if so obtain regulatory filings  ask about the prime broker or other custodians and administratorsin what state is the fund organized  most domestic funds are organized in delaware although some are organized in nevada and occasionally in another statewhat is the form of organization  domestic funds are typically organized either as a limited partnership in which the manager is the general partner and the investors are limited partners or as a limited liability company in which the manager is the managing member and the investors are nonmanaging members  obtain fund formation documents eg articles of organization or articles of association  request a state certificate of good standing from the fund  this may also be obtained from the state of formation  contact the state to verify the certificate’s status and request that the certificate be mailed directly to youis the fund reputable  find out where the funds and securities are kept  if not new york london or some  other major financial center this may be a warning sign  inquire about the lawyers and  the accountants there is a limited universe of professionals in each offshore jurisdiction  and use of professionals who are not wellknown raises concernsoperational concerns what are the terms of the fund performance fees withdrawal restrictions  does the manager have the right to more than  of the profits regardless of  performance  if so think twice about investing  does the managers right to profits  require that it first exceed a stated return to the investors termed a hurdle rate  if not  think twice about investingdoes the agreement have a high water mark  if not it is probably inadvisable to invest since this may indicate unfairness on the part of the manageris it a fund of funds  if so there are special considerations the most important of which concerns fees and compensation to the two levels of managers obtain a copy of the investment advisory agreement between the fund and the  investment adviser  verify that it conforms to the stated purpose in the funds offering  memorandumdoes the agreement permit an investor to withdraw all or part of its capital  if so on  what conditions must the investor give written notice such as  days or  days and  how often in each year can an investor withdrawindustry standards vary  in some  cases withdrawal four times a year is permitted in other cases only on december   after giving notice  days in advance  if the agreement contains very restrictive  withdrawal rights think twice about investingdoes the fund have an engagement letter with an attorney on file  obtain a copy and  contact the attorney to verify the client relationshipdoes the fund have an engagement letter with an auditor on file  obtain a copy and  verify the client relationship  obtain copies of the last three years audited financial statements directly from the  auditor  do not accept copies provided by fund  review them to see whether they agree  with what the manager has represented to be the funds results  obtain copies of filed tax returns for last two years directly from the funds accounting firm  do not accept summaries provided by the fund  tax returns should include schedules and statements except schedule k which discloses each investors position in the fund  compare results to audited financials and reconcile tax results with financials through unrealized gainloss  determine whether for tax purposes the fund is treated as a trader in securities favorable treatment or as an investor unfavorable treatment if the fund is a fund of funds does the manager issue its financials and timely tax returns  or are there extensionswhat are the strategies employed by each of the submanagers in the investee funds and are they sufficiently diversified to spread risk  obtain performance reports for the past  years  if the ppm gives statistical history  review this and compare to audited financials  if the manager provides historical results  ask if the results follow aimr industry association guidelinesdoes the fund report far superior results to other funds in its investment strategy group  if so ask for an explanation since there have been a number of frauds involving  purportedly excellent results that ran counter to prevailing trends  review the funds offering memorandum  if there is a form adv there will be if the  manager is a registered investment adviser compare the form adv to the ppm and to  the one on the finra websitewho are the prime brokers or other custodians for the fund  it is common for a hedge fund to have one or more prime brokers who track the  investments and custody the funds  use of a prime broker is a positive indication  however if the fund invests in commodities that part of the investing cannot be done through a prime broker  also very large funds  million and up do not use a prime broker because it is not cost effective call us first  we are experts in international hedge
