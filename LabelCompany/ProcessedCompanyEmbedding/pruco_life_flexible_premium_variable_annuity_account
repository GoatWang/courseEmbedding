have a waiting period until you can elect another lifetime withdrawal benefit see election of and designations under the program and termination of existing benefits and election of new benefits below for details the income benefit under highest daily lifetime  plus currently is based on a single designated life who is at least  years old on the date that the benefit is acquired the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is not available if you elect any other optional living benefit although you may elect any optional death benefit other than highest daily value death benefit as long as your highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is in effect you must allocate your account value in accordance with the then permitted and available investment options with this program for a more detailed description of the permitted investment options see the investment options section below and in your prospectus we offer a benefit that guarantees until the death of the single designated life the annuitant the ability to withdraw an annual amount the annual income amount equal to a percentage of an initial principal value the protected withdrawal value regardless of the impact of market performance on the account value subject to our program rules regarding the timing and amount of withdrawals you are guaranteed to be able to withdraw the annual income amount for the rest of your life lifetime withdrawals provided that you have not made excess withdrawals we also permit you to make a onetime nonlifetime withdrawal from your annuity prior to taking lifetime withdrawals under the benefit highest daily lifetime  plus may be appropriate if you intend to make periodic withdrawals from your annuity and wish to ensure that market performance will not affect your ability to receive annual payments you are not required to make withdrawals as part of the benefit  the guarantees are not lost if you withdraw less than the maximum allowable amount each year under the rules of the benefit as discussed below we require that you participate in our asset transfer program in order to participate in highest daily lifetime  plus  although you are guaranteed to withdraw your annual income amount for life even if your account value falls to zero if you take excess withdrawals it is possible that your annual income amount could also fall to zero in that scenario no further amount would be payable under the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit key feature  protected withdrawal value the protected withdrawal value is used to calculate the initial annual income amount the protected withdrawal value is separate from your account value and not available as cash or a lump sum on the effective date of the benefit the protected withdrawal value is equal to your account value on each valuation day thereafter until the date of your first lifetime withdrawal excluding any nonlifetime withdrawal discussed below the protected withdrawal value is equal to the periodic value described in the next paragraphs the periodic value initially is equal to the account value on the effective date of the benefit on each valuation day thereafter until the first lifetime withdrawal we recalculate the periodic value we stop determining the periodic value upon your first lifetime withdrawal after the effective date of the benefit on each valuation day the current valuation day the periodic value is equal to the greater of  the periodic value for the immediately preceding business day the prior valuation day appreciated at the daily equivalent of  annually during the calendar days between the prior valuation day and the current valuation day ie one day for successive valuation days but more than one calendar day for valuation days that are separated by weekends andor holidays plus the amount of any adjusted purchase payment made on the current valuation day and  the account value if you have not made a lifetime withdrawal on or before the th th or th anniversary of the effective date of the benefit your periodic value on the th th or th anniversary of the benefit effective date is equal to the greatest of  the periodic value described above or   the sum of a  on the th anniversary  on the th anniversary or  on the th anniversary of the account value on the effective date of the benefit b  on the th anniversary  on the th anniversary or  on the th anniversary of all adjusted purchase payments made within one year of the effective date of the benefit and c all adjusted purchase payments made after one year following the effective date of the benefit if you elect highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income option  bio see below we will stop determining the periodic value as described above on the earlier of your first lifetime withdrawal after the effective date of the benefit or the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the benefit anniversary date this means that under the highest daily lifetime  plus with bio benefit you will not be eligible for the guaranteed minimum periodic values described above on the th and th anniversary of the benefit effective date on and after the date of your first lifetime withdrawal your protected withdrawal value is increased by the amount of any subsequent purchase payments is reduced by withdrawals including your first lifetime withdrawal as described below and is increased if you qualify for a stepup as described below return of principal guarantee if you have not made a lifetime withdrawal before the tenth anniversary we will increase your account value on that tenth anniversary or the next valuation day if that anniversary is not a valuation day if the requirements set forth in this paragraph are met on the tenth anniversary we add a your account value on the day that you elected highest daily lifetime  plus and b the sum of each purchase payment including the amount of any associated credits you made during the oneyear period after you elected the benefit if the sum of a and b is greater than your account value on the tenth anniversary we increase your account value to equal the sum of a and b by contributing funds from our general account if the sum of a and b is less than or equal to your account value on the tenth anniversary we make no such adjustment the amount that we add to your account value under this provision will be allocated to each of your variable investment options including the ast investment grade bond subaccount in the same proportion that each such subaccount bears to your total account value immediately before the application of the amount any such  amount will not be considered a purchase payment when calculating your protected withdrawal value your death benefit or the amount of any optional benefit that you may have selected and therefore will have no direct impact on any such values at the time we add this amount because the amount is added to account value it will also be subject to each charge under your annuity based on account value this potential addition to account value is available only if you have elected highest daily lifetime  plus and if you meet the conditions set forth in this paragraph thus if you take a withdrawal other than a nonlifetime withdrawal prior to the tenth anniversary you are not eligible to receive the return of principal guarantee the return of principal guarantee is referred to as the guaranteed minimum account value credit in the benefit rider key feature  annual income amount under the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit the annual income amount is equal to a specified percentage of the protected withdrawal value the percentage initially depends on the age of the annuitant on the date of the first lifetime withdrawal after election of the benefit the percentages are  for ages   less than    for ages      for ages   for ages  and  for ages  and older under the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit if your cumulative lifetime withdrawals in an annuity year are less than or equal to the annual income amount they will not reduce your annual income amount in subsequent annuity years but any such withdrawals will reduce the annual income amount on a dollarfordollar basis in that annuity year if your cumulative lifetime withdrawals are in excess of the annual income amount excess income your annual income amount in subsequent years will be reduced except with regard to required minimum distributions for this annuity that comply with our rules by the result of the ratio of the excess income to the account value immediately prior to such withdrawal see examples of this calculation below reductions are based on the actual amount of the withdrawal including any cdsc that may apply lifetime withdrawals of any amount up to and including the annual income amount will reduce the protected withdrawal value by the amount of the withdrawal withdrawals of excess income will reduce the protected withdrawal value by the same ratio as the reduction to the annual income amount note that if your withdrawal of the annual income amount in a given annuity year exceeds the applicable free withdrawal amount under the annuity but is not considered excess income we will not impose any cdsc on the amount of that withdrawal  you may use the systematic withdrawal program to make withdrawals of the annual income amount any systematic withdrawal will be deemed a lifetime withdrawal under this benefit any purchase payment that you make subsequent to the election of highest daily lifetime  plus will i increase the thenexisting annual income amount by an amount equal to a percentage of the purchase payment including the amount of any associated credits based on the age of the annuitant at the time of the first lifetime withdrawal the percentages are  for ages   less than    for ages      for ages   for ages  and  for ages  and older and ii increase the protected withdrawal value by the amount of the purchase payment including the amount of any associated credits highest daily auto stepup an automatic stepup feature highest daily auto stepup is part of highest daily lifetime  plus as detailed in this paragraph the highest daily auto stepup feature can result in a larger annual income amount if your account value increases subsequent to your first lifetime withdrawal the highest daily auto stepup starts with the anniversary of the issue date of the annuity the annuity anniversary immediately after your first lifetime withdrawal under the benefit specifically upon the first such annuity anniversary we identify the account value on each valuation day within the immediately preceding annuity year after your first lifetime withdrawal having identified the highest daily value we then multiply each such value by a percentage that varies based on the age of the annuitant on the annuity anniversary as of which the stepup would occur the percentages are  for ages   less than    for ages      for ages   for ages  and  for ages  and older thus we multiply the highest daily value by the applicable percentage adjust each such daily value for subsequent withdrawals and purchase payments and then select the highest of those values if the highest of those values exceeds the existing annual income amount we replace the existing amount with the new higher amount otherwise we leave the existing annual income amount intact the account value on the annuity anniversary value is considered the last daily stepup value of the annuity year all daily valuations and annual stepups will only occur on a valuation day in later years ie after the first annuity anniversary after the first lifetime withdrawal we determine whether an automatic stepup should occur on each annuity anniversary by performing a similar examination of the account values that occurred on valuation days during the year at the time that we increase your annual income amount we also increase your protected withdrawal value if it is higher than your protected withdrawal value prior to the daily stepup your protected withdrawal value will never be decreased as a result of a stepup to equal the highest daily  value upon which your stepup was based if on the date that we implement a highest daily auto stepup to your annual income amount the charge for highest daily lifetime  plus has changed for new purchasers you may be subject to the new charge at the time of such stepup prior to increasing your charge for highest daily lifetime  plus upon a stepup we would notify you and give you the opportunity to cancel the automatic stepup feature if you receive notice of a proposed stepup and accompanying fee increase you should carefully evaluate whether the amount of the stepup justifies the increased fee to which you will be subject if you establish a systematic withdrawal program we will not automatically increase the withdrawal amount when there is an increase to the annual income amount unless you instruct us otherwise the highest daily lifetime  plus program does not affect your ability to make withdrawals under your annuity or limit your ability to request withdrawals that exceed the annual income amount under highest daily lifetime  plus if your cumulative withdrawals in an annuity year are less than or equal to the annual income amount they will not reduce your annual income amount in subsequent annuity years but any such withdrawals will reduce the annual income amount on a dollarfordollar basis in that annuity year if cumulatively you withdraw an amount less than the annual income amount in any annuity year you cannot carry over the unused portion of the annual income amount to subsequent annuity years because each of the protected withdrawal value and annual income amount is determined in a way that is not solely related to account value it is possible for the account value to fall to zero even though the annual income amount remains examples of dollarfordollar and proportional reductions and the highest daily auto stepup are set forth below the values shown here are purely hypothetical and do not reflect the charges for the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit or any other fees and charges assume the following for all three examples  the issue date is december    the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is elected on march    the annuitant was  years old when heshe elected the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit  example of dollarfordollar reductions on november   the protected withdrawal value is  resulting in an annual income amount of  since the annuitant is between the ages of   and  at the time of the first lifetime withdrawal the annual income amount is  of the protected withdrawal value in this case  of  assuming  is withdrawn from the annuity on this date the remaining annual income amount for that annuity year up to and including december   is  this is the result of a dollarfordollar reduction of the annual income amount  less    example of proportional reductions continuing the previous example assume an additional withdrawal of  occurs on november   and the account value at the time and immediately prior to this withdrawal is  the first  of this withdrawal reduces the annual income amount for that annuity year to  the remaining withdrawal amount of  reduces the annual income amount in future annuity years on a proportional basis based on the ratio of the excess withdrawal to the account value immediately prior to the excess withdrawal note that if there were other withdrawals in that annuity year each would result in another proportional reduction to the annual income amount here is the calculation account value before withdrawal  less amount of non excess withdrawal   account value immediately before excess withdrawal of   excess withdrawal amount   divided by account value immediately before excess withdrawal  ratio  annual income amount  less ratio of    annual income amount for future annuity years  example of highest daily auto stepup on each annuity anniversary date the annual income amount is steppedup if the appropriate percentage based on the annuitants age on the annuity anniversary of the highest daily value since your first lifetime withdrawal or last annuity anniversary in subsequent years adjusted  for withdrawals and additional purchase payments is higher than the annual income amount adjusted for excess withdrawals and additional purchase payments plus any credits continuing the same example as above the annual income amount for this annuity year is  however the excess withdrawal on november  reduces the amount to  for future years see above for the next annuity year the annual income amount will be stepped up if  since the designated life is younger than  on the date of the potential stepup of the highest daily account value adjusted for withdrawals and purchase payments including the amount of any associated credits is higher than  here are the calculations for determining the daily values only the november  value is being adjusted for excess withdrawals as the november  and december  valuation days occur after the excess withdrawal on november  highest daily value adjusted with adjusted annual income account withdrawal and purchase amount  of the date value payments highest daily value     november      november   thanksgiving day november      november      december       in this example the annuity anniversary date is december  the valuation dates are every day following the first lifetime withdrawal in subsequent annuity years valuation dates will be every day following the annuity anniversary the annuity anniversary date of december  is considered the final valuation date for the year   in this example the first daily value after the first withdrawal is  on november  results in an adjusted annual income amount of  this amount is adjusted on november  to reflect the  withdrawal the calculations for the adjustments are  the account value of  on november  is first reduced dollarfordollar by   is the remaining annual income amount for the annuity year resulting in an adjusted account value of  before the excess withdrawal  this amount  is further reduced by  this is the ratio in the above example which is the excess withdrawal divided by the account value immediately preceding the excess withdrawal resulting in a highest daily value of   the adjusted annual income amount is carried forward to the next valuation date of november  at this time we compare this amount to  of the account value on november  since the november  adjusted annual income amount of  is higher than   of  we continue to carry  forward to the next and final valuation date of december  the account value on december  is  and  of this amount is  since this is higher than  the adjusted annual income amount is reset to   in this example  of the december  value results in the highest amount of  since this amount is higher than the current years annual income amount of  adjusted for excess withdrawals the annual income amount for the next annuity year starting on december   and continuing through december   will be steppedup to  nonlifetime withdrawal feature you may take a onetime nonlifetime withdrawal nonlifetime withdrawal under highest daily lifetime  plus it is an optional feature of the benefit that you must elect at the time of your first withdrawal the amount of the nonlifetime withdrawal cannot be more than the amount that would cause the annuity to be taken below the minimum surrender value after the withdrawal for your annuity see access to account value in the prospectus this nonlifetime withdrawal will not result in the calculation of the initial annual income amount however the total amount of the withdrawal will proportionally reduce all guarantees associated with the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit you must tell us if your withdrawal is intended to be the nonlifetime withdrawal and not the first lifetime withdrawal under the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit if you dont elect the nonlifetime withdrawal the first withdrawal you make will be the first lifetime withdrawal that establishes your protected withdrawal value and annual income amount once you elect to take the nonlifetime withdrawal or lifetime withdrawals no additional nonlifetime withdrawals may be taken the nonlifetime withdrawal will proportionally reduce the protected withdrawal value the return of principal guarantee and the periodic value guarantees on the tenth twentieth and twentyfifth anniversaries of the benefit effective date described above by the percentage the total withdrawal amount including any applicable cdsc represents of the then current account value immediately prior to the withdrawal if you are participating in a systematic withdrawal program the first withdrawal under the program cannot be classified as the nonlifetime withdrawal the first partial withdrawal in payment of any third party investment advisory service from your annuity also cannot be classified as the nonlifetime withdrawal example  nonlifetime withdrawal proportional reduction this example is purely hypothetical and does not reflect the charges for the benefit or any other fees and charges it is intended to illustrate the proportional reduction of the nonlifetime withdrawal under this benefit  assume the following  the issue date is december    the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is elected on march    the account value at benefit election was   the annuitant was  years old when heshe elected the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit  no previous withdrawals have been taken under the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit on may   the protected withdrawal value is  the th

value guarantee is  and the account value is  assuming  is withdrawn from the annuity on may   all guarantees associated with the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit will be reduced by the ratio the total withdrawal amount represents of the account value just prior to the withdrawal being taken here is the calculation withdrawal amount divided by   account value before withdrawal  equals ratio  all guarantees will be reduced by the above ratio  protected withdrawal value   th benefit year return of premium   th benefit year minimum periodic value   th benefit year minimum periodic value   th benefit year minimum periodic value   required minimum distributions withdrawals that exceed the annual income amount but which you are required to take as a required minimum distribution for this annuity will not reduce the annual income amount for future years no additional annual income amounts will be available in an annuity year due to required minimum distributions unless the required minimum distribution amount is greater than the annual income amount any withdrawal you take that exceeds the annual income amount in annuity years that your required minimum distribution amount is not greater than the annual income amount will be treated as an excess withdrawal under the benefit if the required minimum distribution as calculated by us for your annuity is greater than the annual income amount an amount equal to the remaining annual income amount plus the difference between  the required minimum distribution amount and the annual income amount will be available in the current annuity year without it being considered an excess withdrawal example  required minimum distributions the following example is purely hypothetical and is intended to illustrate a scenario in which the required minimum distribution amount in a given annuity year is greater than the annual income amount annual income amount   remaining annual income amount   required minimum distribution   the amount you may withdraw in the current annuity year without it being treated as an excess withdrawal is        if the  withdrawal is taken the remaining annual income amount will be zero and the remaining required minimum distribution amount of  may be taken in the subsequent annuity year when your annual income amount is reset benefits under the highest daily lifetime  plus program  to the extent that your account value was reduced to zero as a result of cumulative withdrawals that are less than or equal to the annual income amount or as a result of the fee that we assess for highest daily lifetime  plus and amounts are still payable under highest daily lifetime  plus we will make an additional payment if any for that annuity year equal to the remaining annual income amount for the annuity year thus in that scenario the remaining annual income amount would be payable even though your account value was reduced to zero in subsequent annuity years we make payments that equal the annual income amount as described in this section we will make payments until the death of the single designated life to the extent that cumulative withdrawals in the current annuity year that reduced your account value to zero are more than the annual income amount the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit terminates and no additional payments are made however if a withdrawal in the latter scenario was taken to meet minimum distribution requirements under the annuity then the benefit will not terminate and we will continue to pay the annual income amount in the form of a fixed annuity if annuity payments are to begin under the terms of your annuity or if you decide to begin receiving annuity payments and there is an annual income amount due in subsequent annuity years you can elect one of the following two options  apply your account value to any annuity option available or   request that as of the date annuity payments are to begin we make annuity payments each year equal to the annual income amount if this option is elected the annual income amount will not increase after annuity payments have begun we will make payments until the death of the single designated life we must receive your request in a form acceptable to us at our office  in the absence of an election when mandatory annuity payments are to begin we will make annual annuity payments in the form of a single life fixed annuity with ten payments certain by applying the greater of the annuity rates then currently available or the annuity rates guaranteed in your annuity the amount that will be applied to provide such annuity payments will be the greater of  the present value of the future annual income amount payments such present value will be calculated using the greater of the single life fixed annuity rates then currently available or the single life fixed annuity rates guaranteed in your annuity and  the account value  if no lifetime withdrawal was ever taken we will calculate the annual income amount as if you made your first lifetime withdrawal on the date the annuity payments are to begin  please note that payments that we make under this benefit after the annuity anniversary coinciding with or next following the annuitants th birthday will be treated as annuity payments other important considerations  withdrawals under the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the annuity including any applicable cdsc for withdrawals that exceed the annual income amount and the nonlifetime withdrawal  withdrawals made while the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is in effect will be treated for tax purposes in the same way as any other withdrawals under the annuity  you can make withdrawals from your annuity while your account value is greater than zero without purchasing the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit provides a guarantee that if your account value declines due to market performance you will be able to receive your annual income amount in the form of periodic benefit payments  upon inception of the benefit  of your account value must be allocated to the permitted subaccounts  you cannot allocate purchase payments or transfer account value to the ast investment grade bond portfolio subaccount see description below if you elect this benefit a summary description of the ast investment grade bond portfolio appears within the prospectus section entitled what are the investment objectives and policies of the portfolios upon the initial  transfer of your account value into the ast investment grade bond portfolio we will send a prospectus for that portfolio to you along with your confirmation in addition you can find a copy of the ast investment grade bond portfolio prospectus by going to wwwprudentialannuitiescom  transfers to and from the elected subaccounts and the ast investment grade bond portfolio subaccount triggered by highest daily lifetime  plus will not count toward the maximum number of free transfers allowable under an annuity  we currently limit the subaccounts in which you may allocate account value if you participate in this benefit see investment options below and in the prospectus moreover if you are invested in prohibited investment options and seek to elect the benefit we will ask you to reallocate to permitted investment options as a prerequisite to electing the benefit  the fee for highest daily lifetime  plus is  annually of the greater of account value and the protected withdrawal value we deduct this fee at the end of each benefit quarter where each such quarter is part of a year that begins on the effective date of the benefit or an anniversary thereafter thus on each such quarterend or the next valuation day if the quarterend is not a valuation day we deduct  of the greater of the prior days account value or the prior days protected withdrawal value at the end of the quarter we deduct the fee pro rata from each of your subaccounts including the ast investment grade bond portfolio subaccount since this fee is based on the greater of the prior days account value or the prior days protected withdrawal value the fee for highest daily lifetime  plus may be greater than it would have been had it been based on the account value alone if the fee to be deducted exceeds the account value at the benefit quarter we will charge the remainder of the account value for the benefit and continue the benefit as described above election of and designations under the program for highest daily lifetime  plus there must be either a single owner who is the same as the annuitant or if the annuity is entity owned there must be a single natural person annuitant in either case the annuitant must be at least  years old any change of the annuitant under the annuity will result in cancellation of highest daily lifetime  plus similarly any change of owner will result in cancellation of highest daily lifetime  plus except if a the new owner has the same taxpayer identification number as the previous owner b ownership is transferred from a custodian to the annuitant or vice versa or c ownership is transferred from one entity to another entity  highest daily lifetime  plus can be elected at the time that you purchase your annuity or after the issue date subject to our eligibility rules and restrictions if you elect highest daily lifetime  plus and terminate it you can reelect it on any annuity anniversary and for the first  days following any annuity anniversary additionally if you currently own an annuity with a living benefit you may terminate your existing benefit rider and elect the benefits offered in this supplement as set forth under termination of existing benefits and election of new benefits below we reserve the right to waive change andor further limit the election frequency in the future these restrictions are waived if the lifetime five highest daily lifetime five highest daily lifetime seven highest daily lifetime  plus spousal lifetime five spousal highest daily lifetime seven and spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefits were terminated as a result of the death of the annuitant and the beneficiary elected to continue the annuity under the spousal assumption provision termination of the program you may terminate highest daily lifetime  plus at any time by notifying us if you terminate the benefit any guarantee provided by the benefit will terminate as of the date the termination is effective and certain restrictions on reelection will apply as described above the benefit automatically terminates i upon your termination of the benefit ii upon your surrender of the annuity iii upon your election to begin receiving annuity payments although if you have elected to receive the annual income amount in the form of annuity payments we will continue to pay the annual income amount iv upon our receipt of due proof of the death of the annuitant v if both the account value and annual income amount equal zero or vi if you cease to meet our requirements for issuing the benefit see elections and designations under the program upon termination of highest daily lifetime  plus other than upon the death of the annuitant we impose any accrued fee for the benefit ie the fee for the prorated portion of the year since the fee was last assessed and thereafter we cease deducting the charge for the benefit with regard to your investment allocations upon termination we will i leave intact amounts that are held in the variable investment options and ii transfer all amounts held in the ast investment grade bond portfolio subaccount to your variable investment options based on your existing allocation instructions or in the absence of such existing instructions pro rata ie in the same proportion as the current balances in your variable investment options if a surviving spouse elects to continue the annuity the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit terminates the spouse may elect the benefit subject to the restrictions discussed above  how highest daily lifetime  plus transfers account value between your permitted subaccounts and the ast investment grade bond subaccount as indicated above we limit the subaccounts to which you may allocate account value if you elect highest daily lifetime  plus for purposes of this benefit we refer to those permitted subaccounts as the permitted subaccounts an integral part of highest daily lifetime  plus is the predetermined mathematical formula used to transfer account value between the permitted subaccounts and a specified bond fund within the advanced series trust the ast investment grade bond subaccount the ast investment grade bond subaccount is available only with this benefit and thus you may not allocate purchase payments to the ast investment grade bond subaccount the mathematical formula monitors your account value daily and if dictated by the formula systematically transfers amounts between the permitted subaccounts you have chosen and the ast investment grade bond subaccount the formula is set forth in appendix f below speaking generally the formula which is applied each valuation day operates as follows the formula starts by identifying an income basis for that day and then multiplies that figure by  to produce a projected ie hypothetical income amount note that  is used in the formula irrespective of the annuitants attained age then it produces an estimate of the total amount targeted in our allocation model based on the projected income amount and factors set forth in the formula in the formula we refer to that value as the target value or l if you have already made a withdrawal your projected income amount and thus your target value would take into account any automatic stepup any subsequent purchase payments and any excess withdrawals next the formula subtracts from the target value the amount held within the ast investment grade bond subaccount on that day and divides that difference by the amount held within the permitted subaccounts that ratio which essentially isolates the amount of your target value that is not offset by amounts held within the ast investment grade bond subaccount is called the target ratio or r if on each of three consecutive valuation days the target ratio is greater than  but less than or equal to  we will on such third valuation day make a transfer from the permitted subaccounts in which you are invested subject to the  cap discussed below to the ast investment grade bond subaccount once a transfer is made the three consecutive valuation days begin again if however on any valuation day the target ratio is above  it will make a transfer from the permitted subaccounts subject to the  cap to the ast investment grade bond subaccount if the target ratio falls below  on any valuation day then a transfer from the ast investment grade bond subaccount to the permitted subaccounts will occur notwithstanding the above we will not execute a transfer that results in more than  of your account value being allocated to the ast investment  grade bond subaccount  cap thus on any valuation day if the formula would require a transfer that would result in more than  of the account value being allocated to the ast investment grade bond subaccount only the amount that results in exactly  of the account value being allocated to the ast investment grade bond subaccount will be transferred in addition future transfers into the ast investment grade bond subaccount will be suspended regardless of the performance of the ast investment grade bond subaccount and the permitted subaccounts until there is first a transfer out of the ast investment grade bond subaccount once a subsequent transfer occurs out of the ast investment grade subaccount the suspension will be removed and amounts may be transferred to the ast investment grade bond subaccount if dictated by the formula subject to the  cap however it is possible that due to the subsequent investment performance of your allocations in the permitted subaccounts you have selected and the amount of your account value in the ast investment grade bond subaccount your account value could be more than  invested in the ast investment grade bond subaccount as you can glean from the formula poor or flat investment performance of your account value may result in a transfer of a portion of your variable account value to the ast investment grade bond subaccount because such poor investment performance will tend to increase the target ratio because the amount allocated to the ast investment grade bond subaccount and the amount allocated to the permitted subaccounts each is a variable in the formula the investment performance of each affects whether a transfer occurs for your annuity in deciding how much to transfer we use another formula which essentially seeks to rebalance amounts held in the permitted subaccounts and the ast investment grade bond subaccount so that the target ratio meets a target which currently is equal to  once you elect highest daily lifetime  plus the values we use to compare to the target ratio will be fixed for newlyissued annuities that elect highest daily lifetime  plus and existing annuities that elect highest daily lifetime  plus in the future however we reserve the right to change such values additionally on each monthly annuity anniversary if the monthly annuity anniversary does not fall on a valuation day the next valuation day will be used following all of the above described daily calculations a transfer may be made from the ast investment grade bond subaccount to the permitted subaccounts any such transfer will be in the same proportion that each such subaccount bears to your total account value immediately before the transfer this transfer will automatically occur provided that the target ratio as described above would be less than  after the transfer the formula will not execute a transfer if the target ratio after this transfer would occur would be greater than or equal to   the amount of the transfer will be equal to the lesser of a the total value of all your account value in the ast investment grade bond subaccount or b an amount equal to  of your total account value while you are not notified when your annuity reaches a transfer trigger under the formula you will receive a confirmation statement indicating the transfer of a portion of your account value either to or from the ast investment grade bond subaccount the formula by which the transfer operates is designed primarily to mitigate the financial risks that we incur in providing the guarantee under highest daily lifetime  plus depending on the results of the calculations of the mathematical formula we may on any valuation day  not make any transfer between the permitted subaccounts and the ast investment grade bond subaccount or  if a portion of your account value was previously allocated to the ast investment grade bond subaccount transfer all or a portion of those amounts to the permitted subaccounts based on your existing allocation instructions or in the absence of such existing instructions pro rata ie in the same proportion as the current balances in your variable investment options please see above regarding allocations made pursuant to the monthly calculation or  transfer a portion which may be substantial of your account value in the permitted subaccounts prorata to the ast investment grade bond subaccount the amount and timing of transfers to and from the ast investment grade bond subaccount pursuant to the mathematical formula depends upon a number of factors unique to your annuity and is not necessarily directly correlated with the securities markets bond markets or interest rates in general including  how long you have owned highest daily lifetime  plus or spousal highest daily lifetime  plus  the performance of the permitted subaccounts you have chosen  the performance of the ast investment grade bond subaccount  the amount you have allocated to each of the permitted subaccounts you have chosen  the amount you have allocated to the ast investment grade bond subaccount  additional purchase payments if any you make to your annuity and  withdrawals if any you take from your annuity withdrawals are taken pro rata from your account value  the more of your account value allocated to the ast investment grade bond subaccount under the formula the greater the impact of the performance of that subaccount in determining whether and how much your account value is transferred back to the permitted subaccounts further it is possible under the formula that if a significant portion of your account value is allocated to the ast investment grade bond subaccount and that subaccount has good performance but the performance of your permitted subaccounts is negative that the formula might transfer your account value to the permitted subaccounts similarly the more you have allocated to the permitted subaccounts the greater the impact of the performance of those subaccounts will have on any transfer to the ast investment grade bond subaccount if you make additional purchase payments to your annuity they will be allocated according to your allocation instructions once they are allocated to your annuity they will also be subject to the mathematical formula described above and therefore may be transferred to the ast investment grade bond portfolio if dictated by the formula any account value in the ast investment grade bond subaccount will not be available to participate in the investment experience of the permitted subaccounts if there is a subsequent market recovery until it is transferred out of the ast investment grade bond subaccount additional tax considerations if you purchase an annuity as an investment vehicle for qualified investments including an ira sepira tax sheltered annuity or b or employer plan under code section a the required minimum distribution rules under the code provide that you begin receiving periodic amounts from your annuity beginning after age   for a tax sheltered annuity or a a plan for which the participant is not a greater than five  percent owner of the employer this required beginning date can generally be deferred to retirement if later roth iras are not subject to these rules during the owners lifetime the amount required under the code may exceed the annual income amount which will cause us to increase the annual income amount in any annuity year that required minimum distributions due from your annuity are greater than such amounts in addition the amount and duration of payments under the annuity payment and death benefit provisions may be adjusted so that the payments do not trigger any penalty or excise taxes due to tax considerations such as required minimum distribution provisions under the tax law please note however that any withdrawal except the nonlifetime withdrawal you take prior to the tenth anniversary even if withdrawn to satisfy required minimum distribution  rules will cause you to lose the ability to receive the return of principal guarantee and the guaranteed amount described above under key feature  protected withdrawal value as indicated withdrawals made while this benefit is in effect will be treated for tax purposes in the same way as any other withdrawals under the annuity please see the tax considerations section of the prospectus for a detailed discussion of the tax treatment of withdrawals we do not address each potential tax scenario that could arise with respect to this benefit here however we do note that if you participate in highest daily lifetime  plus through a nonqualified annuity as with all withdrawals once all purchase payments are returned under the annuity all subsequent withdrawal amounts will be taxed as ordinary income highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income optionsm we offer an optional death benefit feature under highest daily lifetime  plus the amount of which is linked to your annual income amount we refer to this optional death benefit as the beneficiary income option or bio this option is not currently available in new york you may choose highest daily lifetime  plus without also selecting the beneficiary income option death benefit you must elect the beneficiary income option death benefit at the time you elect highest daily lifetime  plus if you elect this death benefit you may not elect any other optional benefit you may elect the beneficiary income option death benefit so long as the annuitant is no older than age  at the time of election for purposes of this optional death benefit we calculate the annual income amount and protected withdrawal value in the same manner that we do under highest daily lifetime  plus itself however we will stop determining the periodic value as described above on the earlier of your first lifetime withdrawal after the effective date of the benefit or the tenth anniversary date this means that under the highest daily lifetime  plus with bio benefit you will not be eligible for the guaranteed minimum periodic values described above on the th and th anniversary of the benefit effective date if you choose the highest daily lifetime  plus with bio the maximum charge is  of the greater of account value and the protected withdrawal value pwv annually we deduct the current charge of  of the greater of the account value and the pwv at the end of each quarter where each such quarter is part of a year that begins on the effective date of the benefit or an anniversary thereafter thus on each such quarterend or the next valuation day if the quarterend is not a valuation day we deduct  of the greater of the prior days account value or the prior days protected withdrawal value at the end of the quarter we deduct the fee pro rata from each of your subaccounts including the ast investment grade bond subaccount because the fee for this benefit is based  on the greater of the prior days account value or the prior days protected withdrawal value the fee for highest daily lifetime  plus with the beneficiary income option may be greater than it would have been based on the account value alone upon a death that triggers payment of a death benefit under the annuity we identify the following amounts a the amount of the basic death benefit under the annuity b the protected withdrawal value less any credits associated with purchase payments applied within  months prior to the date of death and c the annual income amount if there were no lifetime withdrawals prior to the date of death then we calculate the protected withdrawal value for purposes of this death benefit as of the date of death and we calculate the annual income amount as if there were a withdrawal on the date of death if there were lifetime withdrawals prior to the date of death then we set the protected withdrawal value and annual income amount for purposes of this death benefit as of the date that we receive due proof of death if there is one beneficiary heshe must choose to receive either the basic death benefit in a lump sum or other permitted form of distribution or the beneficiary income option death benefit in the form of periodic payments of the annual income amount  such payments may be annual or at other intervals that we permit if there are multiple beneficiaries each beneficiary is presented with the same choice each beneficiary can choose to take hisher portion of either a the basic death benefit or b the beneficiary income option death benefit in order to receive the beneficiary income option death benefit each beneficiarys share of the death benefit proceeds must be allocated as a percentage of the total death benefit to be paid we allow a beneficiary who has opted to receive the annual income amount to designate another beneficiary who would receive any remaining payments upon the former beneficiarys death note also that the final payment exhausting the protected withdrawal value may be less than the annual income amount here is an example to illustrate how the death benefit may be paid  assume that i the basic death benefit is  the protected withdrawal value is  and the annual income amount is  ii there are two beneficiaries the first designated to receive  of the death benefit and the second designated to receive  of the death benefit iii the first beneficiary chooses to receive hisher portion of the death benefit in the form of the annual income amount and the second beneficiary chooses to receive hisher portion of the death benefit with reference to the basic death benefit  under those assumptions the first beneficiary will be paid a prorated portion of the annual income amount for  years the  year pay out period is derived from the  annual  income amount paid each year until it exhausts the entire  protected withdrawal value the prorated portion of the annual income amount equal to  annually ie the first beneficiarys  share multiplied by  is then paid each year for the  year period payment of  for  years results in total payments of  ie the first beneficiarys  share of the  protected withdrawal value the second beneficiary would receive  of the basic death benefit amount or  if you elect to terminate highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income option both highest daily lifetime  plus and that death benefit option will be terminated you may not terminate the death benefit option without terminating the entire benefit if you terminate highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income option your ability to elect other optional living benefits will be affected as indicated in the election and designations under the program section above highest daily lifetime  plus with lifetime income acceleratorsm we offer another version of highest daily lifetime  plus that we call highest daily lifetime  plus with lifetime income accelerator highest daily lifetime  plus with lia this version is only being offered in those jurisdictions where we have received regulatory approval and will be offered subsequently in other jurisdictions when we receive regulatory approval in those jurisdictions this option is not currently available in new york highest daily lifetime  plus with lia is offered as an alternative to other lifetime withdrawal options if you elect this benefit you may not elect any other optional benefit the income benefit under highest daily lifetime  plus with lia currently is based on a single designated life who is between the ages of  and  on the date that the benefit is elected highest daily lifetime  plus with lia guarantees until the death of the single designated life the ability to withdraw an amount equal to double the annual income amount which we refer to as the lia amount if you meet the conditions set forth below if you choose the highest daily lifetime  plus with lia the maximum charge is  of the greater of account value and the protected withdrawal value pwv annually we deduct the current charge of  of the greater of account value and the pwv at the end of each quarter where each such quarter is part of a year that begins on the effective date of the benefit or an anniversary thereafter thus on each such quarterend or the next valuation day if the quarterend is not a valuation day we deduct  of the greater of the prior days account value or the prior days protected withdrawal value at the end of the quarter we deduct the fee pro rata from each of your subaccounts including the ast investment grade bond subaccount since this fee is based on the  greater of the prior days account value or the prior days protected withdrawal value the fee for highest daily lifetime  plus with lia may be greater than it would have been had it been based on the account value alone if the fee to be deducted exceeds the current account value we will reduce the account value to zero and continue the benefit as described below if this benefit is being elected on an annuity held as a b plan then in addition to meeting the eligibility requirements listed below for the lia amount you must separately qualify for distributions from the b plan itself you may choose highest daily lifetime  plus without also electing lia however you may not elect lia without highest daily lifetime  plus all terms and conditions of highest daily lifetime  plus apply to this version of the benefit except as described herein currently if you elect highest daily lifetime  plus with lia and subsequently terminate the benefit you will be able to reelect highest daily lifetime  plus with lia but all conditions of the benefit described below must be met and you may be subject to a waiting period until you can elect this or another lifetime withdrawal benefit eligibility requirements for lia amount both a waiting period of  months from the benefit effective date and an elimination period of  days from the date of notification that one or both of the requirements described immediately below have been met apply before you can become eligible for the lia amount assuming the  month waiting period has been met and we have received the notification referenced in the immediately preceding sentence the lia amount would be available for withdrawal on the valuation day immediately after the th day the waiting period and the elimination period may run concurrently in addition to satisfying the waiting and elimination period at least one of the following requirements lia conditions must be met  the designated life is confined to a qualified nursing facility a qualified nursing facility is a facility operated pursuant to law or any state licensed facility providing medically necessary inpatient care which is prescribed by a licensed physician in writing and based on physical limitations which prohibit daily living in a noninstitutional setting  the designated life is unable to perform two or more basic abilities of caring for oneself or activities of daily living we define these basic abilities as i eating feeding oneself by getting food into the body from a receptacle such as a plate cup or table or by a feeding tube or intravenously ii dressing putting on and taking off all items of clothing and any necessary braces fasteners or artificial limbs  iii bathing washing oneself by sponge bath or in either a tub or shower including the task of getting into or out of the tub or shower iv toileting getting to and from the toilet getting on and off the toilet and performing associated personal hygiene v transferring moving into or out of a bed chair or wheelchair vi continence maintaining control of bowel or bladder function or when unable to maintain control of bowel or bladder function the ability to perform personal hygiene including caring for catheter or colostomy bag you must notify us when the lia conditions have been met if when we receive such notification there are more than  days remaining until the end of the waiting period described above you will not be eligible for the lia amount if there are  days or less remaining until the end of the waiting period when we receive notification that the lia conditions are met we will determine eligibility for the lia amount through our then current administrative process which may include but is not limited to documentation verifying the lia conditions andor an assessment by a third party of our choice such assessment may be in person and we will assume any costs associated with the aforementioned assessment once eligibility is determined the lia amount is equal to double the annual income amount as described above under the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit additionally we will reassess your eligibility on an annual basis although your lia benefit for the year that immediately precedes our reassessment will not be affected if it is determined that you are no longer eligible your first reassessment may occur in the same year as your initial assessment if we determine that you are no longer eligible to receive the lia amount upon the next annuity anniversary the annual income amount would replace the lia amount there is no limit on the number of times you can become eligible for the lia amount however each time would require the completion of the day elimination period notification that the designated life meets the lia conditions and determination through our then current administrative process that you are eligible for the lia amount each as described above lia amount at the first lifetime withdrawal if your first lifetime withdrawal subsequent to election of highest daily lifetime  plus with lia occurs while you are eligible for the lia amount the available lia amount is equal to double the annual income amount lia amount after the first lifetime withdrawal if you become eligible for the lia amount after you have taken your first lifetime withdrawal the available lia amount for the current and  subsequent annuity years is equal to double the then current annual income amount however the available lia amount in the current annuity year is reduced by any withdrawals that have been taken in the current annuity year cumulative withdrawals in an annuity year which are less than or equal to the lia amount when eligible for the lia amount will not reduce your lia amount in subsequent annuity years but any such withdrawals will reduce the lia amount on a dollarfordollar basis in that annuity year withdrawals in excess of the lia amount if your cumulative lifetime withdrawals in an annuity year are in excess of the lia amount when you are eligible excess withdrawal your lia amount in subsequent years will be reduced except with regard to required minimum distributions by the result of the ratio of the excess portion of the withdrawal to the account value immediately prior to the excess withdrawal reductions include the actual amount of the withdrawal including any cdsc that may apply withdrawals of any amount excluding the nonlifetime withdrawal up to and including the lia amount will reduce the protected withdrawal value by the amount of the withdrawal excess withdrawals will reduce the protected withdrawal value by the same ratio as the reduction to the lia amount any withdrawals that are less than or equal to the lia amount when eligible but in excess of the free withdrawal amount available under this annuity will not incur a cdsc withdrawals are not required however subsequent to the first lifetime withdrawal the lia amount is not increased in subsequent annuity years if you decide not to take a withdrawal in an annuity year or take withdrawals in an annuity year that in total are less than the lia amount purchase payments if you are eligible for the lia amount as described under eligibility requirements for lia amount and you make an additional purchase payment we will increase your lia amount by double the amount we add to your annual income amount step ups if your annual income amount is stepped up your lia amount will be stepped up to equal double the stepped up annual income amount guarantee payments if your account value is reduced to zero as a result of cumulative withdrawals that are equal to or less than the lia amount or as a result of the fee that we assess for highest daily lifetime  plus with lia and there is still a lia amount available we will make an additional payment for that annuity year equal to the remaining lia amount thus in that scenario the remaining lia amount would be payable even though your account value was reduced to zero in subsequent annuity years we make payments that equal the lia amount as  described in this section we will make payments until the death of the single designated life should the designated life no longer qualify for the lia amount as described under eligibility requirements for lia amount above the annual income amount would continue to be available subsequent eligibility for the lia amount would require the completion of the  day elimination period as well as meeting the lia conditions listed above under eligibility requirements for lia amount to the extent that cumulative withdrawals in the current annuity year that reduce your account value to zero are more than the lia amount except in the case of required minimum distributions highest daily lifetime  plus with lia terminates and no additional payments are made annuity options in addition to the highest daily lifetime  plus annuity options described above after the th benefit anniversary you may also request that we make annuity payments each year equal to the annual income amount in any year that you are eligible for the lia amount we make annuity payments equal to the lia amount if you would receive a greater payment by applying your account value to receive payments for life under your annuity we will pay the greater amount prior to the th benefit anniversary this option is not available we will continue to make payments until the death of the designated life if this option is elected the annual income amount and lia amount will not increase after annuity payments have begun if you elect highest daily lifetime  with lia and never meet the eligibility requirements you will not receive any additional payments based on the lia amount spousal highest daily lifetime  plussm income benefit shd plussm spousal highest daily lifetime  plus is the spousal version of highest daily lifetime  plus currently if you elect spousal highest daily lifetime  plus and subsequently terminate the benefit you may have a waiting period until you can elect another lifetime withdrawal benefit see termination of existing benefits and election new benefits for details spousal highest daily lifetime  plus must be elected based on two designated lives as described below the youngest designated life must be at least  years old and the oldest designated life must be at least  years old when the benefit is elected spousal highest daily lifetime  plus is not available if you elect any other optional benefit as long as your spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is in effect you must allocate your account value in accordance with the then permitted and available investment options with this program for a more detailed description of permitted investment options see the investment options section of the prospectus and this supplement below  we offer a benefit that guarantees until the later death of two natural persons who are each others spouses at the time of election of the benefit and at the first death of one of them the designated lives and each a designated life the ability to withdraw an annual amount the annual income amount equal to a percentage of an initial principal value the protected withdrawal value regardless of the impact of market performance on the account value subject to our program rules regarding the timing and amount of withdrawals we also permit a onetime nonlifetime withdrawal from your annuity prior to taking lifetime withdrawals under the benefit the benefit may be appropriate if you intend to make periodic withdrawals from your annuity wish to ensure that market performance will not affect your ability to receive annual payments and wish either spouse to be able to continue the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit after the death of the first spouse you are not required to make withdrawals as part of the program  the guarantees are not lost if you withdraw less than the maximum allowable amount each year under the rules of the benefit as discussed below we require that you participate in our asset transfer program in order to participate in spousal highest daily lifetime  plus although you are guaranteed to withdraw your annual income amount for life even if your account value falls to zero if you take excess withdrawals it is possible that your annual income amount could also fall to zero in that scenario no further amount would be payable under spousal highest daily lifetime  plus key feature  protected withdrawal value the protected withdrawal value is used to calculate the initial annual income amount the protected withdrawal value is separate from your account value and not available as cash or a lump sum on the effective date of the benefit the protected withdrawal value is equal to your account value on each valuation day thereafter until the date of your first lifetime withdrawal excluding any nonlifetime withdrawal discussed below the protected withdrawal value is equal to the periodic value described in the next paragraph the periodic value initially is equal to the account value on the effective date of the benefit on each valuation day thereafter until the first lifetime withdrawal we recalculate the periodic value we stop determining the periodic value upon your first lifetime withdrawal after the  effective date of the benefit on each valuation day the current valuation day the periodic value is equal to the greater of  the periodic value for the immediately preceding business day the prior valuation day appreciated at the daily equivalent of  annually during the calendar days between the prior valuation day and the current valuation day ie one day for successive valuation days but more than one calendar day for valuation days that are separated by weekends andor holidays plus the amount of any adjusted purchase payment made on the current valuation day and  the account value if you have not made a lifetime withdrawal on or before the th th or th anniversary of the effective date of the benefit your periodic value on the th th or th anniversary of the benefit effective date is equal to the greatest of  the periodic value described above or  the sum of a  on the th anniversary  on the th anniversary or  on the th anniversary of the account value on the effective date of the benefit b  on the th anniversary  on the th anniversary or  on the th anniversary of all adjusted purchase payments made within one year of the effective date of the benefit and c all adjusted purchase payments made after one year following the effective date of the benefit if you elect spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income option bio see below we will stop determining the periodic value as described above on the earlier of your first lifetime withdrawal after the effective date of the benefit or the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the benefit tenth anniversary this means that under the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with bio benefit you will not be eligible for the guaranteed minimum periodic values described above on the th and th anniversary of the benefit effective date return of principal guarantee if you have not made a lifetime withdrawal before the tenth anniversary we will increase your account value on that tenth anniversary or the next valuation day if that anniversary is not a valuation day if the requirements set forth in this paragraph are met on the tenth anniversary we add a your account value on the day that you elected spousal highest daily lifetime  plus and  b the sum of each purchase payment including the amount of any associated credits you made during the oneyear period after you elected the benefit if the sum of a and b is greater than your account value on the tenth anniversary we increase your account value to equal the sum of a and b by contributing funds from our general account if the sum of a and b is less than or equal to your account value on the tenth anniversary we make no such adjustment the amount that we add to your account value under this provision will be allocated to each of your variable investment options including than the ast investment grade bond subaccount used with this benefit in the same proportion that each such subaccount bears to your total account value immediately before the application of the amount any such amount will not be considered a purchase payment when calculating your protected withdrawal value your death benefit or the amount of any optional benefit that you may have selected and therefore will have no direct impact on any such values at the time we add this amount this potential addition to account value is available only if you have elected spousal highest daily lifetime  plus and if you meet the conditions set forth in this paragraph thus if you take a withdrawal including a required minimum distribution other than a nonlifetime withdrawal prior to the tenth anniversary you are not eligible to receive the return of principal guarantee key feature  annual income amount under the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit the annual income amount is equal to a specified percentage of the protected withdrawal value the percentage initially depends on the age of the youngest designated life on the date of the first lifetime withdrawal after election of the benefit the percentages are  for ages   less than    for ages      for ages  to   for ages  to  and  for ages  and older we use the age of the youngest designated life even if that designated life is no longer a participant under the annuity due to death or divorce under the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit if your cumulative lifetime withdrawals in an annuity year are less than or equal to the annual income amount they will not reduce your annual income amount in subsequent annuity years but any such withdrawals will reduce the annual income amount on a dollarfordollar basis in that annuity year if your cumulative lifetime withdrawals are in excess of the annual income amount for any annuity year excess income your annual income amount in subsequent years will be reduced except with regard to required minimum distributions for this annuity that comply with our rules by the result of the ratio of the excess income to the account value immediately prior to such withdrawal see examples of this  calculation below reductions are based on the actual amount of the withdrawal including any cdsc that may apply lifetime withdrawals of any amount up to and including the annual income amount will reduce the protected withdrawal value by the amount of the withdrawal withdrawals of excess income will reduce the protected withdrawal value by the same ratio as the reduction to the annual income amount you may use the systematic withdrawal program to make withdrawals of the annual income amount any systematic withdrawal will be deemed a lifetime withdrawal under this benefit any purchase payment that you make subsequent to the election of spousal highest daily lifetime  plus will i increase the thenexisting annual income amount by an amount equal to a percentage of the purchase payment including the amount of any associated credit based on the age of the younger annuitant at the time of the first lifetime withdrawal the percentages are  for ages   less than    for ages      for ages   for ages  and  for ages  and older and ii increase the protected withdrawal value by the amount of the purchase payment including the amount of any associated credit note that if your withdrawal of the annual income amount in a given annuity year exceeds the applicable free withdrawal amount under the annuity but is not considered excess income we will not impose any cdsc on the amount of that withdrawal highest daily auto stepup an automatic stepup feature highest daily auto stepup is part of this benefit as detailed in this paragraph the highest daily auto stepup feature can result in a larger annual income amount if your account value increases subsequent to your first lifetime withdrawal the highest daily stepup starting with the anniversary of the issue date of the annuity the annuity anniversary immediately after your first withdrawal under the benefit specifically upon the first such annuity anniversary we identify the account value on each valuation day within the immediately preceding annuity year after your first lifetime withdrawal having identified the highest daily value we then multiply each such value by a percentage that varies based on the age of the youngest designated life on the annuity anniversary as of which the stepup would occur the percentages are  for ages   less than    for ages      for ages   for ages  and  for ages  and older thus we multiply the highest daily value by the applicable percentage adjust each such highest daily value for subsequent withdrawals and purchase payments and then select the highest of those values if the highest of those values exceeds the existing annual income amount we replace the existing amount with  the new higher amount otherwise we leave the existing annual income amount intact in later years ie after the first annuity anniversary after the first lifetime withdrawal we determine whether an automatic stepup should occur on each annuity anniversary by performing a similar examination of the account values that occurred on valuation days during the year at the time that we increase your annual income amount we also increase your protected withdrawal value if it is higher than your protected withdrawal value prior to the daily stepup your protected withdrawal value will never be decreased as a result of a stepup to equal the highest daily value upon which your stepup was based if on the date that we implement a highest daily auto stepup to your annual income amount the charge for spousal highest daily lifetime  plus has changed for new purchasers you may be subject to the new charge at the time of such stepup prior to increasing your charge for spousal highest daily lifetime  plus upon a stepup we would notify you and give you the opportunity to cancel the automatic stepup feature if you receive notice of a proposed stepup and accompanying fee increase you should carefully evaluate whether the amount of the stepup justifies the increased fee to which you will be subject if you establish a systematic withdrawal program we will not automatically increase the withdrawal amount when there is an increase to the annual income amount unless you instruct us otherwise the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus program does not affect your ability to make withdrawals under your annuity or limit your ability to request withdrawals that exceed the annual income amount under spousal highest daily lifetime  plus if your cumulative withdrawals in an annuity year are less than or equal to the annual income amount they will not reduce your annual income amount in subsequent annuity years but any such withdrawals will reduce the annual income amount on a dollarfordollar basis in that annuity year if cumulatively you withdraw an amount less than the annual income amount in any annuity year you cannot carryover the unused portion of the annual income amount to subsequent annuity years because each of the protected withdrawal value and annual income amount is determined in a way that is not solely related to account value it is possible for the account value to fall to zero even though the annual income amount remains  examples of dollarfordollar and proportional reductions and the highest daily auto stepup are set forth below the values shown here are purely hypothetical and do not reflect the charges for the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit or any other fees and charges assume the following for all three examples  the issue date is december    the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is elected on march    the younger annuitant was  years old when heshe elected the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit example of dollarfordollar reductions on november   the protected withdrawal value is  resulting in an annual income amount of  since the youngest designated life is between the ages of   and  at the time of the first lifetime withdrawal the annual income amount is  of the protected withdrawal value in this case  of  assuming  is withdrawn from the annuity on this date the remaining annual income amount for that annuity year up to and including december   is  this is the result of a dollarfordollar reduction of the annual income amount  less    example of proportional reductions continuing the previous example assume an additional withdrawal of  occurs on november   and the account value at the time and immediately prior to this withdrawal is  the first  of this withdrawal reduces the annual income amount for that annuity year to  the remaining withdrawal amount of  reduces the annual income amount in future annuity years on a proportional basis based on the ratio of the excess withdrawal to the account value immediately prior to the excess withdrawal note that if there were other withdrawals in that annuity year each would result in another proportional reduction to the annual income amount here is the calculation account value before withdrawal  less amount of non excess withdrawal   account value immediately before excess withdrawal of   excess withdrawal amount   divided by account value immediately before excess withdrawal  ratio  annual income amount  less ratio of    annual income amount for future annuity years   example of highest daily auto stepup on each annuity anniversary date the annual income amount is steppedup if the appropriate percentage based on the youngest designated lifes age on the annuity anniversary of the highest daily value since your first lifetime withdrawal or last annuity anniversary in subsequent years adjusted for withdrawals and additional purchase payments is higher than the annual income amount adjusted for excess withdrawals and additional purchase payments including the amount of any associated credits continuing the same example as above the annual income amount for this annuity year is  however the excess withdrawal on november  reduces the amount to  for future years see above for the next annuity year the annual income amount will be stepped up if  since the youngest designated life is younger than  on the date of the potential stepup of the highest daily account value adjusted for withdrawals and purchase payments including credits is higher than  here are the calculations for determining the daily values only the november  value is being adjusted for excess withdrawals as the november  and december  valuation days occur after the excess withdrawal on november  highest daily value adjusted with adjusted annual income account withdrawal and purchase amount  of the date value payments highest daily value     november      november   thanksgiving day november      november      december       in this example the annuity anniversary date is december  the valuation dates are every day following the first lifetime withdrawal in subsequent annuity years valuation dates will be every day following the annuity anniversary the annuity anniversary date of december  is considered the final valuation date for the year   in this example the first daily value after the first withdrawal is  on november  results in an adjusted annual income amount of  this amount is adjusted on november  to reflect the  withdrawal the calculations for the adjustments are  the account value of  on november  is first reduced dollarfordollar by   is the remaining annual income amount for the annuity year resulting in an adjusted account value of  before the excess withdrawal  this amount  is further reduced by  this is the ratio in the above example which is the excess withdrawal divided by the account value immediately preceding the excess withdrawal resulting in a highest daily value of     the adjusted annual income amount is carried forward to the next valuation date of november  at this time we compare this amount to  of the account value on november  since the november  adjusted annual income amount of  is higher than   of  we continue to carry  forward to the next and final valuation date of december  the account value on december  is  and  of this amount is  since this is higher than  the adjusted annual income amount is reset to  in this example  of the december  value results in the highest amount of  since this amount is higher than the current years annual income amount of  adjusted for excess withdrawals the annual income amount for the next annuity year starting on december   and continuing through december   will be steppedup to  nonlifetime withdrawal feature you may take a onetime nonlifetime withdrawal nonlifetime withdrawal under spousal highest daily lifetime  plus it is an optional feature of the benefit that you must elect at the time of your first withdrawal the amount of the nonlifetime withdrawal cannot be more than the amount that would cause the annuity to be taken below the minimum surrender value after the withdrawal for your annuity see access to account value in the prospectus this nonlifetime withdrawal will not stop the prelifetime withdrawal calculations of the benefit described above however the total amount of the withdrawal will proportionally reduce the guarantees associated with the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit you must tell us if your withdrawal is intended to be the nonlifetime withdrawal and not the first lifetime withdrawal under the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit if you dont elect the nonlifetime withdrawal the first withdrawal you make will be the first lifetime withdrawal that establishes your protected withdrawal value and annual income amount once you elect the nonlifetime withdrawal or lifetime withdrawal no additional nonlifetime withdrawals may be taken the nonlifetime withdrawal will proportionally reduce the protected withdrawal value the return of principal guarantee and the periodic value guarantees on the tenth twentieth and twentyfifth anniversaries of the benefit effective date described above by the percentage the total withdrawal amount including any applicable cdsc represents of the then current account value immediately prior to the time of the withdrawal if you are participating in a systematic withdrawal program the first withdrawal under the program cannot be classified as the nonlifetime withdrawal the first partial withdrawal in payment of any third party investment advisory service from your annuity also cannot be classified as the nonlifetime withdrawal  example  nonlifetime withdrawal proportional reduction this example is purely hypothetical and does not reflect the charges for the benefit or any other fees and charges it is intended to illustrate the proportional reduction of the nonlifetime withdrawal under this benefit assume the following  the issue date is december    the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is elected on march    the account value at benefit election was   the annuitant was  years old when heshe elected the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit  no previous withdrawals have been taken under the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit on may   the protected withdrawal value is  the th benefit year minimum periodic value guarantee is  the th benefit year return of principal guarantee is  the th benefit year minimum periodic value guarantee is  the th benefit year minimum periodic value guarantee is  and the account value is  assuming  is withdrawn from the annuity on may   all guarantees associated with the highest daily lifetime  plus benefit will be reduced by the ratio the total withdrawal amount represents of the account value just prior to the withdrawal being taken here is the calculation withdrawal amount divided by   account value before withdrawal  equals ratio  protected withdrawal value   all guarantees will be reduced by the above ratio  th benefit year return of premium   th benefit year minimum periodic value   th benefit year minimum periodic value   th benefit year minimum periodic value   required minimum distributions withdrawals that exceed the annual income amount but which you are required to take as a required minimum distribution for this annuity will not reduce the annual income amount for  future years no additional annual income amounts will be available in an annuity year due to required minimum distributions unless the required minimum distribution amount is greater than the annual income amount any withdrawal you take that exceeds the annual income amount in annuity years that your required minimum distribution amount is not greater than the annual income amount will be treated as an excess withdrawal under the benefit if the required minimum distribution as calculated by us for your annuity is greater than the annual income amount an amount equal to the remaining annual income amount plus the difference between the required minimum distribution amount and the annual income amount will be available in the current annuity year without it being considered an excess withdrawal the following example is purely hypothetical and is intended to illustrate a scenario in which the required minimum distribution amount in a given annuity year is greater than the annual income amount annual income amount   remaining annual income amount   required minimum distribution   the amount you may withdraw in the current annuity year without it being treated as an excess withdrawal is       if the  withdrawal is taken the remaining annual income amount will be zero and the remaining required minimum distribution amount of  may be taken in the subsequent annuity year when your annual income amount is reset benefits under the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus program  to the extent that your account value was reduced to zero as a result of cumulative withdrawals that are equal to or less than the annual income amount or as a result of the fee that we assess for spousal highest daily lifetime  plus and amounts are still payable under spousal highest daily lifetime  plus we will make an additional payment if any for that annuity year equal to the remaining annual income amount for the annuity year thus in that scenario the remaining annual income amount would be payable even though your account value was reduced to zero in subsequent annuity years we make payments that equal the annual income amount as described in this section we will make payments until the death of the first of the designated lives to die and will continue to make payments until the death of the second designated life as long as the designated lives were spouses at the time of the first death to the extent that cumulative withdrawals in the current annuity year that reduced your account  value to zero are more than the annual income amount the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit terminates and no additional payments will be made however if a withdrawal in the latter scenario was taken to meet required minimum distribution requirements under the annuity the benefit will not terminate and we will continue to pay the annual income amount in the form of a fixed annuity  if annuity payments are to begin under the terms of your annuity or if you decide to begin receiving annuity payments and there is an annual income amount due in subsequent annuity years you can elect one of the following two options  apply your account value to any annuity option available or  request that as of the date annuity payments are to begin we make annuity payments each year equal to the annual income amount we will make payments until the first of the designated lives to die and will continue to make payments until the death of the second designated life as long as the designated lives were spouses at the time of the first death if due to death of a designated life or divorce prior to annuitization only a single designated life remains then annuity payments will be made as a life annuity for the lifetime of the designated life we must receive your request in a form acceptable to us at our office in the absence of an election when mandatory annuity payments are to begin we will make annual annuity payments as a joint and survivor or single as applicable life fixed annuity with ten payments certain by applying the greater of the annuity rates then currently available or the annuity rates guaranteed in your annuity the amount that will be applied to provide such annuity payments will be the greater of  the present value of the future annual income amount payments such present value will be calculated using the greater of the joint and survivor or single as applicable life fixed annuity rates then currently available or the joint and survivor or single as applicable life fixed annuity rates guaranteed in your annuity and  the account value  if no lifetime withdrawal was ever taken we will calculate the annual income amount as if you made your first lifetime withdrawal on the date the annuity payments are to begin  please note that payments that we make under this benefit after the annuity anniversary coinciding with or next following the older of the owner or annuitants th birthday will be treated as annuity payments  other important considerations  withdrawals under the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the annuity including any applicable cdsc for withdrawals that exceed the annual income amount and the nonlifetime withdrawal  withdrawals made while the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit is in effect will be treated for tax purposes in the same way as any other withdrawals under the annuity you can make withdrawals from your annuity while your account value is greater than zero without purchasing the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit provides a guarantee that if your account value declines due to market performance you will be able to receive your annual income amount in the form of periodic benefit payments  upon inception of the benefit  of your account value must be allocated to the permitted subaccounts  you cannot allocate purchase payments or transfer account value to the ast investment grade bond portfolio subaccount as described below if you elect this benefit a summary description of the ast investment grade bond portfolio appears within the prospectus section entitled what are the investment objectives and policies of the portfolios upon the initial transfer of your account value into the ast investment grade bond portfolio we will send a prospectus for that portfolio to you along with your confirmation in addition you can find a copy of the ast investment grade bond portfolio prospectus by going to wwwprudentialannuitiescom  you can make withdrawals from your annuity without purchasing the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit provides a guarantee that if your account value declines due to market performance you will be able to receive your annual income amount in the form of periodic benefit payments  transfers to and from the elected subaccounts and the ast investment grade bond portfolio subaccount triggered by the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit will not count toward the maximum number of free transfers allowable under an annuity  we currently limit the subaccounts in which you may allocate account value if you participate in this benefit see investment options below and in the prospectus moreover if you are invested in prohibited investment options and seek to elect the benefit we will ask you to reallocate to permitted investment options as a prerequisite to electing the benefit  the fee for spousal highest daily lifetime  plus is  annually of the greater of account value and the protected withdrawal value we deduct this fee at the end of each quarter where each such quarter is part of a year that begins on the effective date of the benefit or an anniversary thereafter thus on each such quarterend or the next valuation day if the quarterend is not a valuation day we deduct  of the greater of the prior days account value  or the prior days protected withdrawal value at the end of the quarter we deduct the fee pro rata from each of your subaccounts including the ast investment grade bond subaccount since this fee is based on the greater of the prior days account value and the prior days protected withdrawal value the fee for spousal highest daily lifetime  plus may be greater than it would have been had it been based on the account value alone if the fee to be deducted exceeds the account value we will reduce the account value to zero and continue the benefit as described above election of and designations under the program spousal highest daily lifetime  plus can only be elected based on two designated lives designated lives must be natural persons who are each others spouses at the time of election of the program and at the death of the first of the designated lives to die currently spousal highest daily lifetime  plus only may be elected where the owner annuitant and beneficiary designations are as follows  one annuity owner where the annuitant and the owner are the same person and the beneficiary is the owners spouse the youngest

subaccount above for information regarding this component of the benefit  additional tax considerations if you purchase an annuity as an investment vehicle for qualified investments including an ira sepira tax sheltered annuity or b or employer plan under code section a the required minimum distribution rules under the code provide that you begin receiving periodic amounts from your annuity beginning after age   for a tax sheltered annuity or a a plan for which the participant is not a greater than five  percent owner of the employer this required beginning date can generally be deferred to retirement if later roth iras are not subject to these rules during the owners lifetime the amount required under the code may exceed the annual income amount which will cause us to increase the annual income amount in any annuity year that required minimum distributions due from your annuity are greater than such amounts in addition the amount and duration of payments under the annuity payment and death benefit provisions may be adjusted so that the payments do not trigger any penalty or excise taxes due to tax considerations such as required minimum distribution provisions under the tax law please note however that any withdrawal except the nonlifetime withdrawal you take prior to the tenth anniversary even if withdrawn to satisfy required minimum distribution rules will cause you to lose the ability to receive the return of principal guarantee and the guaranteed amount described above under key feature  protected withdrawal value as indicated withdrawals made while this benefit is in effect will be treated for tax purposes in the same way as any other withdrawals under the annuity please see the tax considerations section of the prospectus for a detailed discussion of the tax treatment of withdrawals we do not address each potential tax scenario that could arise with respect to this benefit here however we do note that if you participate in spousal highest daily lifetime  plus through a nonqualified annuity as with all withdrawals once all purchase payments are returned under the annuity all subsequent withdrawal amounts will be taxed as ordinary income spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income optionsm we offer an optional death benefit feature under spousal highest daily lifetime  plus the amount of which is linked to your annual income amount under the benefit we refer to the death benefit as the beneficiary income option or bio this option is not currently available in new york as detailed below a beneficiary taking the annuitys death benefit under this feature is paid the annual income amount until the protected withdrawal value is depleted note that the final payment exhausting the protected withdrawal value may be less than the annual income amount  you may choose spousal highest daily lifetime  plus without also selecting the beneficiary income option death benefit if you elect spousal highest daily lifetime  plus without the beneficiary income option and would like to add this feature later you must terminate the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus benefit and elect the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income option if you elect the beneficiary income option death benefit you may not elect any other optional benefit you may elect the beneficiary income option death benefit so long as each designated life is no older than age  at the time of election this death benefit is not transferable in the event of a divorce nor may the benefit be split in accordance with any divorce proceedings or similar instrument of separation if you choose the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with bio the maximum charge is  of the greater of account value and the protected withdrawal value pwv annually we deduct the current charge of  of the greater of account value and the pwv at the end of each quarter where each such quarter is part of a year that begins on the effective date of the benefit or an anniversary thereafter thus on each such quarterend or the next valuation day if the quarterend is not a valuation day we deduct  of the greater of the prior days account value or the prior days protected withdrawal value at the end of the quarter we deduct the fee pro rata from each of your subaccounts including the ast investment grade bond subaccount because the fee for this benefit is based on the greater of the prior days account value or the prior days protected withdrawal value the fee for spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with the beneficiary income option may be greater than it would have been based on the account value alone for purposes of this optional death benefit we calculate the annual income amount and protected withdrawal value in the same manner that we do under spousal highest daily lifetime  plus itself however we will stop determining the periodic value as described above on the earlier of your first lifetime withdrawal after the effective date of the benefit or the tenth anniversary date this means that under the spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with bio benefit you will not be eligible for the guaranteed minimum periodic values described above on the th and th anniversary of the benefit effective date upon the first death of a designated life no amount is payable under the beneficiary income option death benefit upon the second death of a designated life we identify the following amounts a the amount of the base death benefit under the annuity b the protected withdrawal value less any credits associated with purchase payments applied within  months prior to the date of death and c the annual income amount if there were no lifetime withdrawals prior to the date of death then we calculate the protected withdrawal value for purposes of this death benefit as of the date of death and we  calculate the annual income amount as if there were a lifetime withdrawal on the date of death if there were lifetime withdrawals prior to the date of death then we set the protected withdrawal value and annual income amount for purposes of this death benefit as of the date that we receive due proof of death if there is one beneficiary heshe must choose to receive either the base death benefit in a lump sum or other permitted form of distribution or the beneficiary income option death benefit in the form of annual payment of the annual income amount  such payments may be annual or at other intervals that we permit if there are multiple beneficiaries each beneficiary is presented with the same choice thus each beneficiary can choose to take hisher portion of either a the basic death benefit or b the beneficiary income option death benefit in order to receive the beneficiary income option death benefit each beneficiarys share of the death benefit proceeds must be allocated as a percentage of the total death benefit to be paid we allow a beneficiary who has opted to receive the annual income amount to designate another beneficiary who would receive any remaining payments upon the former beneficiarys death note also that the final payment exhausting the protected withdrawal value may be less than the annual income amount here is an example to illustrate how the death benefit may be paid  assume that i the basic death benefit is  the protected withdrawal value is  and the annual income amount is  ii there are two beneficiaries the first designated to receive  of the death benefit and the second designated to receive  of the death benefit iii the first beneficiary chooses to receive hisher portion of the death benefit in the form of the annual income amount and the second beneficiary chooses to receive hisher portion of the death benefit with reference to the basic death benefit  under those assumptions the first beneficiary will be paid a prorated portion of the annual income amount for  years the  year pay out period is derived from the  annual income amount paid each year until it exhausts the entire  protected withdrawal value the prorated portion of the annual income amount equal to  ie the first beneficiarys  share multiplied by  is then paid each year for the  year period payment of  for  years results in total payments of  ie the first beneficiarys  share of the  protected withdrawal value the second beneficiary would receive  of the basic death benefit amount or   if you elect to terminate spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income option both spousal highest daily lifetime  plus and that death benefit option will be terminated you may not terminate the death benefit option without terminating the entire benefit if you terminate spousal highest daily lifetime  plus with beneficiary income option your ability to elect other optional living benefits will be affected as indicated in the termination of existing benefits and election of new benefits section below  the following is added to your prospectus termination of existing benefits and election of new benefits if you currently own an annuity with an optional living benefit you may terminate the benefit rider and elect one of the benefits described in this supplement subject to availability of the benefit at that time there may be a waiting period before you are able to reelect a new benefit we reserve the right to waive change andor further limit availability and election frequencies in the future check with your financial professional regarding the availability of reelecting a benefit and any waiting period the benefit you reelect may be more expensive than the benefit you are terminating note that once you terminate an existing benefit you lose the guarantees that you had accumulated under your existing benefit and will begin the new guarantees under the new benefit you elect based on your account value as of the date the new benefit becomes active you should carefully consider whether terminating your existing benefit and electing a new benefit is appropriate for you  we add the following information to your prospectus regarding currently available and permitted investment options

the irs has issued regulations that may impose restrictions on your ability make such an exchange the regulations are generally effective in  but there is great uncertainty about their application to contract exchanges that take place during the period following september   and before january   the gap period because of this uncertainty it is possible that an exchange that takes place during the gap period may cause you to incur taxation on the value of the contract but it is also possible that such an exchange will not have adverse tax consequences we have asked the irs to provide more guidance on this critical issue in the meantime before you request an exchange during the gap period you should consult with your tax advisor we intend to begin accepting such transfers on or about but only if we have entered into an informationsharing agreement or its functional equivalent with the applicable employer or its agent in addition in order to comply with the regulations starting on

ability to participate in a subsequent market recovery within the permitted subaccounts conversely the account value may be higher at the beginning of the recovery eg more of the account value may have been protected from decline and volatility than it otherwise would have been had the benefit not been elected  transfers do not impact any guarantees that have already been lockedin we replace the section of the prospectus entitled asset transfer component of highest daily lifetime five with the following asset transfer component of highest daily lifetime five as indicated above we limit the subaccounts to which you may allocate account value if you elect highest daily lifetime five for purposes of this benefit we refer to those permitted subaccounts as the permitted subaccounts as a requirement of participating in highest daily lifetime five we require that you participate in our specialized asset transfer program under which we may transfer account value between the permitted subaccounts and a fixed interest rate account that is part of our general account the benefit fixed rate account we determine whether to make a transfer and the amount of any transfer under a nondiscretionary formula discussed below the benefit fixed rate account is available only with this benefit and thus you may not allocate purchase payments to the benefit fixed rate account the interest rate that we pay with respect to the benefit fixed rate account is reduced by an amount that corresponds generally to the charge that we assess against your variable subaccounts for highest daily lifetime five the benefit fixed rate account is not subject to the investment company act of  or the securities act of  under the asset transfer component of highest daily lifetime five we monitor your account value daily and if necessary systematically transfer amounts between the permitted subaccounts you have chosen and the benefit fixed rate account any transfer would be made in accordance with a formula which is set forth in the schedule supplement to the endorsement for this benefit and also appears in the appendices to the prospectus speaking generally the formula which we apply each valuation day operates as follows the formula starts by identifying your protected withdrawal value for that day and then multiplies that figure by  to produce a projected ie hypothetical highest daily annual income amount then using our actuarial tables we produce an estimate of the total amount we would target in our allocation model based on the projected highest daily annual income amount each year for the rest of your life in the formula we refer to that value as the target value or l if you have already made a withdrawal your projected highest daily annual income amount and thus your target value would take into account any automatic stepup that was scheduled to occur according to the stepup formula described above next the formula subtracts from the target value the amount held within the benefit fixed rate account on that day and divides that difference by the amount held within the permitted subaccounts that ratio which essentially isolates the amount of your target value that is not offset by amounts held within the benefit fixed rate account is  called the target ratio or r if the target ratio exceeds a certain percentage currently  it means essentially that too much target value is not offset by assets within the benefit fixed rate account and therefore we will transfer an amount from your permitted subaccounts to the benefit fixed rate account conversely if the target ratio falls below a certain percentage currently  then a transfer from the benefit fixed rate account to the permitted subaccounts would occur note that the formula is calculated with reference to the highest daily annual income amount rather than with reference to the annual income amount if you elect the new asset transfer formula calculation offered in this supplement see the discussion above regarding the  cap as you can glean from the formula poor investment performance of your account value may result in a transfer of a portion of your variable account value to the benefit fixed rate account because such poor investment performance will tend to increase the target ratio moreover flat investment returns of your account value over a period of time also could result in the transfer of your account value to the benefit fixed rate account because the amount allocated to the benefit fixed rate account and the amount allocated to the permitted subaccounts each is a variable in the formula the investment performance of each affects whether a transfer occurs for your annuity in deciding how much to transfer we use another formula which essentially seeks to rebalance amounts held in the permitted subaccounts and the benefit fixed rate account so that the target ratio meets a target which currently is equal to  once you elect highest daily lifetime five the ratios we use will be fixed for newly issued annuities that elect highest daily lifetime five and existing annuities that elect highest daily lifetime five however we reserve the right to change the ratios while you are not notified when your annuity reaches a reallocation trigger you will receive a confirmation statement indicating the transfer of a portion of your account value either to or from the benefit fixed rate account the formula by which the reallocation triggers operate is designed primarily to mitigate the financial risks that we incur in providing the guarantee under highest daily lifetime five depending on the results of the calculation relative to the reallocation triggers we may on any day  not make any transfer between the permitted subaccounts and the benefit fixed rate account or  if a portion of your account value was previously allocated to the benefit fixed rate account transfer all or a portion of those amounts to the permitted subaccounts based on your existing  allocation instructions or in the absence of such existing instructions pro rata ie in the same proportion as the current balances in your variable investment options amounts taken out of the benefit fixed rate account will be withdrawn for this purpose on a lastin firstout basis an amount renewed into a new guarantee period under the benefit fixed rate account will be deemed a new investment for purposes of this lastin firstout rule or  transfer all or a portion of your account value in the permitted subaccounts prorata to the benefit fixed rate account the interest that you earn on such transferred amount will be equal to the annual rate that we have set for that day and we will credit the daily equivalent of that annual interest until the earlier of one year from the date of the transfer or the date that such amount in the benefit fixed rate account is transferred back to the permitted subaccounts if your entire account value is transferred to the benefit fixed rate account then based on the way the formula operates the formula will not transfer amounts out of the benefit fixed rate account to the permitted subaccounts and the entire account value would remain in the benefit rate fixed account if you make additional purchase payments to your annuity they will be allocated to the subaccounts according to your allocation instructions such additional purchase payments may or may not cause the formula to transfer money in or out of the benefit fixed rate account once the purchase payments are allocated to your annuity they will also be subject to the mathematical formula which may result in immediate transfers to or from the benefit fixed rate account if dictated by the formula the amount that is transferred to and from the benefit fixed rate account pursuant to the mathematical formula depends upon a number of factors unique to your annuity and is not necessarily directly correlated with the securities markets bond markets or interest rates in general including  how long you have owned highest daily lifetime five  the performance of the permitted subaccounts you have chosen  the performance of the benefit fixed rate account ie the amount of interest credited to the benefit fixed rate account  the amount you have allocated to each of the permitted subaccounts you have chosen  the amount you have allocated to the benefit fixed rate account  additional purchase payments if any you make to your annuity  withdrawals if any you take from your annuity withdrawals are taken pro rata from your account value any account value in the benefit fixed rate account will not be available to participate in the investment experience of the permitted subaccounts if there is a market recovery until it is moved out of the benefit fixed rate account  the more of your account value allocated to the benefit fixed rate account under the formula the greater the impact of the performance of the benefit fixed rate account in determining whether and how much of your account value is transferred back to the permitted subaccounts further it is possible under the formula that if a significant portion your account value is allocated to the benefit fixed rate account and that account has good performance but the performance of your permitted subaccounts is negative that the formula might transfer your account value to the permitted subaccounts thus the converse is true too the more you have allocated to the permitted subaccounts the greater the impact of the performance of those subaccounts will have on any transfer to the benefit fixed rate account we replace the sections of the prospectus entitled asset transfer component of highest daily lifetime seven and asset transfer component of spousal highest daily lifetime seven as applicable with the following asset transfer component of highest daily lifetime sevenspousal highest daily lifetime seven as indicated above we limit the subaccounts to which you may allocate account value if you elect highest daily lifetime sevenspousal highest daily lifetime seven for purposes of the benefit we refer to those permitted subaccounts as

formula we refer to that value as the target value or l if you have already made a withdrawal your projected income amount and thus your target value would take into account any automatic stepup any

 premium taxes are not reflected in these examples premium taxes may apply depending on the state where you live  discovery select variable annuity  what is the discovery select variable annuity the discovery select variable annuity is a contract between you the owner and us the insurance company pruco life insurance company pruco life we or us under our contract or agreement in exchange for your payment to us we promises to pay you a guaranteed income stream that can begin any time after the first contract anniversary maryland residents must wait until the end of the seventh contract year your annuity is in the accumulation phase until you decide to begin receiving annuity payments the date you begin receiving annuity payments is the annuity date on the annuity date your contract switches to the income phase this annuity contract benefits from tax deferral tax deferral means that you are not taxed on earnings or appreciation on the assets in your contract until you withdraw money from your contract discovery select is a variable annuity contract this means that during the accumulation phase you can allocate your assets among  variable investment options as well as  guaranteed interestrate options if you live in maryland oregon or washington both interestrate options may not be available to you if you select a variable investment option the amount of money you are able to accumulate in your contract during the accumulation phase depends upon the investment performance of the mutual fund invested in by that variable investment option because the mutual funds portfolios fluctuate in value depending upon market conditions your assets can either increase or decrease in value this is important since the amount of the annuity payments you receive during the income phase depends upon the value of your contract at the time you begin receiving payments as mentioned above discovery select also contains  guaranteed interestrate options a fixedrate option and a marketvalue adjustment option the fixedrate option offers an interest rate that is guaranteed by us for one year and will always be at least  per year the marketvalue adjustment option guarantees a stated interest rate generally higher than the fixedrate option however assets must be held for a sevenyear period this option is not available to residents of maryland oregon or washington as the

annuity payments when the income phase begins the annuitant is also the person whose life is used to determine how much and how long these payments will continue on and after the annuity date the annuitant is the owner and may not be changed the beneficiary becomes the owner when a death benefit is payable the beneficiary is the persons or entity designated to receive any death benefit if the annuitants dies during the accumulation phase you may change the beneficiary any time prior to the annuity date by making a written request to us your request becomes effective when we approve it

interestrate options a fixedrate option and a marketvalue adjustment option not available in maryland oregon or washington we set a one year guaranteed annual interest rate that is always available for the oneyear fixedrate option for the marketvalue adjustment option we set a sevenyear guaranteed interest rate when you select one of these options your payment will earn interest at the established rate for the applicable interest rate period a new interest rate period is established every time you allocate or transfer money into a fixed interestrate option you may have money allocated in more than one interest rate period at the same time this could result in your money earning interest at different rates and each interest rate period maturing at a different time if you transfer or withdraw assets or annuitize from the marketvalue adjustment option before a interest rate period is over the assets will be subject to a market value adjustment the marketvalue adjustment may increase or decrease the amount being withdrawn or transferred and may be substantial the adjustment whether up or down will never be greater  discovery select variable annuity the amount of the marketvalue adjustment is based on the difference between the  guaranteed interest rate for the amount you are withdrawing or transferring and  stated interest rate on the date of withdrawal or transfer the amount of time left in the interest rate period is also a factor you will find a detailed description of how the marketvalue adjustment is calculated on page c of this prospectus if your

feature allows you to systematically transfer either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage out of any one variable investment option or fixed rate option and into any other variable investment options you can transfer money to more than one variable investment option the investment option used for the transfers is designated as the dca account you can have these automatic transfers made from the dca account monthly quarterly semiannually or annually by allocating amounts on a regular schedule instead of allocating the total amount at one particular time you may be less susceptible to the impact of market fluctuations your initial transfer must be at least  of your dca account after that transfers will continue automatically until the entire amount in your dca account has been transferred or until you tell us to discontinue the transfers if your dca account balance drops below  the entire remaining balance of the account will be transferred on the next transfer date you can allocate subsequent purchase payments to reopen the dca account at any time your transfers will be made on the last calendar day of each transfer period you have selected provided that the new york

you are not obligated to participate or to invest according to program recommendations autorebalancing once your money has been allocated among the variable investment options the actual performance  discovery select variable annuity of mutual funds may cause your allocation to shift for example an investment option that initially holds only a small percentage of your assets could perform much better than another investment option over time this option could increase to a larger percentage of your assets than you desire you can direct us to automatically rebalance your assets to return to your original allocation by selecting the autorebalancing feature the fixed interestrate options and the dca account cannot participate in this feature your rebalancing will be done monthly quarterly semiannually or annually based on your choice the rebalancing will be done on the last calendar day of the period you have chosen provided that the new york stock exchange is open on that date if the

the last surviving annuitant if there are coannuitants dies during the accumulation phase we will upon receiving appropriate proof of death pay a death benefit to the beneficiary designated by the contractowner the death benefit feature protects the value of the contract for the beneficiary beneficiary the beneficiary is the persons or entity you name to receive any death benefit the beneficiary is named at the time the contract is issued unless you change it at a later date unless an irrevocable beneficiary has been named you can change the beneficiary at any time before the annuitant or last surviving annuitant dies calculation of the death benefit if the annuitant dies prior to age  the beneficiary will receive the greater of the following o current value of the total assets in the contract or o the highest value of the contract on any contract anniversary date this is called the stepup value between anniversary dates the stepup  discovery select variable annuity value is only increased by additional amounts invested and reduced proportionally by withdrawals or o the total of all purchase payments compounded daily at an effective annual rate of  subject to a  cap this is called the rollup value and is also reduced proportionally by withdrawals this calculation is not available to contracts that were issued in new york upon reaching age  the stepup value and rollup value are lockedin and can only be increased by additional purchase payments but will continue to be reduced proportionally by the withdrawals for this purpose an annuitant is deemed to reach age  on the contract anniversary on or following the annuitants actual th birthday here is an example of proportional reduction if an owner withdrew  of a contract valued at  and if the stepup value was  the new stepup value following the withdrawal would be  or  of what it had been prior to the withdrawal if the contractowner and annuitant are not the same the death benefit is payable only in the event of the death of a sole annuitant or last surviving annuitant not the contractowner certain terms of this death benefit are limited in oregon in addition this death benefit was enhanced in

when you purchase a contract we will allocate your purchase payment among the variable investment options and the fixed interestrate options based on the percentages you choose the percentage of your allocation to a specific investment option can range in whole percentages from  to  if you make additional purchase payments they will be allocated in the same way as your most recent purchase payment unless you tell us otherwise we will credit these purchase payments to your contract as of the end of the business day on which the payment is received our business day closes when the new york stock exchange does usually at  pm eastern time calculating contract value the value of the variable portion of your contract will go up or down depending on the investment performance of the variable investment options you choose to determine the value of your contract we use a unit of measure called an accumulation unit an accumulation unit works like a share of a mutual fund every day we determine the value of an accumulation unit for each of the variable investment options we do this by  adding up the total amount of money allocated to a specific investment option  subtracting from that amount insurance charges and any other charges such as taxes and  dividing this amount by the number of outstanding accumulation units when you make a purchase payment we credit your contract with accumulation units the number of  discovery select variable annuity accumulation units credited to your contract is determined by dividing the amount of the purchase payment allocated to an investment option by the unit price of the accumulation unit for that investment option we calculate the unit price for each investment option after the new york stock exchange closes each day and then credit your contract the value of the accumulation units can increase decrease or remain the same from day to day the accumulation unit values chart on page  gives you more detailed information about the accumulation units of the variable investment options we cannot guarantee that the value of your contract will increase or that it will not fall below the amount of your total purchase payments however we do guarantee a minimum interest rate of  a year on that portion of the contract allocated to the fixed interestrate options  what are the expenses associated with the discovery

makes a deduction for our insurance charges the insurance charges have two parts  mortality and expense risk charge  administrative expense charge  mortality and expense risk charge the mortality risk charge is for assuming the risk that the annuitants will live longer than expected based on our life expectancy tables when this happens we pay a greater number of annuity payments the expense risk charge is for assuming that the current charges will be insufficient in the future to cover the cost of administering the contract the mortality and expense risk charge is equal on an annual basis to  of the daily value of the contract invested in the variable investment options after expenses have been deducted this charge is not assessed against amounts allocated to the interestrate options if the charges under the contract are not sufficient then we will bear the loss we do however expect to profit from this charge the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased any profits made from this charge may be used by us to pay for the costs of distributing the contracts  administrative expense charge this charge is for the expenses associated with the administration of the contract the administration of the contract would include preparing and issuing the contract establishment and maintenance of contract records confirmations annual reports personnel costs legal and accounting fees filing fees and systems costs this charge is equal on an annual basis to  of the daily value of the contract invested in the variable investment option after expenses have been deducted annual contract fee during the accumulation phase if your contract assets are less than  we will deduct  per contract year this fee may differ in certain states this annual contract fee is used for

the payment of these taxes and will make a deduction from the value of the contract to pay for them some of these taxes are due when the contract is issued others are due when annuity payments begin it is our current practice not to deduct these taxes until annuity payments begin in the few states that impose a tax the current rates range up to  this amount may vary from state to state if the contract is issued in connection with an ira transfer fee you can make  free transfers every year we measure a year from the date we issue your contract contract date if you make more than  transfers

with the discovery select contract we have prepared the following information on taxes as a general discussion of the subject this discussion is based on current laws and interpretations which may change it is not intended as tax advice to any individual you should consult your own tax adviser about your own circumstances we have included in the statement of additional information more detailed discussion about taxes we believes the contract is an annuity for federal income tax purposes accordingly no tax should generally be payable by a contractowner as a result of any increase in the value of the contract rather the contractowner will be taxed when he receives money from the contract if you expect to accumulate savings over a long period of time there should be a tax advantage in purchasing an annuity rather than for example a mutual fund with a similar investment policy and the same level of expected earnings this is because the investment return of an annuity compounds without deduction for income taxes the advantage may be considerably greater if you choose monthly annuity payments after your retirement and even more so if your income and tax rate are lower at that time annuity contracts in general annuity contracts are a means of setting aside money for future needs  usually retirement congress recognized how important saving for retirement was and provided special rules in the internal revenue code code for annuities simply stated these rules provide that you will not be taxed on the earnings on the money held in your annuity contract until you take the money out this is referred to as tax deferral there are different rules as to how you are taxed depending on how you take the money out and the type of contract qualified or nonqualified see following sections you as the owner are not to be taxed on increases in the value of your contract until a distribution occurs  either as a withdrawal or as annuity payments when you make a withdrawal you are taxed on the amount of the withdrawal that is earnings for annuity payments different rules apply a portion of each annuity payment is treated as a partial return of your purchase payments and is not taxed the remaining portion of the annuity payment is treated as ordinary income how the annuity payment is divided between taxable and nontaxable portions depends upon the period over which the annuity payments are expected to be made annuity payments received after you have received all of your purchase payments are fully includible in income qualified and nonqualified contracts if you purchase the discovery select contract as an individual and not under any pension plan specially sponsored program or an individual retirement annuity your contract is referred to as a nonqualified contract if you purchase the contract under a pension plan or an individual retirement annuity your contract is referred to as a qualified contract examples of qualified plans are individual retirement accounts or annuities iras and pension and profitsharing plans which include k plans tax considerations differ depending on whether your contract is qualified or nonqualified currently the only way for a discovery select contract to be treated as a qualified contract is if it is held as an ira considerations for nonqualified contracts taxes payable by contractowners o taxes on withdrawals and surrenders until all investment income has been withdrawn withdrawals and surrenders by a contractowner before annuity payments begin are taxed as ordinary income rather than as return of purchase payments the assignment of all or part of the contract as collateral for a loan will be treated as a withdrawal also election of the interest payment option is taxed as a surrender of the contract certain transfers of a contract for less than full consideration such as a gift will trigger tax on the investment income in the contract this rule does not apply to certain transfers between spouses or incident to divorce in addition a transfer of the contract to or the designation of a beneficiary who is either  years younger than the contractowner or a grandchild of the contract owner may have generation skipping transfer tax consequences under section  of the code o taxes on annuity payments annuity payments are taxed more favorably than withdrawals and surrenders a portion of each annuity payment you receive will be treated as a partial return of your purchase payments and will not be taxed the remaining portion will be taxed as ordinary income annuity payments are divided into taxable and nontaxable portions based on the proportion of investment in the contract to the total of the expected payments annuity payments received after the annuitant recovers the full amount of his investment will be taxable if annuity payments stop due to the death of the annuitant before his investment has been fully recovered a tax deduction is allowed for the unrecovered amount  o penalty taxes on withdrawals and annuity payments any taxable amount received under an annuity contract may be subject to a  penalty tax withdrawals will be exempt from the penalty if o made on or after the contractowner reaches age  or dies o attributable to the contractowner becoming disabled as defined in internal revenue code section m o made in the form of level annuity payments paid not less frequently than annually under a lifetime annuity o allocable to investment in the contract before august   o under a qualified funding asset defined by internal revenue code section d or o under an immediate annuity contract as defined in internal revenue code section u o taxes payable by beneficiaries generally the same tax rules apply to amounts received by the beneficiary as those set forth above with respect to the contractowner the election of an annuity payment option may defer taxes otherwise payable upon the receipt of a lump sum death benefit certain minimum distribution requirements apply in the case where the owner dies see required distributions on death of owner below o withholding of tax from distributions taxable amounts distributed from annuity contracts are subject to tax withholding you may generally elect not to have tax withheld from your payments or to elect the number of withholding exemptions to be used for calculating the amount of withholding these elections must be made on the appropriate we forms absent these elections we will withhold the tax amounts required by the applicable tax regulations annuity requirements diversification the internal revenue code the code provides that the underlying investments for a variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements each of the mutual funds in which we invest on behalf of contract holders has represented that it will comply with these requirements the prospectuses of the mutual funds provided further detail about the diversification requirements investor control irs regulations do not provide guidance concerning the extent to which contractowners may direct their investment in the particular investment options without causing the contract owners instead of us to be considered the owners of the underlying assets because of this uncertainty we reserve the right to make such changes as we deem necessary to assure that the contract qualifies as an annuity for tax purposes any such changes will apply uniformly to affected contract owners and will be made with such notice to affected contractowners as is feasible under the circumstances distributions on death of owner if the contractowner dies before the entire interest in the contract is distributed the value of the contract must be distributed to the designated beneficiary as described in this section so that the contract qualifies as an annuity under the internal revenue code if the death occurs on or after the annuity date the remaining portion of the interest in the contract must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of death if the owner dies before the annuity date the entire interest in the contract must be distributed within  years after the date of death however if an annuity payment option is selected by the designated beneficiary and if annuity payments begin within  year of the owners death the value of the contract may be distributed over the beneficiarys life or a period not exceeding the beneficiarys life expectancy the owners designated beneficiary is the person to whom ownership of the contract passes by reason of death and must be a natural person if any portion of the contractowners interest is payable to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse of the owner such portion of the contract may be continued with the surviving spouse as the owner additional matter for nonqualified contracts ownership of annuities by corporations and other entities the irs requirement to aggregate certain annuities and the favorable treatment of purchase payments made before august   and the tax on nonresident aliens are discussed briefly below you should consult with a qualified tax adviser for complete information and advice on annuity contracts and particularly these subjects if they apply to you entity owners the discussion above does not apply when contracts held by or for nonnatural persons like a corporation where a contract is held by a nonnatural person other than as agent or nominee for a natural person the contract will generally not be treated as an annuity and increases in the value of the contract will be subject to tax  aggregation requirements all annuity contracts issued by the same company and affiliates to the same contractowner during any calendar year must be treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining whether an amount is subject to tax purchase payments made before august   if your contract was issued in exchange for a contract containing purchase payments made before august   favorable tax rules may apply to certain withdrawals from the contract nonresident aliens special tax withholding rules apply to nonresident aliens considerations for qualified contracts the above information describing the taxation of nonqualified contracts does not apply to qualified contracts the different rules that govern qualified contracts are discussed below and more detailed discussion appears in the statement of additional information ira free look if you buy a contract for use as an ira we will provide you a copy of the prospectus contract and a brochure containing information about eligibility contribution limits tax particulars and other ira information in addition to this information some of which is summarized below the irs requires that you have a free look after making an initial contribution to the contract during this time you can cancel the contract by notifying us in writing and we will refund your full purchase payment under the contract or the amount your contract is worth as of the day we receive this cancellation notice this amount may be more or less than your original payment contributions limitsrollovers because of the way the contract is designed you may only purchase a contract for an ira in connection with a rollover of amounts from a qualified retirement plan you must make a minimum initial payment of  to purchase a contract this minimum is greater than the maximum amount of any annual contribution you may make to an ira which is generally year the rollover rules under the code are fairly technical however an individual or his or her surviving spouse may generally roll over certain distributions from tax favored retirement plans if he or she meets the requirements for distribution this can either be done directly or within  days from the date of these distributions these plans include section a pension or profitsharing plans like a section k plan tdas and iras once you buy the contract you can make regular ira contributions under the contract to the extent permitted by law however if you make such regular ira contributions you should note that you will not be able to treat the contract as a conduit ira which means that you will not be able subsequently to roll over the contract funds into another section a plan or tda although you may be able to transfer the funds to another ira required provisions contracts that are iras or endorsements that are part of the contract must contain certain provisions o you as owner of the contract must be the annuitant under the contract except in certain cases involving the division of property under a decree of divorce o your rights as owner are nonforfeitable o you cannot sell assign or pledge the contract other than to we o the annual premium you pay cannot be greater than  which does not include any rollover amounts o the date on which annuity payments must begin cannot be later than april st of the calendar year after the calendar year you turn age  and o death and annuity payments must meet minimum distribution requirements described below usually the full amount of any distribution from an ira including a distribution from this contract which is not a rollover is taxable as taxable income these distributions are subject to the general tax withholding rules described earlier in addition to this normal tax liability you may also be liable for the following depending on your actions o a  early distribution penalty described below o liability for prohibited transactions if you for example borrow against the value of an ira or o failure to take a minimum distribution described below roth iras congress amended the code in  to add a new section a creating the roth ira as a new type of individual retirement plan like standard iras income within a roth ira accumulates taxfree and contributions are subject to specific limits roth iras are different in the following ways o contributions to a roth ira cannot be deducted from your gross income  o qualified distributions generally held for  years and payable on account of death disability attainment of age   or first timehome buyer from roth iras are excludable from your gross income and o if eligible you may make contributions to a roth ira after attaining age   and distributions are not required to begin upon attaining such age or at any time thereafter because the contracts minimum initial payment of  is greater than the maximum annual contribution permitted to be made to a roth ira generally  less any contributions to a traditional ira you may purchase a contract as a roth ira only in connection with a rollover or conversion of the proceeds of another traditional ira conduit ira sep simpleira or roth ira the code permits persons who meet certain income limitations generally adjusted gross income under  and who receive certain qualifying distributions from such nonroth iras to directly rollover or make within  days a rollover of all or any part of the amount of such distribution to a roth ira which they establish this conversion triggers current taxation but is not subject to a  early distribution penalty once the contract has been purchased regular roth ira contributions will be accepted to the extent permitted by law minimum distribution option if you hold the contract under an ira or other tax favored plan you can satisfy the irs minimum distribution requirements described above generally distribution after age   under the contract without either annuitizing or cash surrendering a portion of the contract you as owner of the contract can select either a calculation or recalculation method to determine the minimum distribution we will send you a check for the minimum distribution amount less any other partial withdrawals that you made during the year more information on the mechanics of this calculation is available on request penalty for early withdrawals you may owe a  penalty tax to the taxable part of distributions received from an ira sep simpleira which may increase to  roth ira tda or qualified retirement plan before you attain age   there are only limited exceptions to this tax and you should consult your tax adviser for further details withholding the code requires a mandatory  federal income tax withholding for certain distributions from a qualified retirement plan unless the distribution is an eligible rollover contribution that is directly rolled into another qualified plan ira including the ira variations described above for all other distributions unless you elect otherwise we will withhold federal income tax from the taxable portion of such distribution at an appropriate percentage the rate of withholding on annuity payments where no mandatory withholding is required is determined on the basis of the withholding certificate that you file with we if you do not file a certificate we will automatically withhold federal taxes on the following basis o for any annuity payments not subject to mandatory withholding you will have taxes withheld by us as if you are a married individual with  exemptions and o for all other distributions you will be withheld at a  rate we will provide you with forms and instructions concerning the right to elect that no amount be withheld from payments in the ordinary course however you should know that in any event you are liable for payment of federal income taxes on the taxable portion of the distributions and you should consult with your tax advisor to find out more information on your potential liability if you fail

daily equivalent of the  annual charge for administrative expenses and mortality and expense risks see charges fees and deductions in the prospectus the value of the assets of a subaccount is

intent to hold the investments for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value and  the financial condition of and nearterm prospects of the issuer there are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is other than temporary these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  the risk that our assessment of an issuers ability to meet its obligations could change  the risk that the economic outlook could be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated  the risk that we are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and  the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances including those not related to the issuer could lead us to change our intent to hold the security to maturity or until it recovers in value any of these situations could result

december    and  respectively statutory surplus of the company amounted to  million and  million at december   and  respectively the statutory losses in  and  were primarily attributed to the surplus

can pay to stockholders without approval of the arizona department of insurance the maximum dividend which may be paid in any twelvemonth period without notification or approval is limited to the lesser of  of statutory surplus as of december  of the preceding year or the net gain from operations of the preceding calendar year cash dividends may only be paid out of surplus derived from

value of financial instruments the fair values presented below have been determined by using available market information and by applying valuation methodologies considerable judgment is applied in interpreting data to develop the estimates of fair value these fair values may not be realized in a current market exchange the use of different market assumptions andor estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the fair values the methods and assumptions discussed below were used in calculating the fair values of the instruments see note  for a discussion of derivative instruments fixed maturities the fair values of public fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services however for investments in private placement fixed maturity securities this information is not available for these private investments the fair value is determined typically by using a discounted cash flow model which considers current market credit spreads for publicly traded issues with similar terms by companies of comparable credit quality and an additional spread component for the reduced liquidity associated with private placements this additional spread component is determined based on surveys of various third party financial institutions historically changes in estimated future cash flows or the assessment of an issuers credit quality have been the more significant factors in determining fair values policy loans the fair value of policy loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow model based upon current us treasury rates and historical loan repayment patterns investment contracts for guaranteed investment contracts income annuities and other similar contracts without life contingencies fair values are derived using discounted projected cash flows based on interest rates being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those of the contracts being valued for individual deferred annuities

mismatches between assets and liabilities futures move substantially in value as interest rates change and can be used to either modify or hedge existing interest rate risk this strategy protects
