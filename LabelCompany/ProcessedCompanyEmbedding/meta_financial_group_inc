taxexempt municipal bonds card fee income increased  million or  for the  fiscal first quarter when compared to the same quarter in  continuing growth seen in the prior year this increase was primarily driven by prepaid deposit growth and current promotional programs from one of our largest business partners the companys fiscal  first quarter average assets grew to  billion compared to  billion in the  first quarter an increase of  the companys average cash balance during the fiscal  first quarter was  million and the end of period cash balance was  million at december    the company held much higher than typical historical cash balances in the quarter as it prepared tested and began building wholesale funding sources for taxrelated lending in the companys  second quarter also contributing to the higher cash balances was the companys decision to forgo its typical dollar cost averaging investment purchases in anticipation of the companys funding of tax related lending and the student loan portfolio that was purchased on december   total loans receivable net of allowance for loan losses increased  million or  at december   compared to december    this increase is

portfolio total loans receivable net of allowance for loan losses at december   were up  million or  compared to december   nonperforming assets npas were  of total assets at december   compared to  at december   this decrease was primarily due to a partial chargeoff related to a large nonperforming agricultural relationship in the fiscal  third quarter which does not have any remaining loan balance we are excited that we closed two separate fintech acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal  said chairman and ceo j tyler haahr in early november we acquired eps financial and have already seen positive effects from this transaction then in middecember we closed the acquisition with scs we welcome eps president clark gill and the entire eps team along with scs ceo brent turner and the scs team to the meta family we believe that these transactions solidify meta as a leader in the tax payments industry much to our satisfaction we didnt stop with the eps and scs acquisitions during the quarter as we entered into agreements with both hr block and jackson hewitt meta will provide underwriting services servicing and funding for interestfree refund advance loans for hr block customers throughout the  tax season our agreement with jackson hewitt includes underwriting servicing and originating express refund advances to jackson hewitt customers during the upcoming tax season our collective tax businesses will see a significantly increased expense burden in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year  with approximately  to  of taxrelated income expected to come in during the second quarter the levels of income and expenses during the first quarter of fiscal  were in line with our expectations while it is too early in the tax season to accurately predict volume levels we believe that our infrastructure and funding capacity is well prepared for the upcoming peak period meta is excited about these business developments and we are looking forward to continuing metas success into  and beyond financial summary revenue total revenue for the fiscal  first quarter was  million compared to  million for the same quarter in  an increase of  million or  primarily due to growth in card fee income income from taxexempt securities included in other investment securities and interest from loans which was partially offset as expected by delayed securities purchases

company recorded net income of  million or  per diluted share for the three months ended december   compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share for the three months ended december   the  fiscal first quarter pretax results included  million in amortization of intangibles  million in securities losses  million in noncash stockrelated compensation associated with employee agreements for three executive officers  million in direct tax season startup expenses and  million of acquisitionrelated expensesnet interest income was  million in the  fiscal first quarter an increase of  million or  compared to the first quarter of   the increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in the loan portfolio and higher volume and yields attained from investments primarily in high credit quality taxexempt municipal bondscard fee income increased  million or  for the  fiscal first quarter when compared to the same quarter in  continuing growth seen in the prior year this increase was primarily driven by prepaid deposit growth and current promotional programs from one of our largest business partnersthe companys fiscal  first quarter average assets grew to  billion compared to  billion in the  first quarter an increase of the companys average cash balance during the fiscal  first quarter was  million and the end of period cash balance was  million at december    the company held much higher than typical historical cash balances in the quarter as it prepared tested and began building wholesale funding sources for taxrelated lending in the companys  second quarter also contributing to the higher cash balances was the companys decision to forgo its typical dollar cost averaging investment purchases in anticipation of the companys funding of tax related lending and the student loan portfolio that was purchased on december  total loans receivable net of allowance for loan losses increased  million or  at december   compared to december    this increase is primarily related to growth in consumer loans of  million of which  million is attributable to the previously mentioned student loan portfolio purchase and commercial real estate loans of  million premium finance loans at december   were up  million or  compared to december   retail bank loans at december   were up  million or  compared to december   excluding the purchased student loan portfolio total loans receivable net of allowance for loan losses at december   were up  million or  compared to december  nonperforming assets “npas” were  of total assets at december   compared to  at december   this decrease was primarily due to a partial chargeoff related to a large nonperforming agricultural relationship in the fiscal  third quarter which does not have any remaining loan balance we are excited that we closed two separate fintech acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal  said chairman and ceo j tyler haahr in early november we acquired eps financial and have already seen positive effects from this transaction then in middecember we closed the acquisition with scs we welcome eps president clark gill and the entire eps team along with scs ceo brent turner and the scs team to the meta family we believe that these transactions solidify meta as a leader in the tax payments industry much to our satisfaction we didnt stop with the eps and scs acquisitions during the quarter as we entered into agreements with both hr block and jackson hewitt meta will provide underwriting services servicing and funding for interestfree refund advance loans for hr block customers throughout the  tax season our agreement with jackson hewitt includes underwriting servicing and originating express refund advances to jackson hewitt customers during the upcoming tax season our collective tax businesses will see a significantly increased expense burden in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year  with approximately  to  of taxrelated income expected to come in during the second quarter the levels of income and expenses during the first quarter of fiscal  were in line with our expectations while it is too early in the tax season to accurately predict volume levels we believe that our infrastructure and funding capacity is well prepared for the upcoming peak period meta is excited about these business developments and we are looking forward to continuing metas success into  and beyond” financial summary revenue total revenue for the fiscal  first quarter was  million compared to  million for the same quarter in  an increase of  million or  primarily due to growth in card fee income income from taxexempt securities included in other investment securities and interest from loans which was partially offset as expected by delayed securities purchases and higher cash balances net income           the company recorded net income of  million or  per diluted share for the three months ended december   compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share for the three months ended december   the decrease in net income was due to an increase of  million in noninterest expense partially offset by increases of  million in net interest income and  million in noninterest income the  fiscal first quarter pretax results included  million of amortization of intangibles and  million of acquisition related expenses in preparation for the upcoming tax season  first quarter pretax results also included  million in securities losses and  million in direct tax season startup expenses which consisted primarily of legal and wholesale deposit interest expense in addition pretax results included  million in named executive officer neo noncash stock related compensation associated with stock awards granted in connection with the companys three highest paid executives signing longterm employment agreements to solidify their long term commitment to the company these stock awards vest over eight years we expect noncash stock related compensation associated with these agreements to be  million in fiscal year  and  million in fiscal year  the  fiscal first quarter results highlight the increased seasonality of the companys revenue due to the addition of the aforementioned taxrelated acquisitions and agreements our tax divisions are expected to continue to generate the vast majority of their revenues in the companys fiscal second quarter with some additional revenues in the third quarter while most expenses are spread throughout the year with some additional elevated expenses in the december and march quarters net interest income net interest income for the fiscal  first quarter was  million up  million or  from the same quarter in  primarily due to increases in volume and rate in tax exempt and asset backed investments and continued sizable loan growth funded by noninterest bearing prepaid deposit growth  additionally the overall increase was driven by a better mix and higher percentage of loans and higher yielding investments primarily in high credit quality taxexempt municipal bonds  while the company carried a higher than typical cash balance due to testing and implementation of new funding programs to support the interestfree refund advance loans overall net interest income was not materially affected as the funding costs were similar to the rate earned on excess cash balances however due to the student loan portfolio purchase and taxrelated lending the company deferred significant securities purchases that would have historically taken place in the august to december months as a result of the deferral of securities purchases net interest income was negatively affected as compared to the comparable prior fiscal year period given the significant recent increase in interest rates we expect these deferred purchases which the company anticipates will take place in february and march will have significantly higher yields providing a strong positive effect on earnings going forward net interest margin net interest margin nim decreased from  in the fiscal  first quarter to  in the  first quarter excluding the subordinated debt issuance in  nim would have been  basis points higher for the quarter as mentioned above nim during the  first quarter was adversely impacted as the company carried a higher than typical cash balance due to testing and implementation of new funding programs to support the interestfree tax refund advance lending program  removing the excess cash and its corresponding funding cost the company estimates nim would have been an additional approximate  basis points higher while the subordinated debt issuance in  increased the cost of funds at the company level metabanks cost of funds remained at levels much lower than the overall company cost of funds though somewhat higher than historical levels due to preparation for the new tax season funding programs  the overall tax equivalent yield “tey” on average earning asset yields decreased by  basis points when comparing the fiscal  first quarter to the  first quarter primarily due to the aforementioned higher cash balance  adjusting for a more normalized cash balance the company estimates the tey earning asset yield would have been between  to  basis points higher we believe that the companys expanded portfolio of floating rate assets provides a runway for higher nim levels should shortterm interest rates continue to rise the company also seeks to remain diligent and disciplined when evaluating loan pool deal flow to continue to optimize the deployment of our national noninterest bearing deposit base we anticipate that many of these loan pools could add immediate earnings accretion with acceptable risk parameters as we believe to be the case with the recent student loan portfolio purchase in that respect while the addition of the student loan portfolio did not materially affect nim or the tey on average earning assets in the current quarter as the portfolio purchase was completed near the end of the quarter the impact should be positive going forward the fiscal  first quarter tey on the securities portfolio increased by two basis points compared to the comparable prior year fiscal quarter primarily due to a shifting mix in the investment portfolio with new investments in overall higher yielding investment securities rather than mortgagebacked securities mbs  we also expect margins to increase in  with slower premium amortization on the mbs portfolio due to recent higher rates the company’s average interestearning assets for the fiscal  first quarter grew by  million or  to  billion from the same quarter in  primarily from growth in tax exempt investment securities loan portfolios and cash and fed funds sold of  million  million and  million respectively  overall the cost of funds for all deposits and borrowings averaged  during the fiscal  first quarter compared to  for the  first quarter primarily due to the issuance of the companys subordinated debt in  and the testing and implementation of additional funding programs throughout the quarter notwithstanding this increase the company believes that its growing lowcost deposit base gives it a distinct and significant competitive advantage over most banks and even more so if interest rates rise because the company anticipates that its cost of funds will likely remain relatively low increasing less than at many other banks average earning assets for the three months ended december   increased  from the comparable prior year period while interestbearing liabilities increased by  related to the wholesale deposits described above the tey of mbs and other investments was  for the three months ended december   and  for the same period in  and is expected to increase further early in  because of the recent increase in rates noninterest income fiscal  first quarter noninterest income of  million increased  million or  from  million in the same quarter of  primarily due to an increase in card fee income of  million or  mainly from new and existing business partners and sales promotions from one of our largest business partners this increase was partially offset by a loss on the sale of securities of  million noninterest expense noninterest expense increased  million or  to  million for the  fiscal first quarter compared to the same quarter in   between these quarters compensation expense increased  million legal and consulting expense increased  million due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and loan funding transactions other expense increased  million occupancy and equipment expense increased  million and amortization expense increased  million primarily due to the recent acquisitions the increase in compensation was primarily due to the eps and scs acquisitions noncash stock related compensation associated with three neos signing longterm employment agreements and additional staffing to support the company’s growth initiatives we expect the growth rate in compensation expense to decrease during the remainder of  as staffing levels grow more modestly income tax expense for the fiscal  first quarter was  million or an effective tax rate of  compared to a tax benefit of  million or an effective tax rate of  for the  first quarter the increase in the effective tax rate is mainly due to increased annual projected taxable earnings for the fiscal  year and the effective tax rate is expected to stay approximately at that level for the remainder of fiscal  loans total loans receivable net of allowance for loan losses increased  million or  from december   to december    among lending categories this included a  million increase in consumer  million of which was due to the student loan portfolio purchase and a  million increase or  in commercial real estate partially offset by a  million decrease or  in total agricultural loans premium finance loans increased  million or  from december   to december   retail bank loans increased  million or  from december   to december   excluding the purchased student loan portfolio total loans receivable net of allowance for loan losses were up  million or  from december   to december   the company recorded a provision for loan losses of  million during the three months ended december   primarily related to loan growth the company’s allowance for loan losses was  million or  of total loans at december   compared to an allowance of  million or  of total loans at september    credit quality metabank’s npas at december   were  million representing  of total assets compared to  million and  of total assets at december   and  million and  at september   consistent with december   and september   the payments segment did not include any npas at december   investments total investment securities and mbs increased by  million or  to  billion at december   as compared to december   this included an increase in investment securities of  million primarily from purchases of high credit quality nonbank qualified “nbq” municipal securities and governmentrelated assetbacked securities and an increase in mbs of  million as purchases exceeded sales and pay downs  average tey on the securities portfolio increased two basis points in the first quarter of fiscal  from the same quarter of   overall tey yields increased by five basis points on nonmbs investment securities over that same time period  yields decreased within mbs by  basis points in the first quarter of  from the same quarter of  due to the significant downward movement in longer term interest rates in late fiscal  and the time it takes for rate increases late in the calendar year to funnel through the mortgage and refinancing market the company anticipates prepayments on its mbs holdings to decrease meaningfully by no later than march  due to the recent increase in longer term rates thereby slowing premium amortization and increasing yields and income realized from the mbs portfolio for example the company estimates based on projections provided by the yield book software in concert with management assumptions on its fixed rate mbs portfolio as of december   in the base yield book lifetime projected speeds at current rates and in a  and  immediate parallel shocked interest rate environment interest earned on its fixed rate mbs securities and reinvested principal at market rates over one year’s time would increase by  million  million and  million respectively from the current historical threemonth cpr income amount mbs duration extension is also muted with extension expectations near  years in a  immediate parallel interest rate shocked environment the focus of the mbs portfolio remains on minimizing prepayment speed volatility by selecting agency mbs with characteristics intended to make the company’s agency mbs holdings less susceptible to increased prepayment speeds while still allowing yields to increase if interest rates increase with controlled extension risk the company continues to purchase highquality investments within certain sectors of the municipal market at what it believes to be attractive yields many of these new purchases are taxexempt and also backed or collateralized by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac thereby enhancing credit quality the company also has opportunistically and carefully selected certain government related and guaranteed floating rate securities at yields that are expected to enhance the portfolios projected performance in a rising interest rate environment the company continues to execute its investment strategy of primarily purchasing us governmentrelated securities and us governmentrelated mbs as well as aaa and aa rated nbq municipal bonds however the company is also reviewing opportunities to add other diverse highquality securities at attractive relative rates when opportunities arise  with the company’s large percentage of noninterest bearing deposits the tey for these nbq bonds is higher than a similar term investment in other investment categories of similar risk and higher than many other banks can realize on the same instruments due to the company’s current cost of funds and its projected cost of funds if interest rates rise deposits and other liabilities total endofperiod deposits increased  billion or  to  billion at december   compared to september   the increase in endofperiod deposits is primarily a result of wholesale deposits executed by the company during the fiscal  first quarter to prepare for the upcoming tax season and the student loan portfolio purchase total wholesale deposits at december   were  million total average deposits for the fiscal  first quarter increased by  million or  compared to the same period in  a portion of the growth is directly related to the testing and implementation of new funding programs to support the interestfree refund advance loans average noninterest bearing deposits for the  first quarter were up  million or  compared to the same period in  the company experienced some volatility in the growth rate of its meta payment systems mpsrelated noninterest bearing deposits as a onetime program expires and the timing of new programs begins to accelerate though longterm growth rates are expected to remain strong  the average balance of total deposits and interestbearing liabilities was  billion for the threemonth period ended december   compared to  billion for the same period in fiscal  a portion of this increase was due to the previously mentioned testing and implementation of new funding programs as well as the companys completion of the public offering of its subordinated notes in august  which are due august   business segment performance payments for the fiscal  first quarter payments recorded income before tax of  million compared to  million during the same period last year as expected our combined tax businesses refund advantage eps and scs incurred a pretax loss of  million during the quarter

banking segment recorded income before tax of  million for the first quarter of fiscal  compared to  million in the first quarter of  this increase is primarily driven by the increase in interest
