sustainabilityproducts we view fashion as a merging of art innovation and sustainability after all levi’s® jeans are what the next generation wears — and we take that role to heart we like to say that our company and our products are made of progress in part because we have a long history of firsts of leading of innovating of making a difference innovation is embedded throughout our clothing from our rivet patent in  to the more recent development of the waterless™ wasteless™ and wellthread collections water‹less™water‹less™ our lifecycle studies illustrate how essential water is to our business we’re extremely dependent on it every step of the process to create a garment requires water from the cotton fields to manufacturing facilities in an era of increasing water scarcity we recognize that water is an essential raw material for agriculture and many industries besides apparel we must decouple the growth of our business and our water needs if we want to continue leading into the future the waterless™ process approaches the decisions made in the design process in a different way reducing the amount of water used in the finishing process it’s not rocket science but it is innovative for instance by simply removing water from stone washes or combining multiple wet cycle processes we can significantly reduce water usage — up to  percent for some styles at the same time we still deliver the same great look and feel that you know and love since launching the waterless™ process in  we have saved more than  billion liters of water in the manufacturing of lsco products including  million liters of fresh water saved through reuse and recycling by  the levi’s brand aims to make  percent of its products using waterless™ techniques up from nearly  percent today shop waterless™levi’s® wellthread™ collectionrecognizing that true innovation is best achieved by rethinking the entire apparel making process we are breaking down the silos of design sourcing and production to develop more sustainable practices our collaborative approach to sustainable design has produced a number of important breakthroughs for our enduring brands our latest levi’s® wellthread™ collection represents a fundamental reinvention of the design process to incorporate sustainability into every stage of the development process the end results are durable products with timeless enduring style that are more responsible for both the people who wear them and the planet the levi’s® wellthread™ collection is the first ever to feature levi’s® waterless™ fabric which saves more than  percent of the water in the dye process than conventional dyeing for this collection waterless™ finishes use up to  percent less water than traditional finishing also integral to the wellthread approach is the creation of products from a single fibercotton made of  cotton the fabric thread pocketing and labels are all designed for recyclability with a future state of closed loop recycling in mind the collection is produced in factories where we’re implementing a new approach to improving the lives of apparel workers from haiti to sri lanka levi’s® wellthread™ garments were made at facilities that invest in the wellbeing of the people who crafted the garments examples include programs that help promote financial literacy and women’s health and family wellness shop the levis® wellthread™ collectionwaste‹less™levi’s® waste‹less™ collection water is just one example of the resource constraints we are facing across the planet looking into the future there’s no guarantee that there will enough land available to meet global demand for cotton the main input for our apparel so to be a successful company in a world that is increasingly resourceconstrained we need to continue down the road toward achieving closedloop apparel — while incorporating other alternatives to virgin raw materials this is why we launched the levi’s® wasteless™ collection of products that are made of  percent postconsumer waste specifically recycled plastic bottles that works out to an average of three to eight plastic bottles per pair to date since the collection launched in spring  we’ve used  million recycled bottles for products such as levi’s® ™ skinny jeans levi’s® trucker jackets and the women’s levi’s® boyfriend skinny jeans product suppliers  levi strauss sustainabilityproduction product suppliers our featured suppliers for more than  years levi strauss  co has worked to honor the pioneering spirit of hard work individuality and authenticity in how we make our products and how we run our company we’ve dedicated ourselves to elevating the dignity of the people who work to bring our clothing to market and we’ve invested our time energy heart and resources in improving the future of these communities in october  we were the first apparel company to release the names and locations of all our active approved ownedandoperated contract and licensee factories that manufacture and finish levi’s® dockers® and signature by levi strauss™ products we believe that making our factory list public fosters collaboration with other brands and leads to sectorwide improvement on supplier performance on improving workplace conditions view full supplier listbetter work program we actively support the international labor organization’s better work program to improve working conditions in apparel factories better work brings local enterprises international buyers governments and ngos together to build partnerships and create a rigorous cycle of improvement improving worker conditions in  we were the first multinational apparel company to establish a comprehensive workplace code of conduct known as our terms of engagement for our manufacturing suppliers our sustainability guidebook spells out in detail these labor health and safety and environmental requirements it is based on united nations documents such as the universal declaration of human rights and international labor organization ilo core conventions over the years many companies have adopted similar codes of conduct and today most of those reflect our original terms of engagement in  we added strict water quality standards as part of our environmental requirements between  and  we strengthened protections of workers’ rights to form unions and conduct collective bargaining and in  we included new guidelines regarding migrant workers fire safety and building integrity factory assessments over the years we have established a strong program to assess how well our suppliers are meeting our code and when we identify problems how to remedy we have also learned that monitoring our suppliers is only one part of improving working conditions in addition to working directly with our suppliers we have programs in their communities to strengthen worker rights we also work with governments to strengthen labor laws and their enforcement ultimately improving working conditions in our supplier factories requires the involvement of our suppliers local organizations governments and other buyers that may be sourcing in those factories we employ fulltime headcount in select geographical areas located around the world where our suppliers are they are responsible to manage our external monitor qualification program as well as local partnerships like the international labor organization’s better work program these external monitors understand the scope of our labor and environment health and safety standards and know the local languages laws culture and business context of each country in which we operate they conduct regular assessments in cycles of  to  months of every factory contracted to manufacture our products these assessments are based on standards found in our sustainability guidebook assessments involve onsite and offsite discussions with workers using specific guidelines developed by ask called gathering information from workers management interviews review of factory records such as timecards and payroll and environment health and safety inspections each assessment identifies areas for improvement and a detailed corrective action plan including actions responsible parties and timelines regular followup visits are also conducted to ensure suppliers are completing their corrective action plans on a timely basis  public attention surrounding the situation in bangladesh prompted us to share our building stability reports publicly over the years we have learned that while the factory assessment process is important the key to lasting improvement in working conditions is for our suppliers themselves to understand and appreciate the importance of operating a responsible workplace today we are spending more time and resources working with our suppliers to improve their human resource and environment health and safety programs training their personnel and developing the systems to operate a responsible workplace community involvement the levi strauss foundation focuses on funding programs that strengthen worker rights and improve the working and living conditions for the people who make our products through these grants we support innovative local regional and global nonprofit organizations that encourage the enforcement of labor laws increase awareness around health care issues and promote access to assetbuilding and life skills training for our employees contractors and their families government advocacy as pioneers in the fight for fair employment practices we firmly believe that workplace standards and worker rights should be an integral part of all bilateral regional or multilateral trade negotiations levi strauss  co was the first and only major multinational company to publicly advocate for linkage of trade and labor incorporating key workplace standards and worker rights provisions within the context of trade agreements and we continue to do so whenever and wherever we can — through congressional testimony meetings with senior government officials trade negotiations and multistakeholder initiatives industry collaboration in many cases we are not the only apparel company working with a given supplier one of the reasons we are transparent about our suppliers is to reach out to other apparel brands and organizations to see how we can work together in the factories we share by getting the rest of the industry involved we are able to send a stronger message to our suppliers about the importance of operating a responsible workplace view a full list of

stronger better learn how we craft clothing to fit your life innovation uniforms of progress learn how we’re innovating for the next generation sustainability made with purpose learn how we’re creating products that benefit people and the planet our story is behind every seam strength that’s the meaning behind our iconic two horses logo — and it still resonates today more than a century since it was first branded into a leather patch of ® jeans in  when levi strauss coinvented the blue jean in  he didn’t know that he was creating a global brand that would become known for selfexpression and classic american cool and that’s the beauty of the levi’s® story craftsmanship levi’s® clothing is crafted for life unrivalled construction tried and tested american originals no matter how you say it every piece of levi’s® clothing embodies a sense of craft and quality — from the classic fit of levi’s® ® jeans to the refined details of levi’s® made  crafted collection for us

fashion art and function the colors you choose are an expression of who you are that’s why we offer a range of colors to suit all your wearing occasions levi’s® rivets made strong enough for american cowboys and miners the levi’s® rivet has become a standard in quality design around the world — and it all started with two american entrepreneurs joining forces during the gold rush era as the owner of a san francisco generalgoods store in  levi strauss supplied denim to jacob davis a tailor who had created copper rivets to fasten pockets to pants with the goal of making workpants as strong as possible jacobs’ invention was so good that he couldn’t keep up with demand enter strauss who pioneered product development and manufacturing of the original levi’s® blue jeans details make the design we’re a bit obsessed with selvedge selvedge or selvage meaning “selfedge” — the natural edge of a roll of denim fabric — is part of our dna as an ode to the original levi’s® signature redstitched selvedge we created levi’s® selvedge a collection known for its heavyweight raw denim and khaki and red stitching on its inside seam woven on traditional shuttle looms that operate at a slow speed the timeconsuming process of making selvedge denim ranks it the highest quality in the world learn more about selvedge watch the video denim and the machine our looms keep up with global demand rooting back to the s denim was produced on ” looms which operated at a relatively slow speed due to increased demand for denim in the s levi strauss  co replaced the old shuttlestyle looms with modern projectile looms the new looms produce wider fabric at a faster speed we take every stitch seriously whether you favor the singleneedle stitching found in skinny men’s jeans doubleneedle stitching in

have a good idea is to have lots of them luckily we have no shortage of ideas — and they’re largely inspired by you from our rivet patent in  to the levi’s® commuter series antimicrobial protective fabric to environmental advances of the waterless™ collection every levi’s® innovation starts when we ask ourselves “what can we do better” as an international team who wears our own designs we view fashion as a merger of art innovation and sustainability after all levi’s® jeans are what the next generation wears — and we take that role to heart here are a few examples of how we’re constantly reimagining the levi’s® brand… waterless™ — start small think big in  we launched levi’s® waterless™ a collection produced with significantly less water instead of using water during the stonewash process we use a drystone process that produces similar results in more than a dozen classic levi’s® jeans including ® jeans tm jeans and the levi’s® trucker jacket we’ve already saved over  million liters of water with waterless™ and this is just the beginning — we’re committed to doing right by the planet in as many ways possible want to help save water watch this video watch this video

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans

that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no

anonymous overall comfort look i love the look of this jacket and the fit i am  and have trouble finding coats that fit in the arms as well around the medium fit nicely without being too baggy i havent worn it yet because of the weather i got the army green and i like the deeper darker color than most traditional muted greens zaire short sleeve woven posted may   reviewer brandon from wa overall comfort look love this shirt great looking pattern slim look but as room for a cool comfortable warm weather shirt looks good with pants and shorts classic light weight parka posted may   reviewer anonymous overall comfort look i ordered an xs usually wear xs or s and it fit great with a little room to spare i really debated on whether to keep this but ended up returning it since i didnt love it merle short sleeve woven posted may   reviewer anonymous overall comfort look this xxl has a surprisingly short cut my tshirt sleeves underneath stick out far past this shirt and it untucks every time i bent over the picture shows sleeves halfway down biceps more like top of bicep on me classic light weight parka posted may   reviewer anonymous from connecticut overall comfort look fabulous spring jacket for when you dont need something warm but its just a little too chilly to go it alone with a shirt got it for myself but am now having trouble keeping my teenage daughters grubby paws off it i do agree with a previous reviewer that it can be a little tight across the upper armsback when you reach forward they probably should have cut it a little more generously or put in a gusset at the back of the arms but it is so great otherwise that i am willing to forgive it that small issue fashion light weight parka w roll up sleeve posted may   reviewer anonymous from benicia ca overall comfort look love this light weight jacket will look great with skinny jeans and even shorts for those breezy summer nights also having a hood is a plusjust in case color is very nice deep navy jacket is true to size yuna tank top posted may   reviewer oliver klozoff from mn overall comfort look overall i was really pleased with this item the design looks amazing in person and the lightweight knit of the tank is super comfy on hot days things to note that i thought were hard to see in the photo that i noticed upon opening there is a tiny red levis tag on the medial side of the chest pocket i think its really noticeable in person so i removed that the shirttail hem means that the front and back parts of the tank are longer and the sides are shorter a little funky not entirely preferable but it doesnt bother me too much helps the tank fit more slimly at the waist which is nice there is a seam going down the very middle of your back i really dislike this and its why i docked a star from style there are seams on the sides so this seam is literally just for show and serves no purpose looks really bad fortunately the bolder design hides it a bit fashion light weight parka w roll up sleeve posted apr   reviewer patricia moberly from in overall comfort look i have had this jacket now for  weeks and i love it i am a size  to   tall i tried s and m but stuck with the m which is comfy and roomy enough it is perfect for walking the dog there are so many pockets for my phone doggie bags keys treats etc the color is a rich green khaki and goes with everything i love the hood because it is light weight a generous size and perfect if it starts to rain i hardly ever take the time to write reviews  so this truly is a winner i am thinking of purchasing a second one  put it away for the day this one wears out tarvaris tank top posted apr   reviewer anonymous overall comfort look the material is very comfortable and the quality is great a little expensive but is a great product fashion light weight parka w roll up sleeve posted apr   reviewer kelly from seoul korea apo overall comfort look this is a cute jacket and the olive green is so pretty i sized down based on others reviews saying it ran large but still found it a little bit tight in the shoulders if i wore a long sleeve shirt that wouldve been a little too tight in the sleeves i really liked all of the pockets but wish that the jacket was lined up as well so that it was a little warmer the roll up sleeves were a plus with cute lining and the drawstring allowed you to accentuate your waist and not make it so baggy i would have never paid the original  that this jacket cost though thank you for registering now dont miss out on the good stuff yes please subscribe me to receive promotional
