elijah muhammad and malcolm x around that time clarence x became disenchanted with the organization although the root of his qualms is not known noi members have offered contradictory accounts of the

lifestyles of their senior leadership or malcolm xs distrust of him dora smith elected to stay with the group prompting the couples separation before leaving the noi clarence x had begun to doubt their teaching that wallace fard muhammad was a divine messenger he believed that the nois teachings were contradictory because they taught that god is black but encouraged reverence of fard muhammad who was not of exclusively african descent clarence x concluded that divinity was found in all black men rather than in a single person several times before he left the noi he was censured by leadership for these assertions his friend john x elected to leave with him malcolm x also left the noi in  and remained on good terms with clarence x clarence x did not join malcolm xs newly created

wisdom he referred to this system as living mathematics during its development he was imprisoned on firearms charges while john x was in prison clarence x taught a system of beliefs he referred to as supreme wisdom which he saw as the core of islam to groups of young men he was assisted by his friend james howard with whom he developed a modified version of living mathematics supreme mathematics and an accompanying doctrine about letters the supreme alphabet the development of these systems considered a divine science by adherents may have been influenced by the teachings of sufism like some schools of sufism they found esoteric meanings in the alphabet david smydra of the boston globe compares these teachings to kabbalah felicia miyakawa of middle tennessee state university sees similarities to gnosticism and kemetism clarence x developed novel teachings assigning backronyms to familiar words he stated that the letters of the word allah stood for arm leg leg arm head signifying the human body this was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature he named parts of the new york area after locations in the middle east that are significant to islam harlem was referred to as mecca and brooklyn medina other disaffected noi members including some who served the fruit of islam were soon drawn to his burgeoning group several people from the noi who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to elijah muhammad and malcolm x also joined clarence x incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders in the groups early years some five percenters attended noi events and clarence xs theology had much in common with the teachings of the noi although there were notable differences he taught his followers that he was an incarnation of god and they each were gods his followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for god clarence x taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of african descent not found in europeans and their descendants echoing statements made by elijah muhammad he did not enforce the nois strict moral rules one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the noi including gambling alcohol consumption and drug use clarence x told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong he strictly forbade the consumption of pork arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the united states such as rats and dogs and hence should not be consumed owing to their belief that black men are gods the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet early members of the group often proselytized on street corners for hours and clarence xs assistants led classes about the groups teachings strictly enforcing study habits he instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters once they did so they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths these lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms rather than hold services in mosques they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments which were often held outdoors attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that ted swedenburg of the university of arkansas has compared to quaker meetings clarence xs group was initially known as the suns of almighty god allah or the blood brothers after malcolm xs death the group became known as the five percenters or the five percent nation the name was drawn from the nois claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about god clarence x considered his movement to be the five percent of the noi that still held to truth and integrity the other  percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt clarence x assembled an inner circle of assistants nine of whom are referred to by five percenters as the first born they are said to embody his attributes the assistants were assigned to spread the groups teachings to younger people many of whom took african names including some from nonislamic societies clarence x taught afrocentrism to his disciples and often wore a dashiki male five percenters members frequently wore tasseled kufis and female members wore colorful african head wraps some five percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft others intentionally committed minor legal infractions hoping to proselytize to others who had been arrested clarence xs followers saw him as a divine messenger and referred to him as father allah this elevated him to a higher position than elijah muhammad who had deemed himself the messenger of allah eventually clarence x stopped identifying himself as a muslim and spoke out against the reverence of fard muhammad casting him as a mystery god he rejected the idea that god is invisible which he felt weakened people he encouraged his followers to learn about and respect other spiritual traditions although female converts were initially referred to as nurses clarence x renamed them earths in  he taught that women were not gods as he believed that they were created by man and did not possess creative power in his view women could nurture but only men could make children women were said to resemble the earth in their ability to sustain life clarence x had a patriarchal philosophy and the five percenters were initially overwhelmingly male he spoke in favor of fathers arranging their daughters marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as god polygamy or serial monogamy were allowed and legal marriage was discouraged clarence x encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control oppositionedit noi leaders were angry that clarence x freely taught portions of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop he refused clarence x also experienced conflict within his family his children did not revere him and hostility quickly developed between core five percenters and some of his sons when willeen jowers brought them to visit him on december   clarence x was shot twice in the torso while at a popular gathering place in the basement of a harlem tenement he was brought to harlem hospital where he was treated and released he later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later in a  study of the five percent movement american journalist michael muhammad knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a christ figure the identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown knight notes that law enforcement and rival muslim groups both had a motive to attack clarence x some five percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts clarence xs companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence while recuperating from his wounds clarence x sought to distinguish his movement from other islamic movements abandoning arabic greetings for english expressions the five percenters soon attracted attention from media and law enforcement local papers published negative coverage of the group casting them as a violent hate group or a street gang the new york amsterdam news reported that clarence x had threatened to kill white children if his group did not receive a government subsidy in  the fbi initiated an investigation of his group and may have provided sensationalized rumors to the press that year fbi director j edgar hoover deemed clarence x as a harlem rowdy and feared that he would form ties with more dangerous groups the fbi developed a detailed file on clarence x in  hoover described him as a potential threat to the president of the us and sent a detailed folder about him to the united states secret service arrestedit bellevue psychiatric hospital after malcolm xs death in  clarence x mourned his loss but did not attend his funeral in may  while visiting the site of mosque no  then

defend himself in court he told the judge that he was allah and that the city would face grave judgment if he were not released the judge disregarded his prognostication and set his bail at  at a court date in june about  five percenters protested outside the court afterwards several were arrested on charges of making molotov cocktails in july the court sent clarence x to bellevue hospital center for a psychiatric examination while in the hospital he made a few disciples and communicated with some followers through a hospital window under his instructions five percenters resisted future noi leader louis farrakhans attempts to convert them knight states that clarence xs psychiatric results were not processed for an unusually long time he posits that the delay was due to fbi involvement and argues that clarence x was a political prisoner in november  clarence x was ruled incompetent to stand trial and committed to the new york state department of mental hygiene which placed him at the matteawan state hospital for the criminally insane after he declared himself allah and a master gambler the doctors concluded that he had schizophrenic reaction paranoid type with delusions of grandeur he faced indefinite commitment many five percenters and their converts traveled to the hospital to meet with him and receive instruction he also proselytized to fellow inmates converting one young white man who later became a committed follower while clarence x was in prison the five percenters continued to proselytize and teach their doctrines he instructed his followers to adopt names different from those used in the noi to differentiate their group after attaining a certain degree of knowledge of the groups doctrines members were allowed to adopt the surname allah and sometimes god as a first name this was in recognition of clarence xs teachings that black men were gods and that each member should worship himself his followers often took the name allah but would refrain from referring to themselves as such in his presence in deference to his authority after a decision pate v robinson by the supreme court of the united states in  limits were placed on the confinement of mentally ill criminals causing many to be released clarence x was consequently released in march  cooperation and conflictedit john lindsay in  in mid new york city mayor john lindsay sought to develop closer ties with leaders of impoverished neighborhoods prompted in part by concerns voiced by the new york police department nypd the mayor dispatched one of his aides barry gottehrer to meet with clarence x belying his fearsome reputation clarence x had a congenial meeting with gottehrer during which he requested more bus routes and school funding clarence x subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at gracie mansion the mayors official residence the city provided buses for five percenters to travel to a long island park and with help from the national urban league obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school it became known as the allah school in mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools tensions soon formed between the five percenters and the schools overseers clarence x desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized in  gottehrer chronicled his friendship with clarence x in the mayors man the book was well received by some five percenters who republished portions of it after it went out of print they have not reprinted the entire book owing to a passage in which gottehrer relates that clarence x offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter in february  lindsay estimated that there were about  to  five percenters some of clarence xs followers attempted to create breakaway groups proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements they generally retained aspects of five percenter doctrine with different emphases after the assassination of martin luther king jr in april  lindsay feared that rioting would occur in harlem he traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences clarence x and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets clarence x also instructed his followers to try to prevent violence and looting he was commended by the citys leadership for his efforts and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of five percenter teachings and portions of the quran willieen jowers recalled that clarence x admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time he later described himself as neither antiwhite nor problack and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings his white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in harlem during the february  noreaster he was accepted as a five percenter as clarence x maintained that civilization—rather than race—was valued by the group clarence x made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed contrary to his radical reputation he endorsed some conservative positions in the late s including capital punishment respect for the us flag and american involvement in vietnam he also allowed his supporters to attend christmas celebrations knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement clarence x was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young five percenters and won some concessions from the institutions leadership some secular black leaders disliked him owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric on one occasion he was invited to address an audience of black marxists then spoke to them about numerology around  clarence x fathered a son with a young convert named gusavia that year gloria steinem published an article about clarence x in new york magazine she blamed the noi for the previous attempt to kill him arguing that they were angered by his claim to be allah and thus above elijah muhammad clarence x also received coverage from international media including a canadian television program deathedit by  clarence x became very tired and slept little he feared that he would be killed and instructed his followers to remain strong if he died on june  he spent time with several of his disciples at their school he left the school between  and  am on june

apartment building that morning several people from the mayors office met with his family and the mayor later visited the five percenters school to express condolences clarence xs funeral was held four days after his death it was attended by about  people and was followed by a procession through harlem his death put the leadership of his movement in question—there was no clear successor at that time his followers were primarily teenagers and several of his top leaders subsequently struggled with drug addiction most local media sources gave clarence x positive coverage in the wake of his death the daily news connected his murder with the recent death of noi activist charles kenyatta casting them as part of a muslim war the mayor believed that the nypd told them this and was angered by their claim louis farrakhan denied culpability maintaining that he had good relations with clarence x nypd investigators suspected that he was killed by members of an extortion ring possibly connected to the fair play for cuba committee in august  an arrest was made in connection with his murder the suspect denied involvement and charges were soon dropped five percenters have posited different culprits including the cia the noi or a disgruntled follower legacy and receptionedit five percenter membership plunged after clarence xs death but rebounded in  after new leadership emerged and revitalized the group after his death the group was not dominated by a single leader this may have been a result of their teaching that all black men are gods which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable knight doubts that clarence x set out to build a movement or a culture but after his death the movement expanded and gained converts across the united states five percenters have celebrated clarence xs birthday as a holiday and minimized the descriptions of his flaws in their accounts of his life numerous apocryphal stories from his life have circulated among the group some accounts have claimed that he gambled only as a means to reach others with his teachings he did not leave behind a record of his teachings and the group had few formalized tenets at the time of his death in the following decades the groups doctrine became more complicated akbar muhammad of the noi described clarence x as confused although relations between the five percenters and noi leaders have improved over time clarence xs teachings may have influenced the doctrines of dwight york founder of the nuwaubian nation york saw clarence xs teachings as an insufficient incomplete path lawyer sidney davidoff one of lindsays assistants deemed clarence x a little bit snakeoil salesman and a little bit crazy but no more unstable than anyone else preaching a gospel on the street corner davidoff saw clarence xs black supremacist teachings as a way to instill confidence in young people knight states that clarence x went from a harlem rowdy to a legitimate community leader and lindsay later cast

parts of the new york area after locations in the middle east that are significant to islam harlem was referred to as mecca and brooklyn medina other disaffected noi members including some who served the fruit of islam were soon drawn to his burgeoning group several people from the noi who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to elijah muhammad and malcolm x also joined clarence x incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders in the groups early years some five percenters attended noi events and clarence xs theology had much in common with the teachings of the noi although there were notable differences he taught his followers that he was an incarnation of god and they each were gods his followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for god clarence x taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of african descent not found in europeans and their descendants echoing statements made by elijah muhammad he did not enforce the nois strict moral rules one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the noi including gambling alcohol consumption and drug use clarence x told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong he strictly forbade the consumption of pork arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the united states such as rats and dogs and hence should not be consumed owing to their belief that black men are gods the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet early members of the group often proselytized on street corners for hours and clarence xs assistants led classes about the groups teachings strictly enforcing study habits he instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters once they did so they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths these lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms rather than hold services in mosques they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments which were often held outdoors attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that ted swedenburg of the university of arkansas has compared to quaker meetings clarence xs group was initially known as the suns of almighty god allah or the blood brothers after malcolm xs death the group became known as the five percenters or the five percent nation the name was drawn from the nois claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about god clarence x considered his movement to be the five percent of the noi that still held to truth and integrity the other  percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt clarence x assembled an inner circle of assistants nine of whom are referred to by five percenters as the first born they are said to embody his attributes the assistants were assigned to spread the groups teachings to younger people many of whom took african names including some from nonislamic societies clarence x taught afrocentrism to his disciples and often wore a dashiki male five percenters members frequently wore tasseled kufis and female members wore colorful african head wraps some five percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft others intentionally committed minor legal infractions hoping to proselytize to others who had been arrested clarence xs followers saw him as a divine messenger and referred to him as father allah this elevated him to a higher position than elijah muhammad who had deemed himself the messenger of allah eventually clarence x stopped identifying himself as a muslim and spoke out against the reverence of fard muhammad casting him as a mystery god he rejected the idea that god is invisible which he felt weakened people he encouraged his followers to learn about and respect other spiritual traditions although female converts were initially referred to as nurses clarence x renamed them earths in  he taught that women were not gods as he believed that they were created by man and did not possess creative power in his view women could nurture but only men could make children women were said to resemble the earth in their ability to sustain life clarence x had a patriarchal philosophy and the five percenters were initially overwhelmingly male he spoke in favor of fathers arranging their daughters marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as god polygamy or serial monogamy were allowed and legal marriage was discouraged clarence x encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control oppositionedit noi leaders were angry that clarence x freely taught portions of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop he refused clarence x also experienced conflict within his family his children did not revere him and hostility quickly developed between core five percenters and some of his sons when willeen jowers brought them to visit him on december   clarence x was shot twice in the torso while at a popular gathering place in the basement of a harlem tenement he was brought to harlem hospital where he was treated and released he later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later in a  study of the five percent movement american journalist michael muhammad knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a christ figure the identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown knight notes that law enforcement and rival muslim groups both had a motive to attack clarence x some five percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts clarence xs companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence while recuperating from his wounds clarence x sought to distinguish his movement from other islamic movements abandoning arabic greetings for english expressions the five percenters soon attracted attention from media and law enforcement local papers published negative coverage of the group casting them as a violent hate group or a street gang the new york amsterdam news reported that clarence x had threatened to kill white children if his group did not receive a government subsidy in  the fbi initiated an investigation of his group and may have provided sensationalized rumors to the press that year fbi director j edgar hoover deemed clarence x as a harlem rowdy and feared that he would form ties with more dangerous groups the fbi developed a detailed file on clarence x in  hoover described him as a

judgment if he were not released the judge disregarded his prognostication and set his bail at  at a court date in june about  five percenters protested outside the court afterwards several were arrested on charges of making molotov cocktails in july the court sent clarence x to bellevue hospital center for a psychiatric examination while in the hospital he made a few disciples and communicated with some followers through a hospital window under his instructions five percenters resisted future noi leader louis farrakhans attempts to convert them knight states that clarence xs psychiatric results were not processed for an unusually long time he posits that the delay was due to fbi involvement and argues that clarence x was a political prisoner in november  clarence x was ruled incompetent to stand trial and committed to the new york state department of mental hygiene which placed him at the matteawan state hospital for the criminally insane after he declared himself allah and a master gambler the doctors concluded that he had schizophrenic reaction paranoid type with delusions of grandeur he faced indefinite commitment many five percenters and their converts traveled to the hospital to meet with him and receive instruction he also proselytized to fellow inmates converting one young white man who later became a committed follower while clarence x was in prison the five percenters continued to proselytize and teach their doctrines he instructed his followers to adopt names different from those used in the noi to differentiate their group after attaining a certain degree of knowledge of the groups doctrines members were allowed to adopt the surname allah and sometimes god as a first name this was in recognition of clarence xs teachings that black men were gods and that each member should worship himself his followers often took the name allah but would refrain from referring to themselves as such in his presence in deference to his authority after a decision pate v robinson by the supreme court of the united states in  limits were placed on the confinement of mentally ill criminals causing many to be released clarence x was consequently released in march  cooperation and conflictedit john lindsay in  in mid new york city mayor john lindsay sought to develop closer ties with leaders of impoverished neighborhoods prompted in part by concerns voiced by the new york police department nypd the mayor dispatched one of his aides barry gottehrer to meet with clarence x belying his fearsome reputation clarence x had a congenial meeting with gottehrer during which he requested more bus routes and school funding clarence x subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at gracie mansion the mayors official residence the city provided buses for five percenters to travel to a long island park and with help from the national urban league obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school it became known as the allah school in mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools tensions soon formed between the five percenters and the schools overseers clarence x desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized in  gottehrer chronicled his friendship with clarence x in the mayors man the book was well received by some five percenters who republished portions of it after it went out of print they have not reprinted the entire book owing to a passage in which gottehrer relates that clarence x offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter in february  lindsay estimated that there were about  to  five percenters some of clarence xs followers attempted to create breakaway groups proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements they generally retained aspects of five percenter doctrine with different emphases after the assassination of martin luther king jr in april  lindsay feared that rioting would occur in harlem he traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences clarence x and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets clarence x also instructed his followers to try to prevent violence and looting he was commended by the citys leadership for his efforts and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of five percenter teachings and portions of the quran willieen jowers recalled that clarence x admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time he later described himself as neither antiwhite nor problack and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings his white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in harlem during the february  noreaster he was accepted as a five percenter as clarence x maintained that civilization—rather than race—was valued by the group clarence x made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed contrary to his radical reputation he endorsed some conservative positions in the late s including capital punishment respect for the us flag and american involvement in vietnam he also allowed his supporters to attend christmas celebrations knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement clarence x was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young five percenters and won some concessions from the institutions leadership some secular black leaders disliked him owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric on one occasion he was invited to address an audience of black marxists then spoke to them about numerology around  clarence x fathered a son with a young convert named gusavia that year gloria steinem published an article about clarence x in new york magazine she blamed the noi for the previous attempt to kill him arguing that they were angered by his claim to be allah and thus above elijah muhammad clarence x

followers to remain strong if he died on june  he spent time with several of his disciples at their school he left the school between  and  am on june  and then gambled for an hour or two as was his occasional practice he traveled to dora smiths house to rest he was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him while he was in the lobby of her apartment building that morning several people from the mayors office met with his family and the mayor later visited the five percenters school to express condolences clarence xs funeral was held four days after his death it was attended by about  people and was followed by a procession through harlem his death put the leadership of his movement in question—there was no clear successor at that time his followers were primarily teenagers and several of his top leaders subsequently struggled with drug addiction most local media sources gave clarence x positive coverage in the wake of his death the daily news connected his murder with the recent death of noi activist charles kenyatta casting them as part of a muslim war the mayor believed that the nypd told them this and was angered by their claim louis farrakhan denied culpability maintaining that he had good relations with clarence x nypd investigators suspected that he was killed by members of an extortion ring possibly connected to the fair play for cuba committee in august  an arrest was made in connection with his murder the suspect denied involvement and charges were soon dropped five percenters have posited different culprits including the cia the noi or a disgruntled follower legacy and receptionedit five percenter membership plunged after clarence xs death but rebounded in  after new leadership emerged and revitalized the group after his death the group was not dominated by a single leader this may have been a result of their teaching that all black men are gods which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable knight doubts that clarence x set out to build a movement or a culture but after his death the movement expanded and gained converts across the united states five percenters have celebrated clarence xs birthday as a holiday and minimized the descriptions of his flaws in their accounts of his life numerous apocryphal stories from his life have circulated among the group some accounts have claimed that he gambled only as a means to reach others with his teachings he did not leave behind a record of his teachings and the group had few formalized tenets at the time of his death in the following decades the groups doctrine became more complicated akbar muhammad of the noi described clarence x as confused although relations between the five percenters and noi leaders have improved over time clarence xs teachings may have influenced the doctrines of dwight york founder of the nuwaubian nation york saw clarence xs teachings as an insufficient incomplete path lawyer sidney davidoff one of lindsays assistants deemed clarence x a little bit snakeoil salesman and a little bit crazy but no more unstable than anyone else preaching a gospel on the street corner davidoff saw clarence xs black supremacist teachings as a way to instill confidence in young people knight states that clarence x went from a harlem rowdy to a legitimate community leader and lindsay later cast clarence xs role in the city as similar to that of al

meaning of each letter and number was said to provide deep truths about god and the universe clarence x referred to his new movement as the five percenters referencing a noi teaching that only five percent of the population knew and promoted the truth about god one way that he distinguished his group from his previous faith was by rejecting dress codes or strict behavioral guidelines—he allowed

no  and changed his name to clarence x in accordance with noi practice before his conversion he often smoked marijuana and gambled activities forbidden by the noi after joining the group he studied the nois doctrines and quickly progressed within their organizational structure possibly thanks to skills learned in the military his responsibilities included teaching martial arts and serving on the fruit of islam security team he was also recognized as a skilled speaker and reached the rank of student minister at mosque no  by  he had come to the attention of the fbi—informants recorded his presence at rallies led by malcolm x the early s were a turbulent period for the noi unrest was caused by conflicts between leaders elijah muhammad and malcolm x around that time clarence x became disenchanted with the organization although the root of his qualms is not known noi members have offered contradictory accounts of the events that caused his exit and whether he left voluntarily his departure has been variously attributed to doubts about the nois theology violations of their moral code objections to the luxurious lifestyles of their senior leadership or malcolm xs distrust of him dora smith elected to stay with the group prompting the couples separation before leaving the noi clarence x had begun to doubt their teaching that wallace fard muhammad was a divine messenger he believed that the nois teachings were contradictory because they taught that god is black but encouraged reverence of fard muhammad who was not of exclusively african descent clarence x concluded that divinity was found in all black men rather than in a single person several times before he left the noi he was censured by leadership for these assertions his friend john x elected to leave with him malcolm x also left the noi in  and remained on good terms with clarence x clarence x did not join malcolm xs newly created group muslim mosque inc founding the five percentersedit after leaving the noi clarence x and john x continued to study the groups teachings sometimes while smoking marijuana they assumed new names clarence x took allah and john x abu shahidc after reading an noi book with  riddles known as the lostfound lessons john x concluded that numbers represented specific concepts such as knowledge or wisdom he referred to this system as living mathematics during its development he was imprisoned on firearms charges while john x was in prison clarence x taught a system of beliefs he referred to as supreme wisdom which he saw as the core of islam to groups of young men he was assisted by his friend james howard with whom he developed a modified version of living mathematics supreme mathematics and an accompanying doctrine about letters the supreme alphabet the development of these systems considered a divine science by adherents may have been influenced by the teachings of sufism like some schools of sufism they found esoteric meanings in the alphabet david smydra of the boston globe compares these teachings to kabbalah felicia miyakawa of middle tennessee state university sees similarities to gnosticism and kemetism clarence x developed novel teachings assigning backronyms to familiar words he stated that the letters of the word allah stood for arm leg leg arm head signifying the human body this was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature he named parts of the new york area after locations in the middle east that are significant to islam harlem was referred to as mecca and brooklyn medina other disaffected noi members including some who served the fruit of islam were soon drawn to his burgeoning group several people from the noi who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to elijah muhammad and malcolm x also joined clarence x incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders in the groups early years some five percenters attended noi events and clarence xs theology had much in common with the teachings of the noi although there were notable differences he taught his followers that he was an incarnation of god and they each were gods his followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for god clarence x taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of african descent not found in europeans and their descendants echoing statements made by elijah muhammad he did not enforce the nois strict moral rules one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the noi including gambling alcohol consumption and drug use clarence x told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong he strictly forbade the consumption of pork arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the united states such as rats and dogs and hence should not be consumed owing to their belief that black men are gods the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet early members of the group often proselytized on street corners for hours and clarence xs assistants led classes about the groups teachings strictly enforcing study habits he instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters once they did so they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths these lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms rather than hold services in mosques they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments which were often held outdoors attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that ted swedenburg of the university of arkansas has compared to quaker meetings clarence xs group was initially known as the suns of almighty god allah or the blood brothers after malcolm xs death the group became known as the five percenters or the five percent nation the name was drawn from the nois claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about god clarence x considered his movement to be the five percent of the noi that still held to truth and integrity the other  percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt clarence x assembled an inner circle of assistants nine of whom are referred to by five percenters as the first born they are said to embody his attributes the assistants were assigned to spread the groups teachings to younger people many of whom took african names including some from nonislamic societies clarence x taught afrocentrism to his disciples and often wore a dashiki male five percenters members frequently wore tasseled kufis and female members wore colorful african head wraps some five percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft others intentionally committed minor legal infractions hoping to proselytize to others who had been arrested clarence xs followers saw him as a divine messenger and referred to him as father allah this elevated him to a higher position than elijah muhammad who had deemed himself the messenger of allah eventually clarence x stopped identifying himself as a muslim and spoke out against the reverence of fard muhammad casting him as a mystery god he rejected the idea that god is invisible which he felt weakened people he encouraged his followers to learn about and respect other spiritual traditions although female converts were initially referred to as nurses clarence x renamed them earths in  he taught that women were not gods as he believed that they were created by man and did not possess creative power in his view women could nurture but only men could make children women were said to resemble the earth in their ability to sustain life clarence x had a patriarchal philosophy and the five percenters were initially overwhelmingly male he spoke in favor of fathers arranging their daughters marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as god polygamy or serial monogamy were allowed and legal marriage was discouraged clarence x encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control oppositionedit noi leaders were angry that clarence x freely taught portions of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop he refused clarence x also experienced conflict within his family his children did not revere him and hostility quickly developed between core five percenters and some of his sons when willeen jowers brought them to visit him on december   clarence x was shot twice in the torso while at a popular gathering place in the basement of a harlem tenement he was brought to harlem hospital where he was treated and released he later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later in a  study of the five percent movement american journalist michael muhammad knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a christ figure the identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown knight notes that law enforcement and rival muslim groups both had a motive to attack clarence x some five percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts clarence xs companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence while recuperating from his wounds clarence x sought to distinguish his movement from other islamic movements abandoning arabic greetings for english expressions the five percenters soon attracted attention from media and law enforcement local papers published negative coverage of the group casting them as a violent hate group or a street gang the new york amsterdam news reported that clarence x had threatened to kill white children if his group did not receive a government subsidy in  the fbi initiated an investigation of his group and may have provided sensationalized rumors to the press that year fbi

status he rejected the belief in an invisible god teaching that god could be found within each black man in his view women were earths that complemented and nurtured men he believed that they should be submissive to men he and a few assistants retained some noi teachings and pioneered novel interpretations of them they devised teachings about the meaning of letters and numerals understanding the meaning of each letter and number was said to provide deep truths about god and the universe clarence x referred to his new movement as the five percenters referencing a noi teaching that only five percent of the population knew and promoted the truth about god one way that he distinguished his group from his previous faith was by rejecting dress codes or strict behavioral guidelines—he allowed

stationed in korea from  to  where he served as an infantryman in the korean war after returning to the us he lived in harlem and served in the united states army reserve until  during his military

no  and changed his name to clarence x in accordance with noi practice before his conversion he often smoked marijuana and gambled activities forbidden by the noi after joining the group he studied the nois doctrines and quickly progressed within their organizational structure possibly thanks to skills learned in the military his responsibilities included teaching martial arts and serving on the fruit of islam security team he was also recognized as a skilled speaker and reached the rank of student minister at mosque no  by  he had come to the attention of the fbi—informants recorded his presence at rallies led by malcolm x the early s were a turbulent period for the noi unrest was caused by conflicts between leaders elijah muhammad and malcolm x around that time clarence x became disenchanted with the organization although the root of his qualms is not known noi members have offered contradictory accounts of the events that caused his exit and whether he left voluntarily his departure has been variously attributed to doubts about the nois theology violations of their moral code objections to the luxurious lifestyles of their senior leadership or malcolm xs distrust of him dora smith elected to stay with the group prompting the couples separation before leaving the noi clarence x had begun to doubt their teaching that wallace fard muhammad was a divine messenger he believed that the nois teachings were contradictory because they taught that god is black but encouraged reverence of fard muhammad who was not of exclusively african descent clarence x concluded that divinity was found in all black men rather than in a single person several times before he left the noi he was censured by leadership for these assertions his friend john x elected to leave with him malcolm x also left the noi in  and remained on good terms with clarence x clarence x did not join malcolm xs newly created group muslim mosque inc founding the five percentersedit after leaving the noi clarence x and john x continued to study the groups teachings sometimes while smoking marijuana they assumed new names clarence x took allah and john x abu shahidc after reading an noi book with  riddles known as the lostfound lessons john x concluded that numbers represented specific concepts such as knowledge or wisdom he referred to this system as living mathematics during its development he was imprisoned on firearms charges while john x was in prison clarence x taught a system of beliefs he referred to as supreme wisdom which he saw as the core of islam to groups of young men he was assisted by his friend james howard with whom he developed a modified version of living mathematics supreme mathematics and an accompanying doctrine about letters the supreme alphabet the development of these systems considered a divine science by adherents may have been influenced by the teachings of sufism like some schools of sufism they found esoteric meanings in the alphabet david smydra of the boston globe compares these teachings to kabbalah felicia miyakawa of middle tennessee state university sees similarities to gnosticism and kemetism clarence x developed novel teachings assigning backronyms to familiar words he stated that the letters of the word allah stood for arm leg leg arm head signifying the human body this was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature he named parts of the new york area after locations in the middle east that are significant to islam harlem was referred to as mecca and brooklyn medina other disaffected noi members including some who served the fruit of islam were soon drawn to his burgeoning group several people from the noi who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to elijah muhammad and malcolm x also joined clarence x incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders in the groups early years some five percenters attended noi events and clarence xs theology had much in common with the teachings of the noi although there were notable differences he taught his followers that he was an incarnation of god and they each were gods his followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for god clarence x taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of african descent not found in europeans and their descendants echoing statements made by elijah muhammad he did not enforce the nois strict moral rules one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the noi including gambling alcohol consumption and drug use clarence x told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong he strictly forbade the consumption of pork arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the united states such as rats and dogs and hence should not be consumed owing to their belief that black men are gods the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet early members of the group often proselytized on street corners for hours and clarence xs assistants led classes about the groups teachings strictly enforcing study habits he instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters once they did so they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths these lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms rather than hold services in mosques they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments which were often held outdoors attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that ted swedenburg of the university of arkansas has compared to quaker meetings clarence xs group was initially known as the suns of almighty god allah or the blood brothers after malcolm xs death the group became known as the five percenters or the five percent nation the name was drawn from the nois claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about god clarence x considered his movement to be the five percent of the noi that still held to truth and integrity the other  percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt clarence x assembled an inner circle of assistants nine of whom are referred to by five percenters as the first born they are said to embody his attributes the assistants were assigned to spread the groups teachings to younger people many of whom took african names including some from nonislamic societies clarence x taught afrocentrism to his disciples and often wore a dashiki male five percenters members frequently wore tasseled kufis and female members wore colorful african head wraps some five percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft others intentionally committed minor legal infractions hoping to proselytize to others who had been arrested clarence xs followers saw him as a divine messenger and referred to him as father allah this elevated him to a higher position than elijah muhammad who had deemed himself the messenger of allah eventually clarence x stopped identifying himself as a muslim and spoke out against the reverence of fard muhammad casting him as a mystery god he rejected the idea that god is invisible which he felt weakened people he encouraged his followers to learn about and respect other spiritual traditions although female converts were initially referred to as nurses clarence x renamed them earths in  he taught that women were not gods as he believed that they were created by man and did not possess creative power in his view women could nurture but only men could make children women were said to resemble the earth in their ability to sustain life clarence x had a patriarchal philosophy and the five percenters were initially overwhelmingly male he spoke in favor of fathers arranging their daughters marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as god polygamy or serial monogamy were allowed and legal marriage was discouraged clarence x encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control oppositionedit noi leaders were angry that clarence x freely taught portions of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop he refused clarence x also experienced conflict within his family his children did not revere him and hostility quickly developed between core five percenters and some of his sons when willeen jowers brought them to visit him on december   clarence x was shot twice in the torso while at a popular gathering place in the basement of a harlem tenement he was brought to harlem hospital where he was treated and released he later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later in a  study of the five percent movement american journalist michael muhammad knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a christ figure the identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown knight notes that law enforcement and rival muslim groups both had a motive to attack clarence x some five percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts clarence xs companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence while recuperating from his wounds clarence x sought to distinguish his movement from other islamic movements abandoning arabic greetings for english expressions the five percenters soon attracted attention from media and law enforcement local papers published negative coverage of the group casting them as a violent hate group or a street gang the new york amsterdam news reported that clarence x had threatened to kill white children if his group did not receive a government subsidy in  the fbi initiated an investigation of his group and may have provided sensationalized rumors to the press that year fbi director j edgar hoover deemed clarence x as a harlem rowdy and feared that he would form ties with more dangerous groups the fbi developed a detailed file on clarence x in  hoover described him as a potential threat to the president of the us and sent a detailed folder about him to the united states secret service arrestedit bellevue psychiatric hospital after malcolm xs death in  clarence x mourned his loss but did not attend his funeral in may  while visiting the site of mosque no  then closed clarence x and several of his companions were told to leave by a police officer they left began to vandalize nearby buildings and blocked the street near the former headquarters of muslim mosque inc more police arrived and subdued clarence x after an altercation bringing him into custody with several of his followers after being arrested he refused to identify himself and was charged with assault and drug possession about  of his followers attended his arraignment but were removed from the court after shouting peace clarence x proclaimed his innocence and announced his intent to defend himself in court he told the judge that he was allah and that the city would face grave judgment if he were not released the judge disregarded his prognostication and set his bail at  at a court date in june about  five percenters protested outside the court afterwards several were arrested on charges of making molotov cocktails in july the court sent clarence x to bellevue hospital center for a psychiatric examination while in the hospital he made a few disciples and communicated with some followers through a hospital window under his instructions five percenters resisted future noi leader louis farrakhans attempts to convert them knight states that clarence xs psychiatric results were not processed for an unusually long time he posits that the delay was due to fbi involvement and argues that clarence x was a political prisoner in november  clarence x was ruled incompetent to stand trial and committed to the new york state department of mental hygiene which placed him at the matteawan state hospital for the criminally insane after he declared himself allah and a master gambler the doctors concluded that he had schizophrenic reaction paranoid type with delusions of grandeur he faced indefinite commitment many five percenters and their converts traveled to the hospital to meet with him and receive instruction he also proselytized to fellow inmates converting one young white man who later became a committed follower while clarence x was in prison the five percenters continued to proselytize and teach their doctrines he instructed his followers to adopt names different from those used in the noi to differentiate their group after attaining a certain degree of knowledge of the groups doctrines members were allowed to adopt the surname allah and sometimes god as a first name this was in recognition of clarence xs teachings that black men were gods and that each member should worship himself his followers often took the name allah but would refrain from referring to themselves as such in his presence in deference to his authority after a decision pate v robinson by the supreme court of the united states in  limits were placed on the confinement of mentally ill criminals causing many to be released clarence x was consequently released in march  cooperation and conflictedit john lindsay in  in mid new york city mayor john lindsay sought to develop closer ties with leaders of impoverished neighborhoods prompted in part by concerns voiced by the new york police department nypd the mayor dispatched one of his aides barry gottehrer to meet with clarence x belying his fearsome reputation clarence x had a congenial meeting with gottehrer during which he requested more bus routes and school funding clarence x subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at gracie mansion the mayors official residence the city provided buses for five percenters to travel to a long island park and with help from the national urban league obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school it became known as the allah school in mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools tensions soon formed between the five percenters and the schools overseers clarence x desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized in  gottehrer chronicled his friendship with clarence x in the mayors man the book was well received by some five percenters who republished portions of it after it went out of print they have not reprinted the entire book owing to a passage in which gottehrer relates that clarence x offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter in february  lindsay estimated that there were about  to  five percenters some of clarence xs followers attempted to create breakaway groups proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements they generally retained aspects of five percenter doctrine with different emphases after the assassination of martin luther king jr in april  lindsay feared that rioting would occur in harlem he traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences clarence x and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets clarence x also instructed his followers to try to prevent violence and looting he was commended by the citys leadership for his efforts and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of five percenter teachings and portions of the quran willieen jowers recalled that clarence x admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time he later described himself as neither antiwhite nor problack and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings his white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in harlem during the february  noreaster he was accepted as a five percenter as clarence x maintained that civilization—rather than race—was valued by the group clarence x made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed contrary to his radical reputation he endorsed some conservative positions in the late s including capital punishment respect for the us flag and american involvement in vietnam he also allowed his supporters to attend christmas celebrations knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement clarence x was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young five percenters and won some concessions from the institutions leadership some secular black leaders disliked him owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric on one occasion he was invited to address an audience of black marxists then spoke to them about numerology around  clarence x fathered a son with a young convert named gusavia that year gloria steinem published an article about clarence x in new york magazine she blamed the noi for the previous attempt to kill him arguing that they were angered by his claim to be allah and thus above elijah muhammad clarence x also received coverage from international media including a canadian television program deathedit by  clarence x became very tired and slept little he feared that he would be killed and instructed his followers to remain strong if he died on june  he spent time with several of his disciples at their school he left the school between  and  am on june  and then gambled for an hour or two as was his occasional practice he traveled to dora smiths house to rest he was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him while he was in the lobby of her apartment building that morning several people from the mayors office met with his family and the mayor later visited the five percenters school to express condolences clarence xs funeral was held four days after his death it was attended by about  people and was followed by a procession through harlem his death put the leadership of his movement in question—there was no clear successor at that time his followers were primarily teenagers and

minister before leaving for an unclear reason in  he enjoyed gambling which was condemned by the noi and disagreed with the nois teachings that wallace fard muhammad was a divine messenger after leaving the noi clarence x formed a new group with other former members he concluded that all black men were divine and took the name allah to symbolize this status he rejected the belief in an invisible god teaching that god could be found within each black man in his view women were earths that complemented and nurtured men he believed that they should be submissive to men he and a few assistants retained some noi teachings and pioneered novel interpretations of them they devised teachings about the meaning of letters and numerals understanding the meaning of each letter and number was said to provide deep truths about god and the universe clarence x referred to his new movement as the five percenters referencing a noi teaching that only five percent of the population knew and promoted the truth about god one way that he distinguished his group from his previous faith was by rejecting dress codes or strict behavioral guidelines—he allowed the consumption of alcohol and at times the use of illegal drugs clarence x was shot by an unknown assailant in  but survived the attack after an incident several months later in which he and several of his followers vandalized stores and fought with police he was arrested and placed in psychiatric care he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia he referred to himself as allah which had become his preferred name he was released

york city and several other prominent leaders expressed condolences to his followers although the five percenters faltered in the immediate aftermath of his death the movement rebounded after new

childhood virginia was racially segregated and he witnessed incidents of racism including a fight between his father and a white man that was sparked by racial tensions in  he moved with his mother to new york city where they settled in harlem he attended only two years of high school in  smith fathered a child clarence jowers with willieen jowers although he married a woman named dora smith in  he fathered another child otis jowers with willieen in  he also had several sons and daughters with dora smith joined the us army in the early s and was stationed in korea from  to  where he served as an infantryman in the korean war after returning to the us he lived in harlem and served in the united states army reserve until  during his military service he became skilled in karate mosque no  in  dora smith embraced the nation of islam noi while her husband was away and he converted after returning to new york by  he had registered at mosque no  and changed his name to clarence x in accordance with noi practice before his conversion he often smoked marijuana and gambled activities forbidden by the noi after joining the group he studied the nois doctrines and quickly progressed within their organizational structure possibly thanks to skills learned in the military his responsibilities included teaching martial arts and serving on the fruit of islam security team he was also recognized as a skilled speaker and reached the rank of student minister at mosque no  by  he had come to the attention of the fbi—informants recorded his presence at rallies led by malcolm x the early s were a turbulent period for the noi unrest was caused by conflicts between leaders elijah muhammad and malcolm x around that time clarence x became disenchanted with the organization although the root of his qualms is not known noi members have offered contradictory accounts of the events that caused his exit and whether he left voluntarily his departure has been variously attributed to doubts about the nois theology violations of their moral code objections to the luxurious lifestyles of their senior leadership or malcolm xs distrust of him dora smith elected to stay with the group prompting the couples separation before leaving the noi clarence x had begun to doubt their teaching that wallace fard muhammad was a divine messenger he believed that the nois teachings were contradictory because they taught that god is black but encouraged reverence of fard muhammad who was not of exclusively african descent clarence x concluded that divinity was found in all black men rather than in a single person several times before he left the noi he was censured by leadership for these assertions his friend john x elected to leave with him malcolm x also left the noi in  and remained on good terms with clarence x clarence x did not join malcolm xs newly created group muslim mosque inc founding the five percentersedit after leaving the noi clarence x and john x continued to study the groups teachings sometimes while smoking marijuana they assumed new names clarence x took allah and john x abu shahidc after reading an noi book with  riddles known as the lostfound lessons john x concluded that numbers represented specific concepts such as knowledge or wisdom he referred to this system as living mathematics during its development he was imprisoned on firearms charges while john x was in prison clarence x taught a system of beliefs he referred to as supreme wisdom which he saw as the core of islam to groups of young men he was assisted by his friend james howard with whom he developed a modified version of living mathematics supreme mathematics and an accompanying doctrine about letters the supreme alphabet the development of these systems considered a divine science by adherents may have been influenced by the teachings of sufism like some schools of sufism they found esoteric meanings in the alphabet david smydra of the boston globe compares these teachings to kabbalah felicia miyakawa of middle tennessee state university sees similarities to gnosticism and kemetism clarence x developed novel teachings assigning backronyms to familiar words he stated that the letters of the word allah stood for arm leg leg arm head signifying the human body this was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature he named parts of the new york area after locations in the middle east that are significant to islam harlem was referred to as mecca and brooklyn medina other disaffected noi members including some who served the fruit of islam were soon drawn to his burgeoning group several people from the noi who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to elijah muhammad and malcolm x also joined clarence x incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders in the groups early years some five percenters attended noi events and clarence xs theology had much in common with the teachings of the noi although there were notable differences he taught his followers that he was an incarnation of god and they each were gods his followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for god clarence x taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of african descent not found in europeans and their descendants echoing statements made by elijah muhammad he did not enforce the nois strict moral rules one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the noi including gambling alcohol consumption and drug use clarence x told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong he strictly forbade the consumption of pork arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the united states such as rats and dogs and hence should not be consumed owing to their belief that black men are gods the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet early members of the group often proselytized on street corners for hours and clarence xs assistants led classes about the groups teachings strictly enforcing study habits he instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters once they did so they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths these lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms rather than hold services in mosques they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments which were often held outdoors attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that ted swedenburg of the university of arkansas has compared to quaker meetings clarence xs group was initially known as the suns of almighty god allah or the blood brothers after malcolm xs death the group became known as the five percenters or the five percent nation the name was drawn from the nois claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about god clarence x considered his movement to be the five percent of the noi that still held to truth and integrity the other  percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt clarence x assembled an inner circle of assistants nine of whom are referred to by five percenters as the first born they are said to embody his attributes the assistants were assigned to spread the groups teachings to younger people many of whom took african names including some from nonislamic societies clarence x taught afrocentrism to his disciples and often wore a dashiki male five percenters members frequently wore tasseled kufis and female members wore colorful african head wraps some five percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft others intentionally committed minor legal infractions hoping to proselytize to others who had been arrested clarence xs followers saw him as a divine messenger and referred to him as father allah this elevated him to a higher position than elijah muhammad who had deemed himself the messenger of allah eventually clarence x stopped identifying himself as a muslim and spoke out against the reverence of fard muhammad casting him as a mystery god he rejected the idea that god is invisible which he felt weakened people he encouraged his followers to learn about and respect other spiritual traditions although female converts were initially referred to as nurses clarence x renamed them earths in  he taught that women were not gods as he believed that they were created by man and did not possess creative power in his view women could nurture but only men could make children women were said to resemble the earth in their ability to sustain life clarence x had a patriarchal philosophy and the five percenters were initially overwhelmingly male he spoke in favor of fathers arranging their daughters marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as god polygamy or serial monogamy were allowed and legal marriage was discouraged clarence x encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control oppositionedit noi leaders were angry that clarence x freely taught portions of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop he refused clarence x also experienced conflict within his family his children did not revere him and hostility quickly developed between core five percenters and some of his sons when willeen jowers brought them to visit him on december   clarence x was shot twice in the torso while at a popular gathering place in the basement of a harlem tenement he was brought to harlem hospital where he was treated and released he later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later in a  study of the five percent movement american journalist michael muhammad knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a christ figure the identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown knight notes that law enforcement and rival muslim groups both had a motive to attack clarence x some five percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts clarence xs companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence while recuperating from his wounds clarence x sought to distinguish his movement from other islamic movements abandoning arabic greetings for english expressions the five percenters soon attracted attention from media and law enforcement local papers published negative coverage of the group casting them as a violent hate group or a street gang the new york amsterdam news reported that clarence x had threatened to kill white children if his group did not receive a government subsidy in  the fbi initiated an investigation of his group and may have provided sensationalized rumors to the press that year fbi director j edgar hoover deemed clarence x as a harlem rowdy and feared that he would form ties with more dangerous groups the fbi developed a detailed file on clarence x in  hoover described him as a potential threat to the president of the us and sent a detailed folder about him to the united states secret service arrestedit bellevue psychiatric hospital after malcolm xs death in  clarence x mourned his loss but did not attend his funeral in may  while visiting the site of mosque no  then closed clarence x and several of his companions were told to leave by a police officer they left began to vandalize nearby buildings and blocked the street near the former headquarters of muslim mosque inc more police arrived and subdued clarence x after an altercation bringing him into custody with several of his followers after being arrested he refused to identify himself and was charged with assault and drug possession about  of his followers attended his arraignment but were removed from the court after shouting peace clarence x proclaimed his innocence and announced his intent to defend himself in court he told the judge that he was allah and that the city would face grave judgment if he were not released the judge disregarded his prognostication and set his bail at  at a court date in june about  five percenters protested outside the court afterwards several were arrested on charges of making molotov cocktails in july the court sent clarence x to bellevue hospital center for a psychiatric examination while in the hospital he made a few disciples and communicated with some followers through a hospital window under his instructions five percenters resisted future noi leader louis farrakhans attempts to convert them knight states that clarence xs psychiatric results were not processed for an unusually long time he posits that the delay was due to fbi involvement and argues that clarence x was a political prisoner in november  clarence x was ruled incompetent to stand trial and committed to the new york state department of mental hygiene which placed him at the matteawan state hospital for the criminally insane after he declared himself allah and a master gambler the doctors concluded that he had schizophrenic reaction paranoid type with delusions of grandeur he faced indefinite commitment many five percenters and their converts traveled to the hospital to meet with him and receive instruction he also proselytized to fellow inmates converting one young white man who later became a committed follower while clarence x was in prison the five percenters continued to proselytize and teach their doctrines he instructed his followers to adopt names different from those used in the noi to differentiate their group after attaining a certain degree of knowledge of the groups doctrines members were allowed to adopt the surname allah and sometimes god as a first name this was in recognition of clarence xs teachings that black men were gods and that each member should worship himself his followers often took the name allah but would refrain from referring to themselves as such in his presence in deference to his authority after a decision pate v robinson by the supreme court of the united states in  limits were placed on the confinement of mentally ill criminals causing many to be released clarence x was consequently released in march  cooperation and conflictedit john lindsay in  in mid new york city mayor john lindsay sought to develop closer ties with leaders of impoverished neighborhoods prompted in part by concerns voiced by the new york police department nypd the mayor dispatched one of his aides barry gottehrer to meet with clarence x belying his fearsome reputation clarence x had a congenial meeting with gottehrer during which he requested more bus routes and school funding clarence x subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at gracie mansion the mayors official residence the city provided buses for five percenters to travel to a long island park and with help from the national urban league obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school it became known as the allah school in mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools tensions soon formed between the five percenters and the schools overseers clarence x desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized in  gottehrer chronicled his friendship with clarence x in the mayors man the book was well received by some five percenters who republished portions of it after it went out of print they have not reprinted the entire book owing to a passage in which gottehrer relates that clarence x offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter in february  lindsay estimated that there were about  to  five percenters some of clarence xs followers attempted to create breakaway groups proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements they generally retained aspects of five percenter doctrine with different emphases after the assassination of martin luther king jr in april  lindsay feared that rioting would occur in harlem he traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences clarence x and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets clarence x also instructed his followers to try to prevent violence and looting he was commended by the citys leadership for his efforts and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of five percenter teachings and portions of the quran willieen jowers recalled that clarence x admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time he later described himself as neither antiwhite nor problack and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings his white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in harlem during the february  noreaster he was accepted as a five percenter as clarence x maintained that civilization—rather than race—was valued by the group clarence x made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed contrary to his radical reputation he endorsed some conservative positions in the late s including capital punishment respect for the us flag and american involvement in vietnam he also allowed his supporters to attend christmas celebrations knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement clarence x was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young five percenters and won some concessions from the institutions leadership some secular black leaders disliked him owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric on one occasion he was invited to address an audience of black marxists then spoke to them about numerology around  clarence x fathered a son with a young convert named gusavia that year gloria steinem published an article about clarence x in new york magazine she blamed the noi for the previous attempt to kill him arguing that they were angered by his claim to be allah and thus above elijah muhammad clarence x also received coverage from international media including a canadian television program deathedit by  clarence x became very tired and slept little he feared that he would be killed and instructed his followers to remain strong if he died on june  he spent time with several of his disciples at their school he left the school between  and  am on june  and then gambled for an hour or two as was his occasional practice he traveled to dora smiths house to rest he was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him while he was in the lobby of her apartment building that morning several people from the mayors office met with his family and the mayor later visited the five percenters school to express condolences clarence xs funeral was held four days after his death it was attended by about  people and was followed by a procession through harlem his death put the leadership of his movement in question—there was no clear successor at that time his followers were primarily teenagers and several of his top leaders subsequently struggled with drug addiction most local media sources gave clarence x positive coverage in the wake of his death the daily news connected his murder with the recent death of noi activist charles kenyatta casting them as part of a muslim war the mayor believed that the nypd told them this and was angered by their claim louis farrakhan denied culpability maintaining that he had good relations with clarence x nypd investigators suspected that he was killed by members of an extortion ring possibly connected to the fair play for cuba committee in august  an arrest was made in connection with his murder the suspect denied involvement and charges were soon dropped five percenters have posited different culprits including the cia the noi or a disgruntled follower legacy and receptionedit five percenter membership plunged after clarence xs death but rebounded in  after new leadership emerged and revitalized the group after his death the group was not dominated by a single leader this may have been a result of their teaching that all black men are gods which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable knight doubts that clarence x set out to build a movement or a culture but after his death the movement expanded and gained converts across the united states five percenters have celebrated clarence xs birthday as a holiday and minimized the descriptions of his flaws in their accounts of his life numerous apocryphal stories from his life have circulated among the group some accounts have claimed that he gambled only as a means to reach others with his teachings he did not leave behind a record of his teachings and the group had few formalized tenets at the time of his death in the following decades the groups doctrine became more complicated akbar muhammad of the noi described clarence x as confused although relations between the five percenters and noi leaders have improved over time clarence xs teachings may have influenced the doctrines of dwight york founder of the nuwaubian nation york saw clarence xs teachings as an insufficient incomplete path lawyer sidney davidoff one of lindsays assistants deemed clarence x a little bit snakeoil salesman and a little bit crazy but no more unstable than anyone else preaching a gospel on the street corner davidoff saw clarence xs black supremacist teachings as a way to instill confidence in young people knight states that clarence x went from a harlem rowdy to a legitimate community leader and lindsay later cast clarence xs role in the city as similar to that of al sharpton mattias gardell of uppsala university views clarence x as a gifted philosopher see alsoedit list of unsolved deaths notesedit  the x replaced his surname considered by the nation of islam to be a slave name and the  indicated that he was the thirteenth member
