statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern as shown in the accompanying financial statements the company has incurred losses of from operations of  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively and has an accumulated deficiency which raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern management believes the company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows if ever management plans to seek additional debt andor equity financing for the company but cannot assure that such financing will be available on accepted terms the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations and obtain additional financing as may be required our auditors have included a going concern qualification in their auditors report dated april   such a going concern qualification may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed the outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured  the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this

market risk not applicable for a smaller reporting company  item   controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the securities exchange act of  as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september    based on the existence of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting discussed in our form k for the year ended december   our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september   to provide such reasonable assurances we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud  disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met  further the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs  because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud if any  the design of disclosure controls and procedures is also based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions remediation plan for material weaknesses at such time that it is economically feasible we will aggressively recruit experienced professionals to ensure that we can maintain adequate segregation of duties and be able to ensure that all necessary disclosures are reported in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  although we believe that this corrective step will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is hired and trained we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient  we may be required to expend additional resources to identify assess and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control  changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended september   there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in

disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under rule ae and rule de promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended as of december    we do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions which is a basic internal control  due to our size and nature segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible  however to the extent possible the initiation of transactions the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals  based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures to be not effective as of december   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  our internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer or the persons performing similar functions to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these officers have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control over financial reporting  guidance for smaller public companies our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   and concluded that it was not effective because of the material weakness described below  due to resource constraints material weaknesses continue to be evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the necessary disclosure for inclusion in our filings with the securities and exchange commission due to the lack of resources and segregation of duties  a material weakness is a significant deficiency in one or more of the internal control components that alone or in the aggregate precludes our internal controls from reducing to an appropriately low level the risk that material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting  managements report was not subject to attestation by the registrants registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit the registrant to provide only managements report in this annual report evaluation of changes in internal control over financial reporting our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended december    based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer or those persons performing similar functions did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting remediation plan for material weaknesses at such time that it is economically feasible we will aggressively recruit experienced professionals to ensure that we maintain adequate segregation of duties and have controls in place to ensure proper disclosures are in our filings with the securities and exchange commission although we believe that these corrective steps will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is trained we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient we may be required to expend additional resources to identify assess and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control important considerations the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations including cost limitations judgments used in decision making assumptions about the likelihood of future events the soundness of our systems the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud moreover projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time because of these limitations there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal
