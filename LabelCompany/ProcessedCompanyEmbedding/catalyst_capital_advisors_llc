against them over the last few weeks but the trading was too little to move the market according to jerry szilagyi chief executive officer and cofounder of catalyst desks have been rife with speculation that forced buying by catalyst contributed to the market’s buoyancy in recent sessions“our exposure was greatly exaggerated and our impact on the market was greatly exaggerated” said szilagyi by phone “comments that we were forced to short cover are not correct we haven’t been forced to do anything” the most important market news of the day get our markets daily newsletter sign up

this is the type of environment that’s the worst for the fund” said szilagyi “we’ve had losses before and when this happens we’ve covered our positions and when market conditions are more favorable we’ll get back in”though drawdowns recently have been more than in the past szilagyi maintains that otherwise everything is business as usual he added that a normal risk management program kicking in
