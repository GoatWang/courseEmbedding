enterprise group greg meckbach compdealernews published december th  in the six months since bell canada bought infostream technologies inc isabelle courville’s team has been busy working on a storagearea networking service that combines the expertise of both companies courville president of bell canada’s enterprise group is tightlipped about the specifics of the san offering which is currently undergoing customer trials and scheduled for final release next year she will only say it combines bell’s history in telecommunications with the storage experience of staff at richmond hill ontbased infostream solution providers will be interested to note that infostream which provides storage voice over ip and other networking integration services still carries its own brand “”we’re trying to respect the separate business models but at the same time we’re trying to work together better”” courville said she added that thanks to bell’s national sales force and its contacts in large organizations it has been able to ink much larger deals than before took over groupcourville who has worked on and off at bell since the early s took over the enterprise group when it was formed in june  before that she was president and ceo of bell nordiq group inc a carrier that serves northern ontario and quebec and was formed from the merger of telebec and northerntel in  as president of the enterprise group one of her main focus areas is developing products that use the network to make customers more competitive last june for example bell launched its managed internet protocol ip telephony service which includes pointtopoint video findmefollowme and instant messaging services as of october bell canada customers were using a combined total of  ip voice lines solutions for brokerages the enterprise group also offers the institutional trade management solutions itms which lets large investors and brokerages connect their stock and bond trading systems over an ip network itms is touted as a service that will allow up to  trades per second to be executed electronically other applications driving demand for ip networks are call centre and customer relationship management to take advantage of that opportunity bell canada acquired a majority interest last april in montrealbased elix a professional services firm that installs ip telephony speech interactive voice response computer telephony integration and workforce management technologies the company has joined courville’s group to add to its corporate offerings “”what we’re seeing more and more is customers need an integrated management of all the infrastructure aspects of their call centre so beyond selecting the people and managing the people they want all the rest to be taken care of by trusted providers”” she said “”they want to have their call centre performing at the best possible level and they need external help to get to that level”” the carrier also acquired charon systems inc this year a professional services firm whose offerings include serverbased computing design of local and widearea networks security and monitoring however it was moved into bell’s small and medium business group different approach with these deals bell is getting into the same space as some systems integrators but the approach courville said is generally different “”the si will come at it in a very customized way often looking at the issue of a customers building specific solutions that are highly customized”” she said “”we come at it with our telco background which is very productbased so we will go at things    that use a lot of networks — we call it more business networking solutions”” bell canada’s enterprise unit is evolving from a telecommunications firm to an information and communications technologies ict firm she said “”with sis moving into connectivity and telcos moving into it we’re just more players in the same overall marketplace”” she said “”there’s still a lot of differentiation because of our background with bell enterprise we would look at what customer needs are multisite issues productivity needs and involve in any way shape or form the use of a network””
