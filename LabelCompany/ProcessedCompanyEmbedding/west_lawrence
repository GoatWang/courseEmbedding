trail followed the kansas river through what would become lawrence and mount oread originally referred to as hogback ridge was used as a landmark and an outlook soon after it was announced that territory would be opened up to settling pro and antislavery elements flooded the state in the hopes that once kansas became a state they could either vote slavery up or down according to rev richard cordley the most systematic and extensive movement to colonize kansas however was made in new england the new england emigrant aid company which had been chartered by the legislature of massachusetts in april was then called the massachusetts emigrant aid society but afterwards a new charter was obtained for the new england emigrant aid company the men engaged in it eli thayer amos a lawrence and others began their work at once arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to kansas as early as june  they sent dr charles robinson of fitchburg and mr charles h branscomb of holyoke to explore the territory and select a site for a colony  previously dr robinson had journey to kansas during which his party climbed the hill along this spur and looked off over what was afterwards the site of lawrence they marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known but when the time came to select a location for the first colony dr robinson remembered this view from the hilltop and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision when he was asked therefore to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies it was not altogether an unknown land to him after considering various locations in kansas branscomb and robinson eventually settled on the area around mt oread while branscomb and robinson were exploring the new england emigrant aid company was busy assembling a pioneer party of twentynine men with which they would use to found their city on july   this group departed boston according to cordley immense crowds had gathered at the station to give them a parting godspeed they moved out of the station amid the cheering of the crowds who lined the track for several blocks in late july the group met robinson in st lous who told them all he knew and provided them with transportation the group arrived in the future location of lawrence on august  of that year and they ate their first meal on mt oread itself another party made up of sixtyseven settlers left boston on august  reaching their destination a little over a week later on september  by october of  the settlers began debating as to what their community should be named when the settlers first arrived most referred to it as wakarusa but other names like yankee town new boston and plymouth were considered eventually it was agreed to call the town lawrence city in honor or amos adams lawrence an abolitionist who according to cordley was one of the first men of means to fund the emigrant aid company lawrence was also chosen as a name because it sounded well and had no bad odor attached to it in any part of the union the main street of the town was named massachusetts to commemorate the origins of the pioneer party the first post office in lawrence was established in january  plymouth congregational church in lawrence was the first church established in kansas

touted the free state mission which caused problems with the proslavery people in the region the kansas free state began in early january  things finally boiled over on november   when the proslavery settler franklin coleman shot and killed the free stater charles dow at hickory point about fourteen miles south of lawrence because of a land claim douglas county sheriff samuel l jones arrested dows affiliate jacob branson but the latter man was eventually rescued by freestaters which caused the proslavery faction to seethe with anger within a matter of days the governor of the kansas territory wilson shannon called for the kansas militia to settle the issue but this resulted in a small army of  missourians entering kansas prepared to attack lawrence the citizens of lawrence bracing for the attack raised up a militia of  men in response dr charles robinson was commanderinchief of the citys troops and the future state senator james lane was second in command the citizens of lawrence were also aided by the abolitionist john brown and his sons however the missourians never attacked and robinson and lane along with the missourians were encouraged by shannon to sign a peace treaty such an agreement was finally made in december of  and after this the missouri army reluctantly left the area ruins of free state hotel after the attack in  harassment by sheriff jones and other southern sympathizers continued unabated eventually the kansas free state the herald of freedom and the free state hotel the latter of which was owned and operated by the new england emigrant aid company were all indicted as nuisances by proslavery forces on april   sheriff jones was shot while trying to arrest freestate settlers this once again resulted in a major pushback from the proslavery factions in the area and on may  sheriff jones and a posse of southern sympathizers sacked lawrence dr robinson’s house on mount oread was taken by the federal marshal as headquarters and the newspaper printing presses were damaged and thrown in the river the free state hotel was also destroyed in  lawrence began to eclipse lecompton the territorial capital of kansas in importance and soon it became the

county was part of the shawnee indian reservation the oregon trail followed the kansas river through what would become lawrence and mount oread originally referred to as hogback ridge was used as a landmark and an outlook soon after it was announced that territory would be opened up to settling pro and antislavery elements flooded the state in the hopes that once kansas became a state they could either vote slavery up or down according to rev richard cordley the most systematic and extensive movement to colonize kansas however was made in new england the new england emigrant aid company which had been chartered by the legislature of massachusetts in april was then called the massachusetts emigrant aid society but afterwards a new charter was obtained for the new england emigrant aid company the men engaged in it eli thayer amos a lawrence and others began their work at once arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to kansas as early as june  they sent dr charles robinson of fitchburg and mr charles h branscomb of holyoke to explore the territory and select a site for a colony  previously dr robinson had journey to kansas during which his party climbed the hill along this spur and looked off over what was afterwards the site of lawrence they marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known but when the time came to select a location for the first colony dr robinson remembered this view from the hilltop and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision when he was asked therefore to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies it was not altogether an unknown land to him after considering various locations in kansas branscomb and robinson eventually settled on the area around mt oread while branscomb and robinson were exploring the new england emigrant aid company was busy assembling a pioneer party of twentynine men with which they would use to found their city on july   this group departed boston according to cordley immense crowds had gathered at the station to give them a parting godspeed they moved out of the station amid the cheering of the crowds who lined the track for several blocks in late july the group met robinson in st lous who told them all he knew and provided them with transportation the group arrived in the future location of lawrence on august  of that year and they ate their first meal on mt oread itself another party made up of sixtyseven settlers left boston on august  reaching their destination a little over a week later on september  by october of  the settlers began debating as to what their community should be named when the settlers first arrived most referred to it as wakarusa but other names like yankee town new boston and plymouth were considered eventually it was agreed to call the town lawrence city in honor or amos adams lawrence an abolitionist who according to cordley was one of the first men of means to fund the emigrant aid company lawrence was also chosen as a name because it sounded well and had no bad odor attached to it in any part of the union the main street of the town was named massachusetts to commemorate the origins of the pioneer party the first post office in lawrence was established in january  plymouth congregational church in lawrence was the first church established in kansas territory in march  the quincy school was started in the emigrant aid office before moving to the basement of the unitarian church in april the plymouth

kansas pioneer and the herald of freedom both touted the free state mission which caused problems with the proslavery people in the region the kansas free state began in early january  things finally boiled over on november   when the proslavery settler franklin coleman shot and killed the free stater charles dow at hickory point about fourteen miles south of lawrence because of a land claim douglas county sheriff samuel l jones arrested dows affiliate jacob branson but the latter man was eventually rescued by freestaters which caused the proslavery faction to seethe with anger within a matter of days the governor of the kansas territory wilson shannon called for the kansas militia to settle the issue but this resulted in a small army of  missourians entering kansas prepared to attack lawrence the citizens of lawrence bracing for the attack raised up a militia of  men in response dr charles robinson was commanderinchief of the citys troops and the future state senator james lane was second in command the citizens of lawrence were also aided by the abolitionist john brown and his sons however the missourians never attacked and robinson and lane along with the missourians were encouraged by shannon to sign a peace treaty such an agreement was finally made in december of  and after this the missouri army reluctantly left the area ruins of free state hotel after the attack in  harassment by sheriff jones and other southern sympathizers continued unabated eventually the kansas free state the herald of freedom and the free state hotel the latter of which was owned and operated by the new england emigrant aid company were all indicted as nuisances by proslavery forces on april   sheriff jones was shot while trying to arrest freestate settlers this once again resulted in a major pushback from the proslavery factions in the area and on may  sheriff jones and a posse of southern sympathizers sacked lawrence dr robinson’s house on mount oread was taken by the federal marshal as headquarters and the newspaper printing presses were damaged and thrown in the river the free state hotel was also destroyed in  lawrence began to eclipse lecompton the territorial

prior to kansas territory being opened to settlement in may  most of douglas county was part of the shawnee indian reservation the oregon trail followed the kansas river through what would become lawrence and mount oread originally referred to as hogback ridge was used as a landmark and an outlook soon after it was announced that territory would be opened up to settling pro and antislavery elements flooded the state in the hopes that once kansas became a state they could either vote slavery up or down according to rev richard cordley the most systematic and extensive movement to colonize kansas however was made in new england the new england emigrant aid company which had been chartered by the legislature of massachusetts in april was then called the massachusetts emigrant aid society but afterwards a new charter was obtained for the new england emigrant aid company the men engaged in it eli thayer amos a lawrence and others began their work at once arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to kansas as early as june  they sent dr charles robinson of fitchburg and mr charles h branscomb of holyoke to explore the territory and select a site for a colony  previously dr robinson had journey to kansas during which his party climbed the hill along this spur and looked off over what was afterwards the site of lawrence they marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known but when the time came to select a location for the first colony dr robinson remembered this view from the hilltop and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision when he was asked therefore to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies it was not altogether an unknown land to him after considering various locations in kansas branscomb and robinson eventually settled on the area around mt oread while branscomb and robinson were exploring the new england emigrant aid company was busy assembling a pioneer party of twentynine men with which they would use to found their city on july   this group departed boston according to cordley immense crowds had gathered at the station to give them a parting godspeed they moved out of the station amid the cheering of the crowds who lined the track for several blocks in late july the group met robinson in st lous who told them all he knew and provided them with transportation the group arrived in the future location of lawrence on august  of that year and they ate their first meal on mt oread itself another party made up of sixtyseven settlers left boston on august  reaching their destination a little over a week later on september  by october of  the settlers began debating as to what their community should be named when the settlers first arrived most referred to it as wakarusa but other names like yankee town new boston and plymouth were considered eventually it was agreed to call the town lawrence city in honor or amos adams lawrence an abolitionist who according to cordley was one of the first men of means to fund the emigrant aid company lawrence was also chosen as a name because it sounded well and had no bad odor attached to it in any part of the union the main street of the town was named massachusetts to commemorate the origins of the pioneer party the first post office in lawrence was established in january  plymouth congregational church in lawrence was the first church established in kansas territory in march  the quincy school was started in the

the proslavery people in the region the kansas free state began in early january  things finally boiled over on november   when the proslavery settler franklin coleman shot and killed the free stater charles dow at hickory point about fourteen miles south of lawrence because of a land claim douglas county sheriff samuel l jones arrested dows affiliate jacob branson but the latter man was eventually rescued by freestaters which caused the proslavery faction to seethe with anger within a matter of days the governor of the kansas territory wilson shannon called for the kansas militia to settle the issue but this resulted in a small army of  missourians entering kansas prepared to attack lawrence the citizens of lawrence bracing for the attack raised up a militia of  men in response dr charles robinson was commanderinchief of the citys troops and the future state senator james lane was second in command the citizens of lawrence were also aided by the abolitionist john brown and his sons however the missourians never attacked and robinson and lane along with the missourians were encouraged by shannon to sign a peace treaty such an agreement was finally made in december of  and after this the missouri army reluctantly left the area ruins of free state hotel after the attack in  harassment by sheriff jones and other southern sympathizers continued unabated eventually the kansas free state the herald of freedom and the free state hotel the latter of which was owned and operated by the new england emigrant aid company were all indicted as nuisances by proslavery forces on april   sheriff jones was shot while trying to arrest freestate settlers this once again resulted in a major pushback from the proslavery factions in the area and on may  sheriff jones and a posse of southern sympathizers sacked lawrence dr robinson’s house on mount oread was taken by the federal marshal as headquarters and the newspaper printing presses were damaged and thrown in the river the

territory would be opened up to settling pro and antislavery elements flooded the state in the hopes that once kansas became a state they could either vote slavery up or down according to rev richard cordley the most systematic and extensive movement to colonize kansas however was made in new england the new england emigrant aid company which had been chartered by the legislature of massachusetts in april was then called the massachusetts emigrant aid society but afterwards a new charter was obtained for the new england emigrant aid company the men engaged in it eli thayer amos a lawrence and others began their work at once arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to kansas as early as june  they sent dr charles robinson of fitchburg and mr charles h branscomb of holyoke to explore the territory and select a site for a colony  previously dr robinson had journey to kansas during which his party climbed the hill along this spur and looked off over what was afterwards the site of lawrence they marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known but when the time came to select a location for the first colony dr robinson remembered this view from the hilltop and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision when he was asked therefore to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies it was not altogether an unknown land to him after considering various locations in kansas branscomb and robinson eventually settled on the area around mt

plymouth were considered eventually it was agreed to call the town lawrence city in honor or amos adams lawrence an abolitionist who according to cordley was one of the first men of means to fund the

county was part of the shawnee indian reservation the oregon trail followed the kansas river through what would become lawrence and mount oread originally referred to as hogback ridge was used as a landmark and an outlook soon after it was announced that territory would be opened up to settling pro and antislavery elements flooded the state in the hopes that once kansas became a state they could either vote slavery up or down according to rev richard cordley the most systematic and extensive movement to colonize kansas however was made in new england the new england emigrant aid company which had been chartered by the legislature of massachusetts in april was then called the massachusetts emigrant aid society but afterwards a new charter was obtained for the new england emigrant aid company the men engaged in it eli thayer amos a lawrence and others began their work at once arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to kansas as early as june  they sent dr charles robinson of fitchburg and mr charles h branscomb of holyoke to explore the territory and select a site for a colony  previously dr robinson had journey to kansas during which his party climbed the hill along this spur and looked off over what was afterwards the site of lawrence they marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known but when the time came to select a location for the first colony dr robinson remembered this view from the hilltop and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision when he was asked therefore to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies it was not altogether an unknown land to him after considering various locations in kansas branscomb and robinson eventually settled on the area around mt oread while branscomb and robinson were exploring the new england emigrant aid company was busy assembling a pioneer party of twentynine men with which they would use to found their city on july   this group departed boston according to cordley immense crowds had gathered at the station to give them a parting godspeed they moved out of the station amid the cheering of the crowds who lined the track for several blocks in late july the group met robinson in st lous who told them all he knew and provided them with transportation the group arrived in the future location of lawrence on august  of that year and they ate their first meal on mt oread itself another party made up of sixtyseven settlers left boston on august  reaching their destination a little over a week later on september  by october of  the settlers began debating as to what their community should be named when the settlers first arrived most referred to it as wakarusa but other names like yankee town new boston and plymouth were considered eventually it was agreed to call the town lawrence city in honor or amos adams lawrence an abolitionist who according to cordley was one of the first men of means to fund the emigrant aid company lawrence was also chosen as a name because it sounded well and had no bad odor attached to it in any part of the union the main street of the town was named massachusetts to commemorate the origins of the pioneer party the first post office in lawrence was established in january  plymouth congregational church in lawrence was the first church established in kansas territory in march  the quincy school was started in the emigrant aid office before moving to the basement of the unitarian church in april the plymouth

kansas pioneer and the herald of freedom both touted the free state mission which caused problems with the proslavery people in the region the kansas free state began in early january  things finally boiled over on november   when the proslavery settler franklin coleman shot and killed the free stater charles dow at hickory point about fourteen miles south of lawrence because of a land claim douglas county sheriff samuel l jones arrested dows affiliate jacob branson but the latter man was eventually rescued by freestaters which caused the proslavery faction to seethe with anger within a matter of days the governor of the kansas territory wilson shannon called for the kansas militia to settle the issue but this resulted in a small army of  missourians entering kansas prepared to attack lawrence the citizens of lawrence bracing for the attack raised up a militia of  men in response dr charles robinson was commanderinchief of the citys troops and the future state senator james lane was second in command the citizens of lawrence were also aided by the abolitionist john brown and his sons however the missourians never attacked and robinson and lane along with the missourians were encouraged by shannon to sign a peace treaty such an agreement was finally made in december of  and after this the missouri army reluctantly left the area ruins of free state hotel after the attack in  harassment by sheriff jones and other southern sympathizers continued unabated eventually the kansas free state the herald of freedom and the free state hotel the latter of which was owned and operated by the new england emigrant aid company were all indicted as nuisances by proslavery forces on april   sheriff jones was shot while trying to arrest freestate settlers this once again resulted in a major pushback from the proslavery factions in the area and on may  sheriff jones and a posse of southern sympathizers sacked lawrence dr robinson’s house on mount oread was taken by the federal marshal as headquarters and the newspaper printing presses were damaged and thrown in the river the free state hotel was also destroyed in  lawrence began to eclipse lecompton the territorial

general merchandisestore tour west lawrence hyvee slideshowa highenergy clientele meets an energyefficient store designby steve dwyer csp reporter july   what follows is an expanded version of the feature story “energy squared” which ran in the may issue of convenience store products magazine west lawrence kan  college students are often noted for at least two qualities social consciousness and boundless energy enter the new clinton parkway hyvee cstore in west lawrence kan which has an inside track on both the store located near the student university of kansas opened last october with strong credentials it’s a gold leed leadership in energy and environmental designcertified facility the pinnacle of green and sustainable building construction and a standard not lost on the college student customer base “hyvee has designed some other leedcertified supermarkets but we wanted to test a cstore prototype and lawrence fit the bill” says andrew yochum retail director of the squarefoot store with  fueling stations “lawrence is a major university town that tends to lean to the left and a lot of students care about the environment” taking about six months to build in  the facility strikes an impressive pose with cantilevered solar panels atop gasoline canopies which take full advantage of natural sunlight a rooftop rain collection system stores water that operates toilets while concrete floors don’t require wax or other chemicals for cleaning sensordriven led lightemitting diode lighting and skylights help conserve energy an energyefficient hvac system enabled hyvee to avoid investing in a more expensive geothermal system for heating and cooling landscaping beds use native plants requiring very little watering while a lawn featuring buffalo grass uses so little water that the store did away with building an irrigation system economies of scale there’s no doubt the store has compelling curb appeal but the environmental and energyefficient qualities just set the tone for what’s inside a merchandising plan that caters closely to the desires of the customer demographic and leans on the company’s supermarkets for procurement and product mix “the thing i love about doing business in this town is i get to control what i carry how i carry it when and where in the store i carry it” says yochum who has worked on both the cstore and supermarket side of business for west des moines iowabased hyvee since  hyvee has more than  grocery stores in eight states “having the supermarket affiliation is a tremendous advantage because we can tailor the business totally to the community if my customers want something i can easily make it available” located about a mile from a hyvee grocery store the cstore has the latitude to “buy a truckload of gatorade and take advantage of the economies of scale if product doesn’t sell the risk is low we trade things back and forth all the time” says yochum thanks to the hyvee brand name the cstore pushes with regularity grocerysize offerings such as gallons of milk creamers eggs and orange juice plus barbecue items for grilling including charcoal and lighter fluid “we also do very well with general merchandise items like otc drug products cold remedy toothpaste and other things college students need” yochum says for everyone from college students to construction workers to busy young mothers heading off to the gym “energy” is the buzzword an ample stock of energy shots and energy drinks an upscale caribou coffee program and a popular fountain island with unique flavors all serve as product pillars pages  next ›

afterwards occur is not known but when the time came to select a location for the first colony dr robinson remembered this view from the hilltop and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision
