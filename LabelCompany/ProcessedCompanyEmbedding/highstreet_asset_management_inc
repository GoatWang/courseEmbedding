provide superior absolute performance over the long term their objective is to offer investments that provide relatively low correlation to traditional and alternative investments and that provide relatively low correlation to each other their strategies include longshort equity convertible and fixedincome arbitrage merger arbitrage event driven or special situations opportunistic systematic distressed securities capital structure arbitrage and multistrategysalidas longshort equity strategy starts with a macro view on their desired net market exposure net long net short or market neutral bottom up fundamental research drives their stock selection process they seek to identify securities that are mispriced either overvalued or undervalued based on the firms outlook for that particular industry or sector they also look for a catalyst that changes the outlook for that security within a certain time frame positions sizes are based on an assessment of the ratio of risk to potential reward they examine relative pricing within sectors as well as correlations across sectors to assess risk and to identify opportunities to hedge their long or short investments salida mitigates risk or hedge exposure through short sales of stocks or etfs as well as positions in relevant commodity futures or indicessalidas convertible and fixedincome arbitrage strategy begins with a constant screening of the convertible bond and corporate bond universe to identify securities that are mispriced or undervalued relative to their underlying equities the process involves examining company and industry fundamentals the number of shares sold short depends on the desired market exposure and is determined by yield curve shifts dividend yields as well as the pricing and volatility of the stockthe firms merger arbitrage strategy relies on fundamental stock selection salida analyzes public documents analyst reports and conversations with company officials if the rewards outweigh the risks they may take a position which they may add to if the outcome becomes more certain they will liquidate the position if the riskreward relationship deteriorates or if the deal is consummatedsalidas event driven or special situations strategy looks for opportunities driven by catalyst events or special situations including mergers hostile takeovers reorganizations or lbos they are particularly interested in event driven situations where they may have a competitive advantage due to their fundamental background or research in one of the firms core industriestheir opportunistic strategy seeks to take advantage of investment opportunities that arise from events such as ipos sudden price changes caused by events such as an interim earnings disappointment a news release that impacts the market hostile bids or market disruptions caused by large blocks or other trading anomaliessalidas systematic strategy seeks returns from a variety of liquid global markets including currency fixedincome equity energy agricultural and metals markets both trend following and counter trend strategies are usedtheir distressed securities strategy involves a long or short investment in equity andor debt that is deemed overvalued or undervalued they focus on companies that are in or near bankruptcy or whose securities are trading as if bankruptcy is probable they employ fundamental analysis including credit recovery analysis to determine the expected future value of the securities these investments may involve the purchase of the senior bonds of a bankrupt company with the anticipation of either owning a package of post bankruptcy newco debt andor equity and warrants such that the expected return on capital employed is sufficient distressed securities may be sold short when a companys securities are thought to be overvalued and the risk adjusted expected return on capital from being short is attractivetheir capital structure arbitrage strategy employs a varied approach that includes fundamental credit prospectusindenture and trading flows analyses the process involves the purchase of the layer or layers of the capital structure that is relatively undervalued and to simultaneously sell short those securities that relatively overvalued the ratio of the hedged portion of the investment is determined using scenario analysis and the resulting expected returns for each security being analyzed to determine the optimal hedge they consider all parts of the capital structure including loans senior debt subordinated debt secured debt convertible debt preferred shares equity warrants as well as other related derivative securitiessalidas multistrategy approach is a blend of all their other strategies the approach is diversified by employing various strategies simultaneously to realize short and long term gains they seek to overweight or underweight different strategies to capitalize on current investment opportunities other affiliations
