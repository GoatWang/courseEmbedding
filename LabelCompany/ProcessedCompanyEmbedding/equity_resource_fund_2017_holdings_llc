names to the riverfront dynamic equity fund the riverfront moderate growth fund changed names to the riverfront global allocation fund the performance of the fund relative to its benchmark will depend largely on the decisions of the riverfront investment group llc the subadviser or riverfront as to strategic asset allocation and tactical adjustments made to the asset allocation at times riverfronts judgments as to the asset classes in which the fund should invest may prove to be wrong as some asset classes may perform worse than others or the equity markets generally from time to time or for extended periods of time the performance of the fund is related to the economic sectors that riverfront may choose to emphasize or deemphasize from time to time as well as to the individual securities selected by riverfront within those sectors the investment returns for particular economic sectors will fluctuate and may be lower than other sectors in addition the individual securities chosen for investment within a particular sector may underperform other securities within that same sector certain stocks selected for the funds portfolio may decline in value more than the overall stock markets

 of your portfolio in these sectors foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure as well as economic and political risk by investing in a specific geographic region a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio the emerging europe fund invests more than  of its

the effects of sales charges loads and redemption fees placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next
