terrible splendor becomes as engrossing as the contest it portrays…cramm’s life is a movie development deal waiting to happen”—washington post“richly detailed…the story moves from one nailbiting set to the next against a backdrop of improbably high personal and political stakes”—boston globe“vivid…the compelling nature of the match in tennis terms alone would be enough to make this a gripping read…but tennis is almost the least interesting element of fisher’s account for the historic match between the two players took place in london with the world poised for brutal war and the players bringing all manger of psychological baggage on court with them…fisher shows how sport can stand both outside the ‘real world’ and yet remain subject to its dark whims”—financial times“exciting…a thoroughly riveting account of an intense human endeavor…the astonishing inspiring story of a sports hero who was not merely a heroic tennis player but a genuinely heroic man”—the commercial dispatchmarshall jon fisher has masterfully woven the story of europe on the edge of war a man pursued by the gestapo and america on the rise into the tale of the greatest tennis match of the century

versus nadal and borg versus mcenroe marshall jon fisher convincingly demonstrates that the greatest tennis match of all time was gottried von cramm versus don budge in the  davis cup semifinals this is one of the best sports books you will ever read but it’s more than a sports book as absorbing as the drama unfolding on wimbledon’s centre court is it’s surpassed by the drama of history swirling outside it fisher masterfully weaves biography history and sports–and sex and romance and the drums of war–into a thoroughly riveting narrative full of ironic twists and astonishing revelations a terrible splendor is a literary triumph—scott stossel deputy editor atlantic monthly“marshall jon fisher has turned a tennis court masterpiece — american don budge versus german gottfried von cramm to decide the  davis cup — into a literary masterpiece   blending their lives with the darkening times fisher illuminates bygone cultures in the fascinating tale of a july afternoon in london” —bud collins writer for the boston globe and commentator for espn and tennis channel“there could be no more disparate characters in any sport than bib bill tilden don budge and baron gottfried von cramm marshall jon fisher has done a marvelous job of weaving the threads of these three lives together at a time when the world was coming apart and at the moment when budge and von cramm were playing in the most important — if not the best — tennis match ever this is sports history at its finest and most thorough”—frank deford senior contributing writer sports illustrated and commentator on npr’s “morning edition”“through the prism of one of the greatest tennis matches ever played marshall jon fisher throws open a window on the terrifying world of the thirties in europe illuminating in vivid detail the persecution of baron gottfried von cramm the pitiful kowtowing to hitler by the tennis authorities and rising above it all the innate sportsmanship of the two friends and rivals von cramm
