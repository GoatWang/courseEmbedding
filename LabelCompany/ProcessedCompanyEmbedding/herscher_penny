goals that are tough but can be achieved credit earl wilsonthe new york times this interview with penny herscher the chief executive of firstrain a business analytics firm was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq tell me about your parentsa my parents were both engineers and mathematicians my mother was actually the second woman to ever major in engineering at oxford so i was raised in an environment where anybody who was anybody did math and the expectation was that i would go into technology because that’s where all the excitement wasso you had a clear idea what you wanted to do in collegei studied math at cambridge and i thought i was going to be in technical roles my whole life i worked for a year in england as a computer programmer and then my husband and i got on a plane and came to california we had no health insurance and no money but we were confident we could get jobsi did get a programming job but after a couple of years i wasn’t terribly happy being a software engineer because so much time is spent in front of a screen and i’m an extrovert i got discovered by the sales and marketing people in the company because i was good at doing product demonstrations and they recruited me to the business side of the house i’ve never looked back continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story what were some early lessons you learned as a manager i have a strong personality and early on i definitely didn’t know how to let other people blossom and thrive i was sure i was right all the time and i was probably bossy and autocratic i learned that the hard way i had people who didn’t want to work for me — some of them told me and some of them just lefteven so the company’s leadership above me appreciated what i was doing so i had to learn this balance between being a strong personality that could solve a hard problem while creating enough air and light for the people who worked for me that took some time to learnhow else did your leadership style evolvea huge lesson for me was having kids i was the most important person in the universe until i had kids then you have children and suddenly you’re completely humbled and you’re not the most important personthat was very helpful for me as a leader and a manager i just evolved very quickly to realize that this was not all about me and i took those lessons and applied them to the workplace the things you learn raising a child are great skills for nurturing a team and bringing a project to life you take obstacles out of the way encourage them and set goals that are tough but can be achievedimportant mentors over the yearsi had a strong mentor for a long period he was the ceo of synopsys and then when i went to do a startup as ceo he was on that company’s board he was very candid with me along the way about what i was doing well and not doing well advertisement continue reading the main story he was one of the only people who would hold a mirror up to me and say “ok that wasn’t good” i needed somebody who would tell me the truth many leaders with strong personalities never hear the truth because their people are afraid to tell them the people who will

was the reality of being a ceo for the first time different than what you expectedi was  and i was completely unprepared i walked into the job thinking i knew how to be a ceo and after six months i realized i had no clue how to be a ceo i just kept finding myself in situations where i didn’t feel like i had the experience and the tool set to know what to do and i kept waiting for permissionone of the best pieces of advice i ever got in my career was from one of my board members who said to me “look you’re looking to the board for permission and you need to understand that we’re going to give you advice but you have to make your own decision because if we give you bad advice and you follow it we’ll still fire you so you are it you have to make the decisions you can collect advice but nobody is going to make a decision for you so just get on with it and make the decisions if they’re right you’ll be fine and if they’re wrong you’ll be fired”it was very clarifying for me to realize “ok this is it the buck really does stop here” that was a huge inflection point for me i just had to grow up all at once as ceo you cannot blame anybody else you own ithow do you hire i look for iq integrity and energy because you can’t teach those you’ve got to have the iq and you can often read integrity in the meeting and then you’ve got to have the energy for the jobi’ll ask questions about their career but then i’ll say “so what makes you really special if you were writing  words about yourself what would you say” you also learn an enormous amount by the questions they ask and the first two or three questions are what they really care about “tell me about your culture” and “how do you grow your employees” are great questionshow would you answer the question about what makes you speciali’m really driven once i set my eyes on a goal it might take me nine years to reach it but i’ll keep going after that goalanother ceo i interviewed likes to ask people “what’s your natural strength” how would you answer thatpublic speaking i did two years of competitive public speaking in high school if you can do it it’s a very powerful skill in business even if you’re scared to speak

travelsgrassy road →     the grassy road skip to main  skip to sidebar the grassy road a ceo at work and play in silicon valley and beyond thursday july    reasons its critical to truly understand your pl in the last month i have had the experience of three small business leaders talking to me about their pl in momentintime terms something like this for this quarter or this year well make x we spend y less than i thought so were z ahead usually followed by why x and z are so great and how theyll spend those extra dollars they are ahead or why their company is successful as a result naive unless you have a steady business that has been the same for a while is not growing and is profitable the momentintime view of your business tells you very little it might make you feel good that your bottom line is black and not red or not as red as you thought it would be but all youre getting is the warm and fuzzies  no insight so five reasons its critical you truly understand your pl over time  to be able to answer what is your revenue costs profitloss and collections every quarter or month depending on the cadence of your business for the last year and the coming  years  cash cash is queen for a growing businesses of any size its the fuel for growth and the security for longevity so you need to see how cash flows every month for the foreseeable future unless you are selling products for cash in the local market every sale comes with a delay in collection sometimes its when the credit card vendor pays you for your product sometimes its  days later when your customers ap department pays you but there is typically a delay but you are paying your people anyway and maybe opening up new offices hiring etc ahead of being paid for your sales this means the collections line item in your pl is critically interesting what cash are you collecting every month and so what is your ending cash every month after your expenses you need to have this carefully modeled over the next  months and intimately understand it so that as your business fluctuates and changes you know what it will do to cash flow combine this with a need to always have at least  months of payroll in the bank and this will tell you how much risk you can afford to take with your business at any moment in time ive seen businesses where the ceo is telling himherself how great they are doing because of all kinds of positive indicators but the cash collections line is not changing over time its not growing you cant hide from cash flow and so its a great indicator of the true underlying health of the business are the dogs eating the dog food and more importantly are they paying for it  measuring your progress if your business is immature less than  years old then almost no matter what business plan you build for the next  months it will not be what you actually do something will change youll do better or worse or differently than you thought but having a  year outlook and then measuring yourself against it is how youll learn the nuances of the business and learn how to predict and measure the changes going through the discipline of putting an  quarter plan together together to present to your stakeholders and your management team forces you to think through what assumptions you are making about your business dont tell me you dont know enough to do this yet  if you take someone elses money or even hire other people to work for you then you are responsible and that means you need to put your assumptions down on paper and fold them into a pl model so you can measure your progress against your assumptions and course correct accordingly you cant correct your course if youre not on one and dont fall into the trap of comparing your business to last years business at the same time while an interesting statistic it tells you nothing except whether you are growing it does not tell you how you are doing against your plan and so how your top line and expenses are flowing into cash see   learning financial management noone comes out of the womb knowing how to manage a pl most students graduate college without ever learning how to read a pl and a balance sheet a crime i think so no one expects you to just know it if you are not a trained financial professional but you want to lead a business team or be a ceo then you need to learn it step  take a class step  learn on your own pl do the spreadsheets yourself until you understand the relationships between revenue and collections costs and margin yes youll need a cpa to do your books but when it comes to forecasting the next  years of your business there is no reason you should not be able to build a simple model yourself i despair of entrepreneurs who hand the financial modeling off to someone else and never really grasp the financial dynamics and dependencies of their business  valuing your business as i mentioned up front unless your business is mature and not growing then how it is doing at any single point in time does not tell you much about its true value except a low value such as x revenue or x profit if you want to establish and communicate the value of your business to for example a potential investor you need to tell a story over time last year and next  years at a minimum except with mature businesses that generate cash businesses are valued on their potential how much revenue and profit will the business generate in the future is it growing and so what does that mean for future cash flows should it be valued as a multiple of ltm last twelve months revenue or ntm profits building and deeply understanding your business next  years of growth and being able to present it in a believable way because you understand the dynamics so well is how you establish value with an investor or buyer   communicating with your employees your employees or partners are following you because they believe hopefully youre paying them a fair wage but they are probably with you because they believe in what you are trying to do even in a large company this can be true  people join a team because they believe in the mission so given they are following you you need to keep them updated on how the business is doing so they can both help you solve problems and celebrate with you when things go well i am a big believer in sharing the basic pl of your business with your leadership team at a minimum and with your employees once it stabilizes if they dont have a good understanding of the future of your pl how are you going to enable them to fully participate in the building of the business and how will you celebrate the wins with them if they dont know whether you are making the plans you set out or not i dont buy the argument that employees are not able to handle the numbers  that it will scare them yes you dont tell them you are running out of cash but if you are hiring college graduates you can at least share your top line plans with them and if they dont understand the basics of a pl you can teach them they will thank you for it and be much more vested in the end results of the business if you share progress with them i recently put together a  hour class on the basics of reading a pl for a friends business where most of the employees have liberal arts degrees and it was not only great fun for me and the employees but it gave them a starting point to understand the terrific progress the company they are working for is making bottom line  if you are leading a team with financial targets or are the ceo of your own venture you owe it to yourself to learn and truly understand your own business pl photo british museum email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest posted by penny herscher at  am  comments email this labels ceo entrepreneur financial management pl pl management raising money startups sunday july   the importance of being humble we’ve all met this person in our professional lives smart but selfabsorbed in love with their own success so far or with the selfimportance of their title or the size of their business or how attractive they are executives who are so used to everyone catering to their every need that they forget to be courteous vcs who are so used to entrepreneurs beating down their doors they forget to be kind or worse entrepreneurs with hubris who think because they have raised money they are already a success lawyers and bankers who have been making so much money for so long they think their time is more important than the people around them the behavior is irritating but why does it matter it’s not my place to moralize in the greater sense but in my experience the behavior does catch up with most people in their careers one way or another in the end unless you have fast runaway success or true genius very rare or are the zaphod beeblebrox you are going to need the people around you for you to succeed long term if you are arrogant it is hard to get your peers to want to work with you or for you weaker people will but the strong ones will move on and in the end you are only as good as your team people might stay with you while the money is good – attaching themselves to your coat tails – but when your companyresponsibility hits a bump in the road or they don’t need you they will leave you being selfabsorbed might not hurt you at work because you’re the man with the big harddriving job… but chances are you are hurting the people who love you with your selfabsorption yes i am speaking from personal experience here both as the one doing the hurting and the one being hurt and now observing professional friends who in their selfabsorption forget who they are hurting as a good friend and megacompany ceo once told me for the smart strong overachievers it helps to think about life as a threelegged stool and all three legs need to be stable for your life to be balanced the first leg is work how you get intellectual satisfaction and earn a living the second leg is fun family friends good times how you find pleasure and love the third leg is spirituality whatever that means to you how you remind yourself that this is a huge mysterious world and you are no matter how important you think you are just a small part of the grand scheme of things when the world is beating a path to your door the money is rolling in to you or your company and the people who want things from you reinforce how terrific you are… how do you keep the third leg planted firmly on the ground a shock might do it for you for a while a project fails you lose a customer you have a health scare maybe you lose your job but if you’ve done well in the past chances are you will do well again so how do you keep the humbling realization that you are not the center of the universe with you at the jordan river where christ was baptized and israeli and jordanian soldiers watch each other guns cocked me i find it in many ways through understanding history where the complex messy story of our world and our humanity puts my insignificance squarely in perspective or through nature by hiking into the beauty of the mountains or the desert where i am reminded just how small i am for some it is their god and faith for some it is volunteering to help other people in need what is it for you in my experience of powerful business leaders the truly great ones stay humble yes they have strong opinions and expect to be listened to but they also never forget who they are the great ones treat admins junior staff and vendors with respect they put time into their family they vacation with their friends they are far from the entitled theonewiththemosttoyswins culture they are the ones that people follow from company to company and remember with a smile for the rest of their lives how do you or i become one of them i think that along with all the professional skills and opportunities in the world it is critical to remember who you are truly in the grand scheme of things and stay humble written for a dear friend who tells me he is working on it email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest posted by penny herscher at  am  comments email this labels being humble career advice ceo entrepreneur humility leadership tuesday june   why what and really yet another surreal week of sexual harassment in silicon valley yet another scandal of sexual harassment is unfolding in silicon valley this week and after several nights lying awake angry thinking about the last  years and expressing my ongoing frustration to a group of friends over dinner i was asked by a friend to answer  questions  why this still happens  are we really surprised that it does  what does speaking up accomplish any more first to the news as has happened thousands of times before a venture capitalist justin calbeck of binary capital sexually harassed women entrepreneurs attempting to raise money from him but in an extraordinarily brave move  women spoke out and  spoke out by name the allegations were specific enough that despite an initial denial justin calbeck has now resigned and the firm no longer has strong support from its lps its days are numbered given that even the most egregious sexual predators dont want to be publicly outed by the women they hit on and we live in such a public online world why does this still happen the reason is the incredible imbalance of power that exists in the venture fundraising world most vcs are clean cut white men most have been very successful financially and they think it is because they are smart some truly are company founders old school vcs who have bankrolled winner after winner vcs who are true company builders but with the huge increase in capital coming into the venture market there are many vcs who got where they are by being in the right place at the right time they were just lucky to be at a company that did well they know the right people they talk a good game and next thing you know they are raising a small fund from lps who are desperate to find enough places to put their money and share in the phenomenon venture partners get paid a lot of money to administer a fund and entrepreneurs beat a path to their door to try to impress them the entrepreneurs struggle to get their deck looked at struggle to get a meeting work hard to make an impact and as a result many vcs develop a sense of hubris and superiority rude abrasive and blend that sense of superiority with sex and you get some men who think its ok to proposition young women who are raising money the extraordinary generation of wealth going on in silicon valley now and over the last  years will lead some people to behave badly behave badly to get access to that wealth uber being todays poster child and behave badly abusing their positions of power twas ever so when money is being made so why are we surprised i am not in fact i think in some ways the issue is worse and more pervasive now than it was  years ago the objectification of women in media see miss representation or httpsseejaneorg if you want to gather statistics on this continues unabated and so some people forget that the young woman in front of them is not to be sexually objectified the prevalence of the bias against funding women should lead to a huge competitive advantage to the partners and firms that do fund women and are gender blind i get asked so often for a list of vcs who would be truly unbiased i think i need to create the list if you have a fund that is actively looking for women founders or have had a great experience with one send me an email but the really tough question here is does speaking out accomplish anything i chose not to speak out in the s and s and if that makes you angry stop reading here i became very practiced at simply ignoring the sexual actions  the hand on my knee all through a coffee meeting  the hand on the back of my neck under my hair while talking with me  the stroking of my shoulder  all while i was clearly married in my head i was made of stone the action did not touch me i believed if i simply ignored it and pretended it was not happening it would stop most of the time it did sometimes i would have to lift the hand off my body and then sometimes the action would be so aggressive i would get upset and not be able to turn off my anger and i would need to remove myself from the situation before i blew up i did not believe speaking up would change anything and was sure to backfire unwanted male attention was my responsibility and shameful perchance the influence of the nuns in my middle school so i was not surprised when the one time i did go to hr for help with the unwanted attention of an executive i was told that if i made a fuss and sued i could get a settlement but my career would be over instead they gave me the words to say to get him to back off  turns out he had been warned before but he was a valuable guy and they were confident the right language would get the message across i did and it worked but their words youll never work in this business again stuck with me no question the very brave women who have spoken up recently including susan fowler who wrote the blog post reflecting on one very very strange year at uber will make local change happen the situations they call out will change for the better in the short term i do believe the tactic of brushing the complaint under the rug wont work now so that is good but to get to systemic change in the long run we need to get away from the boys club to get away from situation after situation being dominated by men often with no peerlevel women in the room for most of my career i have been the only woman in the room and often treated as an honorary male ive heard my share of locker room talk even now and every time i choose my reaction  usually a blend of humor and outrage  just enough to get the message across without damaging my relationship with the speaker i frequently raise the need to have more women on management teams and in the board room although it often falls on deaf ears and i have to be careful not to be difficult and i am sure some think i am but i know for certain that once there are  or  women in a partnership or in a management team or on a board not only do the decisions improve lots of research coming out about this now but also the locker room talk and unconscious bias decreases i have great confidence that most of the men i have worked with are not sexual harassers and do not wish to be biased but we all have unconscious bias and gender bias is one that we are only now really starting to grapple with in the technology industry the industry is big enough and the bro culture prevalent enough particularly with many of the new economy companies that we must deal with it to do that we need to attract women into tech help them stay in tech coach them promote them and get them into leadership positions in venture partnerships and companies so we can build a better culture in the industry so does speaking up accomplish anything the answer is maybe depending on your role sometimes you can make more difference working from the inside but huge credit to the women that do and to the men that are outspoken about the need for change email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest posted by penny herscher at  pm  comments email

companies are like families they are full of tension tight relationships dreams and disappointments and they form a culture all of their own and when they are small how each and every employee behaves affects the culture of the company what it is like to come to work every day how people solve problems how they interact and help each other or dont in every group of employees you hire you are bound to hire a few non performers and its management  that you know you have to move the non performers out thats what having an accountable team or a performance culture means but there is a group of employees that is harder to move on im sure youve worked with people like this they are good at their job but they are like dripping poison they talk about this place or this company in negative terms they make snide remarks about the leadership or about their coworkers they work for you because its a good job but nothing is good enough clearly if the behavior is egregious you can move on the employee and treat it as a performance problem but what if its borderline one way to handle this is to invite your employees to leave the most valuable resource an employee has is their time especially when they are in the early stages of their careers in terms of personal growth and future earning power every year before  is more valuable that five after your millennial employees are investing in your company with their time learning growing inhaling everything they can do to improve their future so if they are negative why are they there i talk to many teams and my logic to invite people to leave goes something like this if you love this company and our mission if you love working here then invest your time wisely pour in your passion work hard to make the company and your career they best they can be be a part of creating a positive winning culture share your observations with your leaders but bring solutions not just complaints support your leaders  they are human too and doing their best be positive but if you are unhappy here if you see all the things that are wrong and you feel a need to continuously complain if you think your leadership is incompetent or the work is too hard then please leave get out because life is too short to work in a company or a job you dont like for people you dont respect if you think things could be better then make them better or please leave sometimes i am even more direct  theres the door email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest posted by penny herscher at  pm  comments email this labels career advice career growth ceo company culture complaining negative employees team building wednesday april   startups and adrenaline are a potent mix fred wilsons post a few days ago starting is easy finishing is hard speaks to the grind going on for many tech startups today he says the easy exit days feel as if they have gone and for many it is taking raw tenacity to finish and hes right when you are the ceo or in the founding team of a startup the years are long it feels as if it will take forever to get to the next stage of product or growth or market development but the days are short and its what makes the days short that draws in many founders its the adrenaline yes they should have a vision and passion to change the world a passion to get rich typically backfires but without a love of the adrenaline rush they would not last a year you feel the adrenaline every single day when you close a deal when you talk with your team about your dreams when you pitch a vc whether or not they bite when you have a vision match with a huge customer when you can feel the forward progress your heart beats faster your hands may shake its hard to come down many startup ceos i have known me included self medicate with a stiff drink at the end of the day its hard to sleep but it makes am exciting because you know the rush is going to start again the next day in many ways you need the drug its a hormone in your body it makes your mind sharp it increases your intensity it helps you focus on exactly what you need to do second to second to win in each situation and succeeding is all about having the tenacity to win against a million peoplecircumstancesbarriers that want to stop you every day getting a new company up and running and successful is so hard that i dont advise people to do it unless they simply cannot stand not to and only then if they have the stomach for the stress and can manage themselves through it i am working with a brilliant founder today who is swinging from the heights of heaven to the depths of hell as her company leaps forward and who has designed a swimming and yoga weekly schedule simply to help her manage the stress and whats interesting about the adrenaline phenomenon is one day it all stops i ran into a girlfriend at the airport this week who ran a hugely successful company and is now retired and as we compared notes she told me she just stopped enjoying the rush and then she knew it was time when you dread the am calls and you dread taking another redeye and while you can still get the rush in front of a customer but not every day then its time to hand the baton to the next woman who wants to change the world email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest posted by penny herscher at  am  comments email this labels adrenaline ceo leadership startup to ipo startups tuesday march    reasons to visit jordan this year when i decided to visit jordan in january this year i was surprised by how many of my friends and family reacted with is it safe or arent you scared truth is i was uncertain but not scared and absolutely determined the war in syria the increasing risk in turkey and the destruction of ancient works of art like the assyrian statues and the temple of bel at palmyra break my heart at many levels art is mankinds highest achievement and i refuse to be intimidated into not experiencing as much of it as i can especially in the near east which is the cultural cradle of our species i have had jerash in my sights for many years now and when i had the opportunity to go back to israel and into gaza this january my blog post on that trip is here i decided to put  days in jordan on the front end and see jerash with my own eyes everything about jordan was marvelous everything i encourage you to go and see for yourself heres why  it’s safe i never once felt unsafe in jordan from arriving at the very modern queen alia airport to walking through the souk right after a friday demonstration at the mosque and surrounded by jordanian men dressed in black  who were buying fruit and vegetables to take home for dinner  to driving the length of the country i felt safe and welcomed the whole time as my guide raud said to me the cia listens in on all the cell phones and  of what they hear is dont forget to pick up yoghurt on your way home yes the hotels take security precautions that are very similar to those in india looking in the trunk mirrors under the car and there is a noticeable police presence but this is a country where the british still have a strong presence the army is trained by officers from sandhurst and anyone you interact with as a tourist speaks good english while jordan did have a terror attack last year at kerak it is not as dangerous as the united states and you are more likely to die in your bathtub than from a terrorist attack  petra  probably the most famous tourist site in jordan petra like wadi rum has to be seen to be believed it was developed by the nabataeans  years ago but then also developed by the romans and byzantines along with a roman theatre carved out of red rock petra is famous for the huge tomb facades cut out of rock you may know the treasury featured in the indiana jones movie but this is just one of many the biggest facade cut into a mountain is the monastery which is a  ft climb above the valley floor and next to it are panoramic views into the jordanian desert its fascinating and stunning at the same time you walk into petra down through the siq a natural break in the rock with cliffs towering above you on the either side of the narrow passage everything can be walked easily but at the end of a long day it is great fun to ride donkeys up and out of the valley mine was called michael jackson i think he was named for tourists like me but he was an easy ride until recently  people visited petra every day now it is down to  because tourists are afraid although there is nothing to be afraid of there so if you go into the park early as the sun is rising you can walk down the siq alone and soak in the beauty of the treasury almost alone except for a few camels magical  the ethereal beauty of wadi rum  wadi rum is one of the most beautiful places i have ever seen in my life orange sands pink and brown and ochre rock formations continuously changing light and sky mountains that come close and then move away as the sun sinks and billions of stars i sat and stared in the light and in the dark for hours fascinated and moved by the incredible beauty to get a taste watch lawrence of arabia or theeb both filmed in the wadi rum desert or even the martian but even these beautiful films cant prepare you for the huge humbling beauty of the desert for the adventurous riding a camel is an experience not very comfortable if you are new at it  i need more practice to get confident enough to cross my legs rather than ride astride  dinar per day to rent a snowboard for the sandunes  wandering lamb  jordan is not a place to go on a diet because the sheepgoatlamb you are offered has been part of a wandering herd and has not always had a secure food supply its meat is higher in fat and so quite simply delicious roast lamb shank with salted yoghurt lamb skewers lamb meatballs  with meze of all types and the best olives in my life northern jordan is rich farming country so they grow all their own vegetables tons of citrus and so many tomatoes they export them to the region i have no photos of the lamb i think i must have been distracted by the delicious smell every time my first evening at the four seasons in the jordanian restaurant the waiter figured out i was a woman traveling alone from then on the chef kept sending me his specialities so that i should feel welcome and experience the best of jordanian cuisine enjoying the explosion of flavors along with some great red jordanian wine i could not have felt more welcomed  the romans were there  the greeks and romans developed great cities in the levant to support the trade routes and jerash was one of the decapolis  the  great cities or maybe more that were in a cooperative league it stood until the great earthquake of ad and much of it remained buried until the th century but now it is an extensive excavated site of a wealthy grecoroman city it has magnificent gates and theaters and fountains and greek temples and floors from byzantine churches it was on a major pilgrim route and so was developed by the christians long after the western romans had gone i had a guide here and walked the entire site he said i was the first client he had that wanted to see everything he fell asleep in the car later that day much to the amusement of my driver  layers of history from the greeks to islam in the center of amman you can visit the citadel  the administrative heart of the city  above a huge roman theatre originally developed in  bc it was conquered by the greeks in bc and named philadelphia occupied by the romans and then became muslim in ad its a fascinating site with many layers of different histories although very run down with not much left standing but its interesting to see the successive rulers and to see it was governed by  successive dynasties of muslim rulers the archeological museum has the oldest known statues of a man and woman thought to have been made about  bc  moses and his view of israel  if you remember your bible youll known moses was shown the holy land from mount nebo and then died somewhere in moab the site where moses is believed to have been on mount nebo is now a major christian visitor site it is set up for thousands of visitors although there were maybe  of us there and while there is a new church on the site beautifully integrated above the floor of a byzantine church the real draw is the view of israel and the dead sea the oldest map of the holy land is nearby  a large floor mosaic in the church at madaba jordan and israel are small and close and they have only been separate for less then  years standing on the mountain top looking across the beautiful landscape i was struck again by how close and intertwined their histories are  castles for and against the crusaders the crusader era castles in jordan are just as dramatic and romantic as you can imagine the largest is at kerak and was built by the franks the europeans who lead by the papacy tried to take and hold the holy land for  years but i could not get to kerak on this trip and so i went instead to a deeply atmospheric castle built by a nephew of saladin it was built on the top of a hill in the th century on the site of an earlier christian monastery and named after one of the monks ajlun it is a magnificent example of classic th century castle building not unlike castles i have visited in england and france winding corridors wind and rain swept battlements with panoramic views into israel and a few more people this time although all arab the only place i ever saw other european or american tourists on my whole trip was petra  castles for caravans  well off the beaten tourist track i visited the umayyad desert castles of qasr amra and qasr kharana about a  hour drive into the desert east of amman these are not castles as we think of them but caravansary or palaces   safe places for traders to stay the night on the spice routes they are isolated and very lovely but what is particularly fabulous about qasr amra is that what is left standing is the bathhouse and the inside is covered in frescoes this was built around ad by islamic caliphates but the frescoes are not only rich beautiful and evocative of a time when the area was lush with water they also have human representation  something which is now forbidden in islam the paintings reminded me of both persian and christian styles of the times and they are quite simply gorgeous for their time  warmth of spirit  everyone i spoke with was warm welcoming and glad i was there from my driver mohammed  who insisted on stopping at his favorite bakery to share his favorite bread  to my guide raud who bought me oranges from a farmer on the roadside  i could not have felt more at ease true i did not speak with any women it is a male dominated culture but i was never made to feel less than for being a woman the travel concierge team at indagarecom supported me on this trip i had a driver between locations and a guide at the major sites  everything was very smooth here is my itinerary in case youd like to plan your own trip day  landed in the evening in amman stayed

to pinterest posted by penny herscher at  am  comments email this labels board diversity diversity hop llc kim clancy thursday february   its time for tone at the top on diversity  or why uber is yet another wakeup call for boards and ceos in tech uber is just the latest company caught in the act of discriminating against women in its workforce sadly for many minorities in tech this is an old story as ellen pao writes in todays time article it is an indication of techs existential rot in a world that started off seemingly harmlessly by white men funding white men with few exceptions when only white men were given opportunities only white men were successful white men went on hiring only white men because it seemed to be a common trait of successful employees then investors who were white men decided only white men could be successful and doubled down on white men white men who succeeded in the system decided it worked and saw no need for change fifty years later investors can’t break out of that pattern but it is time for the pattern to break for many reasons there is mounting evidence that diverse teams build better products  they are more likely to understand the buying behavior of their customers if they reflect the customer there is also growing research that companies with diverse boards and management teams produce better returns for investors so now some investors are encouraging boards to take on diverse board members but more importantly it is no longer acceptable for companies to allow employee harassment to continue while hr departments stand by or worse become part of the problem as uber is finding out to its detriment the deleteuber campaign has been due for a while and will hurt note i switched to lyft a year ago after reading about the leadership culture at uber   so if it is no longer acceptable at the board level in the executive team and in the engineering ranks what can we do to make change happen faster  i have worked in the bro culture of tech in silicon valley for more than  years i have repeatedly experienced unconscious bias sometimes not so unconscious  being underestimated being dismissed being propositioned etc and i have worked hard to over come it as i became a ceo who grew my company through a successful ipo and acquisition and as i have done so i have been open and public about my wish to be a role model to other women that you can be technical and be in a leadership role and have a family in the technology industry its possible to do and be happy i was conscious of the challenge i was facing from day one when i was one of only a handful i think  women majoring in math at cambridge in my year out of about  and so to be a role model i have always tried to hold a leadership position in any situation i am in especially if everyone else in the room is male it is so clear to me now that the problem we have in tech is not a pipeline problem yes we need more little girls to like computers and more little african american boys to believe they can be mark zuckerberg but we have plenty already who enter the tech world but the women leave in droves within  years because the environment is hostile our problem is keeping women in an industry that makes life difficult for them it is time to set the tone at the top to insist that boards have at least  or  women on them not just none or the we have one so were done you see on so many boards there are now several recruiters who specialize in finding qualified women with the right experience for boards for example beth stewart of trewstar would tell you there is no shortage of qualified women to serve but a shortage of boards who think this is an important issue it is also time for boards to insist that the ceo builds a diverse leadership team this takes real work to find diverse qualified executives but it can be done in most fields uber is just one of many examples where a mostly male leadership team is simply deaf and blind to the issues facing their female employees tone at the top is an expression used by boards when reviewing the results of the annual audit they discuss whether the management team is committed to honest ethical behavior and whether they operate with integrity the discussion is important to sign off the financials  after all what audit committee chair would want to sign off the financial filings if he did not believe the ceo and cfo had integrity with the numbers its time for companies to embrace a tone at the top discussion around equal opportunity for all employees it is time for every board to pay attention to the diversity statistics within their companies how many women are employed at every level has the company done an audit of pay across gender to check that women are not paid less than men for the same job are the percentages of women in leadership growing or shrinking it is just not hard for hr to run reports and track progress over time  but it takes a serious discussion on the importance of diversity from the board down to build a world class company in the st century i am hoping this is what eric holder and my friend arianna huffington will now do for uber email

uber women in leadership thursday january   breakfast in gaza dinner in efrat impressions from my trip to israel and palestine i first went to israel in march  i went at the invitation of a good friend who was teaching a class in tel aviv and went because i was longing to explore the ancient history of the area i packed in a week of experience  as a tourist and as a mentor across  years of jewish roman christian and muslim history and i was hooked tel aviv jerusalem the river jordan beit shean masada cesarea herodium energy culture technology history and food fantastic but on the same trip i found family my husband did not know he had a jewish family of cousins living in new york until they found us in mid  he was not raised jewish first cousins not distant cousins and one of his cousins sons is a orthodox settler in the west bank so on the same trip i visited his family in efrat  after all they are family as fivel drove me around the west bank explaining what i was seeing i saw the walls and the settlements and the palestinians villages and while i saw with my eyes i could not really understand what i was seeing or the implications of what i was seeing on the lives of the people living there so i spent the last  months studying with a focus on the history of the region trying to get some grasp of the complexity of the situation i read books covering the last  years of the middle east the last  years and the british mandate the last  years and selfserving colonial interference the last  years of the state of israel the last  years of the impact of obamas policy and i felt i barely scratched the surface of understanding  was my year of saying yes and so when sitting in an outside cafe in mountain view i was asked if i could go to gaza to mentor entrepreneurs i took a deep breath and said yes i had the anchor for my next trip and so on january th  i found myself eating breakfast in the besieged town of gaza city with dinner plans in an israeli settlement in efrat in the west bank gaza strip is a small area of israel with close to  million people in it living under siege the reasons are very complex but the result is the people of gaza are not allowed to leave without a permit and a special reason they live with limited resources limited access to electricity youth unemployment at close to  an oppressive local government bombed out buildings poverty and the continuous risk of renewal of war many told me they have no future the future for gaza is black and the young people want to leave and yet they survive and try to thrive they go to university get married have children take care of their parents dance eat and now have the chance to build tech startups gaza sky geeks is a startup accelerator in gaza city run by an amazing dedicated team from mercy corps the only one of its kind in gaza strip once you are in through the door it has the feel of a typical incubator lots of young entrepreneurs high energy laughing laptops everywhere people camped out whenever they can get to a plug and unlike silicon valley  women most of the businesses are very early stage most of the ones i talked to fall into the category of web applications or platforms to solve issues in the region for example a mobile phone app to connect distressed arab mothers with online advice or a platform to connect freelancers in a more efficient financial model suitable for the middle east but the gaza startups have significantly more headwind than youd find in silicon valley or even in tel aviv they have no access to paypal payment systems you can read about this issue here they have very uncertain power at home although gsg just successfully raised money to buy a generator for the office space they have limited access to seed funding limited access to legal support need an education on what it means to run a business to make meaningful progress and yet despite their significant challenges they are creative and determined to succeed i spent only two days with gsg because of my schedule and would have been happy to spend ten  its an exciting place to be and very much in need of mentors especially in coding product management and marketing it takes a permit from both israel and hamas to cross the border in and out of gaza and the crossing is not simple its orwellian and random and i was disappointed to see that even israel the security technology leader of the world did not have a system to analyze my history and digital footprint and determine i am not a threat this is a business opportunity i left gaza city at pm crossed the border at erez finally at pm and arrived in jerusalem by pm since i stayed in west jerusalem last time i chose to stay in east jerusalem this time at the american colony hotel which is over a hundred years old and built in colonial times i felt right at home off to dinner with family that evening we drive to efrat as fivel gives me a running highly educated commentary of what i am seeing there are about  settlers in the west bank another  in east jerusalem and many are american so it makes sense that the settlements look like us suburbia nice white houses with red roofs gardens and often on hilltops for defensive reasons you could be in the midwest except for the barbed wire protection around them the palestinian villages look similar but different they are white houses with white roofs black water tanks and a mosque in every village and big red signs at the entrances saying israelis are forbidden to enter and while the settlers have easy access to jerusalem for work the palestinians do not they must go through a crossing point and be checked but family life in efrat and the palestinian villages is not unlike family life anywhere else in the world kids go to school people run small businesses their kids wont go to bed they worry about their kids future but they also all worry about what the long term looks like for peace and financial prosperity and obviously there is no comparison between the difficulty of life in gaza and the challenges of the two communities living in the west bank i wont take sides in this conflict  i dont know enough both sides seem entrenched and politically responsible for this terrible situation but who am i to judge but i asked questions during my trip i spoke with a palestinian business leader who just wishes the israelis would leave her country and i was reminded of the gazan entrepreneur who told me she just wished they had the quality of life of the palestinians in the west bank i spoke with israelis who feel strongly that security is the top issue and they are determined to ensure jews never come close to extinction again and israelis who long for a democracy and peace with their arab neighbors after my surreal day spanning the two worlds i spent the next few days mentoring and teaching i met with women entrepreneurs in tel aviv at startup nation central and was very impressed by their businesses drive and intellect i taught an emba class on being a ceo at hebrew university to wannabe vcs who were intense and funny and a joy to talk with  and interested in how they can help gaza this is a small place and everyones lives are in the end intertwined for me the small way i can help is on the ground with women and entrepreneurs i have believed for many years now that our world will only become sane when women hold equal power to men most women are not as violent when most women make money they invest in the family and education the long term solution is women also having financial power investing in a peaceful future i also believe in the state of israel and the need for it to exist and thrive whatever the past it is here and here to stay but the long term path to peace is that the people living on israels borders in israels occupied territories of palestine and in jordan have jobs and a future and hope they need a healthy economy so i have decided i will to the extent i am permitted to help on the ground mentoring entrepreneurs and women in israel gaza and palestine the middle east and islam dominates so much of our global and us politics and its so complicated that i encourage you if you have not done so already to go and see for yourself and if youre willing volunteer mentor for gaza sky geeks reading resources huffpo article on gaza sky geeks

the silk roads west bank women ceos tuesday january   how  rocked my world as i talked with women entrepreneurs i am more convinced than ever that there is a bright future for women entrepreneurs and  proved it to me i stepped back from being a full time ceo a little more than a year ago it was time for family reasons and i set out to change my life i still work i serve on two public company boards but i decided to spend a great deal more time with my father and my family than i have ever been able to do before and to prioritize my time to giving back but i had no idea what that really meant for me – what could i do that was meaningful other than work as a ceo i decided that i would just say “yes” to every request for help from entrepreneurs especially but not exclusively women not that i would be a pushover and do anything i was asked but i would say yes to any request for a meeting from an entrepreneur who wanted advice a first meeting at least and if i thought i could make a difference id keep saying yes i wish i could say i was inspired by shonda rhimes’ ted talk but i did not see it until i was well into the year instead i was thinking of it as following breadcrumbs without knowing where they were going to lead its been an extraordinary year its taken me in directions i never would have expected and its changing me ive met with many amazing female entrepreneurs aged twenties to sixties a psychiatrist who has figured out how to use technology to dramatically reduce the cost of cognitive testing for veterans with ptsd or the elderly with dementia a media executive with a passion for travel whos changing how people explore the world a technologist whos figured out how to measure skin tone so you can buy the right makeup for your skin a ceo with an iot product that can tell you all about the water leakage risks in your commercial property assets something i did not know was a big problem a woman revolutionizing the sex tech industry a woman with breakthrough security technology to protect your phone a visionary who set up the first and only incubator in gaza a new calendaring app a better travel itinerary planning app a next generation geospatial model better onchip failsafe technology the artistic director of a ballet networking technology machine learning technology  the whole gamut i have found i love talking with entrepreneurs and ceos i love listening to their stories about their businesses what’s working what’s scaring them how they are getting funded i ask questions ad nausea and then focus in on one of two challenges they face and discuss with them how to overcome them its fun for both of us and i realize i can help many of them no judgement just the experience of being there myself more than once before and i now believe more than ever it is much harder for women to get venture funding than men i have far too many data points now ive met with women hedge fund managers who only invest in women led companies recruiters whose only business is placing women on boards bankers who want to do deals for women ceos the movement is happening women are more than ever proactively helping women i threw a book party for joann lublin’s new book earning it  the party was  days after our horrific election  and i saw  women eating my husbands terrific food and drinking good wine talking to each other about how this cannot be our future and becoming even more committed to make a different future for women but i also visited israel for the first time and i was hooked i found israel fascinating and a historical goldmine but then i spent time in the west bank with family who are orthodox settlers and at the same time joined a small group trying to help palestine with silicon valley technology wow that is a complex area i am reading like crazy trying to understand but its also an area where young women are starting businesses and where i can help  wasnt all about female entrepreneurs ive spent  of the year in europe driving with my dad through france quiet days with him in england helping him write his life story italy with my daughter with my husband with my sister enough time that i know i was truly present for my family for the first time in a long time i am not unaware that it is a privilege for me to be able to do this but i also now recognize that it is not only money that holds us in our jobs it is also social status recognition a sense of being important one of my new friends now in her seventies and who had a very big high profile ceo job told me one of the things she found most difficult about retiring was not being important any more we are all in our own ways driven by ego and giving up the identity that defined me for most of my adult life has had its hard moments like when a man asked me at a fundraiser what i do for a living and when i said i am retired he said “oh” and walked away ive had plenty of invisible moments this year and it takes some getting used to we may feel its hard for women entrepreneurs in  but the groundswell is growing the number of smart women building businesses inspires me the number of powerful female ceos inspires me and in  i am open

personal journey raising money startups venture capital women in tech tuesday december   so you want to join a board advice to help you prepare if you want to join a board you are not alone some people want to find a board in the middle of their career because they like the idea of learning about board life or for the status of it some people are looking for board work towards the end of their career because they want to stay engaged and give back either way its a common serious interest for many people but what does it take  how do you prepare yourself to be qualified first off determine why you want it  and be able to articulate that are you looking for income or interest be clear about this because there is a huge difference between the two nonprofit boards typically dont pay in fact they expect you to give money forprofit private company boards may pay cash or they may only pay in stock which may or may not ever be worth anything and forprofit public company boards pay but the pay varies widely depending on the size industry and country of the company once you can clearly state what you want and why the next step is for you to determine what value you are going to bring  what is your value proposition what experience do you bring how will you be helpful why should a board want you on it i had never done this formally until a few weeks ago when i was on a panel and the moderator asked us panelists to write down our value propositions this is what i came up with late at night in a hotel room as someone who has  years as a high tech ceo has been through an ipo and many ma deals  and who is very technical i bring experience in what it takes to create the strategy execution plans and leadership teams necessary to drive growth as a compensation committee chair on two public boards i team with the ceo to create the right incentives to execute the operational plans and create shareholder value i tend to be the voice in the room focused on strategy and the needs of the leadership team in a rapidly changing world try writing yours  what would you say another way to approach this is to inventory your skills make a list of what youre good at  what makes you unique this is your experience  what types of jobs youve had  plus what is it about your intellect and personality that will be helpful are you good under pressure are you energized by solving hard problems are you good at negotiation are you natural coach do you have strong pl management experience these are skills that are often not on your resume but when a recruiter asks you what you would bring to a board its good to be able to confidently state the top  or  skills that you would bring the next challenge is that while  you may feel you are ready to contribute on a board many boards will not want to hire someone with no previous experience this is one of the top objections that prevents boards diversifying  boards tend to hire people they know who are like them who have served on boards before its less work than hiring someone who is different and needs training but as the trend towards building more diverse boards continues nomination committees are coming to terms with hiring board members without previous experience one of the ways you can prepare yourself is to go and take training i am a member of the volunteer faculty at a two day intensive training course  the nextgen directors academy  designed to take a small group of diverse aspiring future board members through the nuts and bolts of being on a board we cover the basic responsibilities what each committee is responsible for what your institutional investors care about and case studies of boards who got off track with activists its an interactive peer to peer format and there are no stupid questions there are several courses around like this but not all have deep intense content so make sure you talk with previous attendees before you sign up another way you can prepare is to make sure you have the business basics covered most of the top business schools run executive training classes from a few days to several weeks ranging from general management preparation to specialized skills like cyber security once you have inventoried your own skills and experience think about whether you have a gap you need to fill with some training or whether you want to develop a skill that is currently in high demand for board members one of the ephemeral requirements of many boards is fit boards are expected to be collegiate to get along to voice difference but in the end come together on decisions i could write a tome on whether this is healthy for the shareholders or not but not here if you want to get onto a company board but have no experience to point to try joining a nonprofit board first pick one that is a decent size k a year in budget that has a real board that meets  times a year and that is run by an experienced chairperson reading the prep materials listening to the management team sitting in the meetings contributing to the discussion in a balanced collegiate way will bring you confidence and experience that you can then refer to when you discuss your first forprofit board make sure you have the time to be an effective board member being on a board carries status with it it sounds important and it may pay well and many boards have  meetings a year so it doesnt sound like much but actually board work can take a huge amount of time on a regular basis you need to put the time aside to read to prepare and to attend the meetings but in addition you will have countless phone calls and phone meetings outside of the regular meetings you will need to meet with the ceo and members of the executive team and if the board needs to find a new ceo for whatever reason expect to spend days and days over a series of months meeting candidates and discussing them with the other board members so before you pour time into preparing yourself to sit on a board make sure your day job allows you enough time to truly contribute and finally dont be shy if you want to get on a board say so tell everyone you talk with about boards that you are yourself looking for a board seat network with recruiters who specialize and stay in touch with them so you are current in their minds talk to people who are already on boards finding the right board is a pretty random process and so getting the word out will help the right board find you email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest posted by penny herscher at  am

magical ancient history glorious art beautiful countryside and marvelous food and wine my christmas present from bret this year was he was willing to go to sicily with me without his kiting gear  and for those of you who know him this is a big give so we set out guidebooks in hand and explored i got started with an overview of sicilian history through the book sicily by john julius norwich this book walks through  years and is an expression of the authors long standing love affair with the island it gives a rich backdrop to help you understand what you are seeing every day your can see our route here magical mosaics the normans ruled sicily for a hundred years through most of the th century and left behind the most glorious byzantine mosaics a visit to monreale cathedral and the capella palentina both built by roger ii are a must for any art lover its easy to wander around palermo following in the normans footsteps through churches cathedrals and the great norman palace then move forward a hundred years to the time of frederick ii stupor mundi the wonder of the world and think about his extraordinary achievements while standing by his porphyry tomb the normans and frederick ii were rich cultured religiously tolerant and clearly had an eye for beauty and visual story telling gold angels old and new testament stories on every surface artists from egypt decorated the chambers of roger ii and frederick ii is it a mosque is it a church or is it now a victorian garden but the romans also developed sicily and one of the best preserved roman villa floors in the world is in the middle of eastern sicily at piazza armerina  the roman villa casale built in the early th century every room has gorgeous complex well preserved mosaics on the floors hunting scenes lovers athletes childrens whimsical playtime its overwhelming forgotten for many years it is now a unesco site and while off the beaten path well worth the effort to get there the lovers on the floor of the master bedroom greek temples ah the riches segesta selinute agrigento  each captured our imagination as we walked through reconstructed temples and climbed over the remains of even bigger fallen temples the greeks started building in sicily by  bc and built vast cities warring with each other but while the temples were abandoned by bc the sites were not so in each case you can visit for an hour or two  or for a day  depending on your taste speaking of taste when an old man hands you a flyer inviting you to his restaurant which is  km down a dirt track from the site accept the invitation one of our best meals was at a farmhouse surrounded by goats with no menu where no one spoke english but everything was made by the old mans wife yum agrigento  jaw dropping all these ruined temples are very atmospheric but the best is not a temple it is the duomo in syracuse while masquerading as a duomo now it is actually a greek temple where the gaps between the columns have simply been filled in with tufa blocks the inner and outer colonnades are in place and the columns are exposed so as you walk through you feel you are actually still inside a pagan temple but it has a thin veneer of monotheism on top is it a church or a temple with a thin veneer of course because there were greeks there are also greek theaters from the small one at the hilltop in segesta to the huge one in syracuse to the panoramic one in taormina every one has to be explored syracuse theatre site of many opening nights  years ago marmalade sicily is a perfect climate for citrus and the south east corner is the best  miles and miles and miles of lemons oranges grapefruits and hundreds of varieties at the marchesi di san giuliano they have been making marmalade for  years all organically only from fruit on their land everything is cut by hand everything is prepared cooked and bottled by hand we requested a marmalade tasting in advance and after getting lost a few times found ourselves at a small farm where they had rolled out the red carpet the chief cook hosted us and she had made a lemon marmalade tart as well as prepared bread butter and a selection of all their marmalades to try the whole experience was delicious and amusing and even more so when i innocently asked how many people come to taste marmalade a year and they answered you are the first we satisfied their curiosity about our strangeness when we told them we are english foggy erice even in late september sicily is hot tshirts sandals hats and sunscreen except in the small mountaintop village of erice erice is at  feet with sheer cliffs on  slides and a defensive wall built by daedalus the town is walled in with cobble streets and no room for cars although of course you dont know that when google maps says you can drive to your hotel and you break numerous traffic laws figuring out you cant there is a small norman castle at the top of course on the site of an ancient greek temple and by mid afternoon we were completely shrouded in fog on brief breaks in the fog we could see down to the glittering sea but then wed be back in the clouds  perfect for a spooky abandoned castle erice castle and the cliff face down to trapani there is so much to see in sicily and there is something for everyone expansive white beaches cocktails on the harbor wall wine tasting caravaggios museums and easy driving everyone we spoke to was friendly and pleased to help us and our fellow travelers were from all over europe and rarely from the us if you have not been put it on your bucket list the view from the ancient greek theatre in taormina i worked with the team at indagarecom for all reservations  and cannot say enough about this service excellence at every turn and they booked us into everything from a  star hotel with worn carpets but still the best hotel in erice and the best coffee of the trip to a  room super quiet agritourism hotel in the middle of an orange grove to the  star experience of the villa athena in
