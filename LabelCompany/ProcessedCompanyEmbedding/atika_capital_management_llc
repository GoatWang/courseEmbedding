employ a longshort equity strategy and focus on the healthcare technologymediatelecom tmt and consumer sectors portfolio manager    gilder gagnon howe  co llc our firm was founded to help small investors build significant capital over time since we believe in owning as many promising stocks as possible we generally buy on margin borrowing to invest can force liquidations if the market collapses so we try to balance this exposure by selling short this ability to seek investments both up and downstream is rarely available to smaller investors we however view it as an effective tool that doubles our clients dollars at work it also doubles our commissions while moderately reducing their exposure to abrupt swings in the market our approach is not for the shortterm investor clients must be able and willing to accept risks accounts will experience sharp fluctuations month to month year to year it takes a strong stomach to invest with us clients entrust decision making for their accounts to us we buy and sell without asking our clients to authorize in advance each transaction we are paid commissions for our work analyst prior ubs ag ubs ag provides financial advisory
