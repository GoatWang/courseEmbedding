lansdowne welcomed the publication of the code is supportive of its objectives and has committed to the code the principles of the code which is applied on a “comply or explain” basis are that institutional investors should  publicly disclose their policy on how they will discharge their stewardship responsibilities  have a robust policy on managing conflicts of interest in relation to

their policy on how they will discharge their stewardship responsibilities this policy is published so that investors and investee companies are aware of the way in which lansdowne integrates stewardship activities into its investment process lansdowne has outlined in this statement each of the principles of the code and how it complies with them or explains why it does not engagement with investee companies is primarily the responsibility of the investment teams and the respective portfolio managers lansdowne considers access to management an important part of investment in core positions and will generally meet with the management of core positions either quarterly or half yearly in order to discuss issues such as governance strategy socialenvironmental impact and shareholder value lansdowne believes that its engagement with management on such issues is integral to the discharge of its stewardship responsibilities and the interests of its clients lansdowne is unlikely to invest in companies where it appears that management is not acting in the best interests of shareholders lansdowne’s proxy voting procedures and recordkeeping are overseen by lansdowne’s operations team who subject to lansdowne’s policies and procedures refer to the applicable portfolio manager for voting decisions when doing so portfolio managers are provided with reports from iss europe limited “iss” a third party which the firm has engaged to provide corporate research and to facilitate the voting of proxies where the instruction from the portfolio manager is contrary to the recommendation of iss a reason will be requested and will be recorded in the proxy voting log whilst lansdowne does utilise iss to assist in proxy voting it does not generally outsource its stewardship responsibilities lansdowne’s compliance team carry out a quarterly review of the proxy voting log to ensure consistency with the firm’s proxy voting policy principle  institutional investors should have a robust policy on managing conflicts of interest in relation to stewardship and this policy should be publicly disclosed lansdowne maintains a robust policy on managing conflicts of interest which is designed to ensure its decisions are taken wholly in the interest of its clients lansdowne aims to ensure that all potential and actual conflicts are identified evaluated managed monitored and recorded lansdowne’s ownership structure is that of a private limited liability partnership managing assets for multiple pooled investment funds and segregated managed accounts material potential conflicts of interest including but not limited to policies with respect to trade allocation personal account dealing best execution and outside business interests are disclosed to clients and prospective clients in lansdowne’s form adv  due diligence questionnaires and where appropriate relevant client agreements as part of lansdowne’ conflicts of interest policy all members of staff must notify lansdowne’s chief compliance officer cco if they become aware of any material conflict of interest arising including in relation to voting proxies on behalf of clients where such a material conflict of interest is identified voting instructions will be subject to assessment and approval by the cco our principal objectives when considering matters such as engagement and voting are always to act in the best interests of our clients and to treat them fairly a summary of the lansdowne’s conflicts of interest policy is available to clients upon request from lansdowne’s chief compliance officer principle  institutional investors should monitor their investee companies comprehensive and continuous research and monitoring of investee companies is fundamental to lansdowne’s investment process lansdowne utilises various research and support tools to meet this principle the monitoring process will include meeting with senior management of the investee companies analysing annual reports and financial statements using independent third party and broker research attending company meetings and road shows and proxy voting corporate research provided by iss lansdowne endeavours to identify problems at an early stage to minimise any loss of shareholder value if investment teams have concerns where appropriate they will use their best efforts to ensure that the appropriate members of the investee company’s board are made aware of them such concerns may include amongst other things corporate governance issues where we believe they have an impact on shareholder value including where applicable deviations from the uk corporate governance code however in seeking to act in the best interests of its clients lansdowne may also consider it better to reduce or eliminate an investment rather than to continue such dialogue lansdowne investment teams review the effectiveness of their monitoring on an ongoing basis as part of the investment process lansdowne maintains records of votes cast and of reasons where voting is contrary to the recommendation of iss it is not always administratively possible to record whether such votes were cast in respect of contentious issues due to the inherent subjectivity this entails or to record details of every engagement with management of investee companies lansdowne may attend general meetings of companies in which its clients have a major holding where this is considered appropriate and practicable lansdowne does not generally wish to be made insiders in normal circumstances and therefore expects investee companies and their advisers to ensure that information that could affect lansdowne’s ability to deal in the shares of the company concerned is not conveyed to lansdowne without its prior agreement principle  institutional investors should establish clear guidelines on when and how they will escalate their activities as a method of protecting and enhancing shareholder value as part of lansdowne’s investment strategy it seeks to build effective relationships with boards and management at the companies in which it invests lansdowne will generally look to invest in companies that it believes to be well managed as part of the research and monitoring process lansdowne may look to intervene by holding meetings with management andor directors to express lansdowne’s concerns or express its views through other channels these concerns will generally be motivated by the failure of management to uphold shareholder value lansdowne will continue to meet with the company and monitor developments to assess changes in the company’s approach should concerns persist lansdowne may seek to intervene formally through written letters addressed to the appropriate company board or committee members in addition lansdowne will consider whether it would be more effective to intervene jointly with other institutions but will only do so where this is considered appropriate and in the best interest of its clients and where it is felt management are not maximising shareholder value lansdowne acknowledges that a variety of factors will make each situation unique and therefor the approach taken to escalation of concerns will vary on a case by case basis  in general lansdowne is unlikely to make public statements submit resolutions or requisition an egm or shareholder proposal lansdowne typically believes that any escalation is best carried out on a confidential basis principle  institutional investors should be willing to act collectively with other investors where appropriate lansdowne has no objection in principle to collective action by investors and will consider any specific action on a case by case basis subject to regulatory restraints company strategy or governance however in normal circumstances lansdowne will tend to act on its own when engaging with or expressing concerns to investee companies whilst lansdowne may communicate with other shareholders regarding a specific proposal it will not agree to vote in concert with another shareholder without approval from lansdowne’s chief compliance officer other investors wishing to approach lansdowne should contact lansdowne’s chief compliance officer hugh orange using the following contact details email financeandcompliancelansdownepartnerscom telephone     principle  institutional investors should have a clear policy on voting and disclosure of voting activity lansdowne maintains proxy voting policies and procedures that are designed to ensure that it makes a best efforts attempt to vote proxies in the best interests of its clients and will always seek to vote all of its shares lansdowne generally votes in favour of routine corporate housekeeping proposals including election of directors where no corporate governance issues are involved for other proposals lansdowne will assess what is in the best interests of its clients and in doing so may take into account the following factors • whether the proposal was recommended by management and lansdowne’s opinion of management • whether the proposal acts to entrench existing management• whether the proposal fairly compensates management for past and future performance and • the proxy voting research provided by iss to the investment teams before shareholder meetingslansdowne does not publicly disclose voting records as it considers that such information belongs to its clients on whose behalf it has voted and not the general public lansdowne generally does not lend securities on behalf of its clientsprinciple  institutional investors should report periodically on their stewardship and voting activities subject to underlying client confidentiality and investment strategy reasons where requested or as required by law lansdowne may disclose to a client ie a segregated managed account or the governing body of a pooled fund or a client’s fiduciaries the manner in which lansdowne exercised voting rights on behalf of the client the information reported frequency and format used will be as agreed between lansdowne and the respective client where acting as investment manager to a pooled fund lansdowne will not typically disclose voting actions at a detailed level to the underlying investors in the pooled fund as this may result in inappropriate disclosure of confidential and sensitive portfolio position information however on request lansdowne may provide to such underlying investors summary details of how it has voted ie with company names redacted in addition lansdowne may on request provide other details of its engagement approach and activities such as number of company meetings held or examples of any concerns raised to clients and underlying investors it is not lansdowne’s policy to publically disclose such records lansdowne believes that this is an appropriate level of transparency designed to promote effective stewardship and assist evaluation by asset owners whilst recognising that disclosure of confidential portfolio information including as mentioned above may in some circumstances be inappropriate and counterproductive lansdowne’s processes relating to its corporate governance activities are included within the scope of annual internal controls testing performed by an independent accounting firm which lansdowne has engaged to perform an outsourced internal audit function the results of such testing are not generally made available but clients wishing to obtain further information should

“partnership” is regulated in the uk by the financial conduct authority the “fca” and is classified as a collective portfolio management investment firm the partnership is a member of a uk consolidation group which also includes its first corporate member lansdowne partners limited the information provided in this document has been prepared on a consolidated basis for this group the “firm” the pillar  disclosure requirement stems from the uk’s crd iii implementing regulations which represented the european union’s application of the basel capital accord the firm is no longer formally subject to capital requirements directive crd but remain subject to the uk’s implementation regulations of crd iii the crd introduced consistent capital adequacy standards and an associated supervisory framework in the eu based the directive introduced into the uk by the fca consists of three ‘pillars’  pillar   this specifies the minimum capital requirements which the uk consolidation group of which the partnership is a member is required to hold  pillar   this supervisory review process requires an assessment to be made of whether additional capital should be held against risks not covered by pillar   pillar   this introduces public disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information and is designed to promote market discipline by providing market participants with key information on a firm’s risk exposures and risk management processes the disclosures below are the required pillar  disclosures the disclosures do not apply to the funds managed the partnership which are exposed to different risks the firm is a full scope uk aifm of noneea aifs and also undertakes additional activities which result in the firm being a bipru firm the firm is required to disclose its risk management objectives and policies for each separate category of risk which include the strategies and processes to manage those risks the structure and organisation of the relevant risk management function or other appropriate arrangement the scope and nature of risk reporting and measurement systems and the policies for hedging and mitigating risk and the strategies and processes for monitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges and mitigants ii risk management objectives and policies the firm maintains a clear delineation between investment management teams and the business management team the members of the firm’s management committee determine and outline the firm’s business strategy as part of this process they consider the firm’s risk appetite to ensure that the firm’s risk management framework is appropriately designed and implemented the firm’s risk oversight committee including the firm’s chairman chief operating officer chief financial and compliance officer and head of risk is responsible for overseeing and supervising the risk management function the risk oversight committee and key members of the firm’s operations and business management teams meet on a regular basis to discuss and identify any potential risks that the firm faces operational risk operational risk is overseen by the risk oversight committee and is primarily the responsibility of the business management team the firm maintains an operational risk policy  framework including a detailed risk map that identifies the risks faced by the firm and the mitigating factors and controls that address these risks each risk is assigned a level of impact and probability of either high medium high medium low or low the firm aims to ensure that there are sufficient mitigating factors and controls to ensure that the net probability of each risk is low the risks map is reviewed and approved by the firm’s risk committee on a quarterly basis it is the responsibility of the compliance  risk team to monitor the effectiveness of the mitigating controls the firm has also engaged an independent accounting firm to undertake annual testing of the internal control environment business risk the firm has identified the key business risks as principally taking the form of a fall in the assets under management or the loss of key staff which may reduce the fee income earned and hinder its ability to meet its expenses to mitigate business risks the finance team periodically models various different economic scenarios to assess the potential impact that these would have on the firm’s financial position the exposure to these business risks is to some extent mitigated by having i distinct and diversified strategies managed by  separate investment teams ii appropriate staff retention policies and iii broad investor base with no reliance on key investors market risk market risk is limited to exposure to foreign currency balances foreign currency balances are limited to fees due that are received in us dollars and euros before they are converted into sterling foreign currency balances are monitored and converted as appropriate credit risk the firm’s exposure to credit risk is principally the risk that investment management fees cannot be collected and the exposure to banks where collected fees are deposited the firm follows the standardised approach for the assessment of both market risk and credit risk using a simplified approach to calculate risk weights for credit risk exposures iii capital resources the firm is not required to calculate an operational risk charge for its pillar  requirement under applicable exemptions as a collective portfolio management investment firm the firm’s minimum capital requirement under pillar  is therefore the greatest of  the base capital requirement of €  the sum of its market and credit risk requirements and  its fixed overhead requirement in practice the fixed overhead requirement is the greatest and therefore establishes the firm’s minimum capital requirement under pillar  the firm assesses the adequacy of its capital through its internal capital adequacy assessment process as part of this process the firm assesses all known risks including operational and business risks and performs stress and scenario tests to determine whether the level of capital that the firm holds is adequate to support its current and future activities following this analysis it is the firm’s opinion that no additional capital is currently required the firm’s regulatory capital on a consolidated basis as at  december  consists of the following capital item £ tier  capital less innovative tier  capital  total of tier  innovative tier  and tier  capital  deductions from tier  and tier  capital  total capital resources net of deductions    the firm does not hold any equities other than those considered immaterial does not have a trading book and does not undertake any form of securitisation the firm’s capital resources requirement consists of its fixed overhead requirement and not the total of the credit risk and market risk requirements therefore disclosures relating to credit and market risk are considered to be immaterial iv remuneration the firm’s remuneration and management committee are responsible for setting and implementing the firm’s remuneration policy during this process and when setting individual remuneration awards the remuneration and management committee would seek input from key business units including business management risk oversight and compliance in addition the firm seeks advice from external consultants where appropriate the firm acknowledges the following general principles  remuneration policies and practices should be consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management and not encourage risktaking which is inconsistent with the risk profile of the funds the partnership manages   remuneration policy should be in line with the business strategy objectives values and interests of the firm and the funds it managers or the investors in such funds and include measures to avoid conflicts of interest   the firm’s total variable remuneration should not limit the firm’s ability to strengthen its capital base  where the firm’s financial performance is subdued or negative total variable remuneration should generally be considerably contracted taking into account both current remuneration and reductions in payouts of amounts previously earned the firm’s performance appraisal process includes an assessment of both financial and nonfinancial performance metrics nonfinancial factors considered include staff’s adherence to lansdowne policies and procedures ethics culture and risk management framework regard is also given to assess performance in a multiyear timeframe where this is appropriate discretionary bonuses will be as determined by the remuneration committee the factors used in setting such bonuses

always seek to vote all of its shares lansdowne generally votes in favour of routine corporate housekeeping proposals including election of directors where no corporate governance issues are involved for other proposals lansdowne will assess what is in the best interests of its clients and in doing so may take into account the following factors • whether the proposal was recommended by management and lansdowne’s opinion of management • whether the proposal acts to entrench existing management• whether the proposal fairly compensates management for past and future performance and • the proxy voting research provided by iss to the investment teams before shareholder meetingslansdowne does not publicly disclose voting records as it considers that such information belongs to its clients on whose behalf it has voted and not the general public lansdowne generally does not lend securities on behalf of its clientsprinciple  institutional investors should report periodically on their stewardship and voting activities subject to underlying client confidentiality and investment strategy reasons where requested or as required by law lansdowne may disclose to a client ie a segregated managed account or the governing body of a pooled fund or a client’s fiduciaries the manner in which lansdowne exercised voting rights on behalf of the client the information reported frequency and format used will be as agreed between lansdowne and the respective client where acting as investment manager to a pooled fund lansdowne will not typically disclose voting actions at a detailed level to the underlying investors in the pooled fund as this may result in inappropriate disclosure of confidential and sensitive portfolio position information however on request lansdowne may provide to such underlying investors summary details of how it has voted ie with company names redacted in addition lansdowne may on request provide other details of its engagement approach and activities such as number of company meetings held or examples of any concerns raised to clients and underlying investors it is not lansdowne’s policy to publically disclose such records lansdowne believes that this is an appropriate level of transparency designed to promote effective stewardship and assist evaluation by asset owners whilst recognising that disclosure of confidential portfolio information including as mentioned above may in some circumstances be inappropriate and counterproductive lansdowne’s processes relating to its corporate governance activities are included within the scope of annual internal controls testing performed by an independent accounting firm which lansdowne has engaged to perform an outsourced internal audit function the results of such testing are not generally made available but clients wishing to obtain further information should contact lansdowne’s chief compliance officer we believe this is an appropriate level of independent assurance ﻿ lansdowne
