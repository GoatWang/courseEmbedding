executive officer century bancorp editors’ note barry sloane has been a director of the company and century bank and trust company since  he is president and ceo of century bancorp and president and ceo of century bank and trust company sloane is also chair  treasurer of the fisher center at rockefeller university a trustee of the massachusetts general hospital and a trustee of the savings bank employee retirement system sbera company brief century bancorp inc centurybankcom through its subsidiary bank century bank and trust company is a statechartered fullservice commercial bank operating  branches in the greater boston area and offering a complete range of business personal and institutional services what is the heritage of century bancorp and how has it evolved century bank was founded by my father marshall in  he still comes to work almost every day we’re proud of him and his legacy and my sister linda and i carry that legacy on we are the largest familycontrolled bank remaining in new england – we’re about  billion today and we have  branch offices in eastern massachusetts there is a dichotomy now in the banking business between the giant and the regional institutions there are many differences between them but the distinction that is most apparent is between providing firstrate facetoface service and solely selfservice automation we have tried to offer a worldclass platform for both so we emphasize our peopletopeople service while building as sophisticated an automated platform as any of our peers yet my father sister and i are always completely available to customers simultaneously we run an extremely centralized decisionmaking process for lending and for most customers borrowing is the core of their banking relationship i sign off on every loan at the bank this provides me with a level of understanding and contact with our customers that is unrivalled among our peers following my father’s tradition means we’re here in the office almost all the time we are responsible for understanding people’s needs and acting swiftly on them how do you avoid losing the family feel when you grow to a certain size it is an obsession with us we have  total employees and about  officers and we train them to know that when they see a client problem that needs our involvement they pick up the phone and solve problems quickly in an empowered way you need to have a decisionmaking structure that efficiently profiles credits and gets applications to the decisionmaking level with little delay part of this is the technology platform for receiving applications doing basic analysis on loan applications of all sizes and getting them prepared for a decision at the end of that process it’s still a dedicated banker analyzing a situation and making a quick decision we’re conservative when it comes to lending which is why we avoided the credit crisis almost completely how broad is your client profile we have  client households many for decades there are three businesses here onethird is the traditional and vibrant consumer sector onethird is our lending business to small business middlemarket enterprise and the largest segment now is lending to notforprofit organizations largely education and healthcare and onethird is what we call institutional services payment processing lockbox services and cash management we’re in our fifth record year of assets deposits earnings and loans so we’ve been fortunate one of the key issues now arising is around virtual branches and what those mean device versus facility banker versus facebook my father still feels strongly that people need to see the bank where their money is but we have begun a new effort to explore virtual branches another important technology innovation is the video teller machine a large atm that includes a video communication capability potentially a huge lineextension for geography and business hours are you competing against just the regional players or also the larger banks fortunately most of the giants place very little emphasis on the personal relationship by policy they rotate their branch people particularly their branch managers oftentimes in less than a year we take pride in having branch managers in place sometimes for over  years – this is how they get to know their customers and the community it’s all about hiring people who are interested in a career of continuity and geographic permanence incenting and encouraging them and making sure the product specialists have a similar attitude when we see a loan application that isn’t perfect if they’re a good loyal customer we will bend in their direction how have you attracted talent the family feel has been enormously important we have never had a layoff in  years people know when they come here that we will do our best to meet their expectations over the long term and that we will assure them a career of continuity they project that to their clients and they’re proud to be working here and they respect the ethic of serving the communities in which the bank was founded is it sometimes difficult to live up to expectations i walk in very large shoes every day and my mission is not to trip this is a public company but it’s a familycontrolled organization and that means that substantively we need to have a clear understanding of the strategy of the business and its future temperament is critical – those who do well in banking have the right time horizon and the proper understanding of the limits to growth we are a capitalanchored industry and there is nothing more important to the investment community the regulatory overseers and ultimately to our clients than that we are wellcapitalized at all times as we are we understand the pace of the growth process i have grown up with it how important is community engagement for the bank we have a large philanthropic effort which is very relationshipbased we’re fortunate to have over  significant charitable organizations that bank with us and we try to reciprocate those relationships appropriately the marvel of greater boston in  is that it’s such a diversified city and philanthropy crosses all income ethnic and religious lines are there opportunities to broaden into new markets the best growth for us is organic and the best markets at this time are those we’re in geographically we’re not interested in growing our footprint outside of driving distance to boston because that’s the basis of our marketing efficiency over the past few decades the number of independent banks has shrunk dramatically but we think there will always be a place for persontoperson service supported by a firstrate technology platform• click here to download a pdf of an
