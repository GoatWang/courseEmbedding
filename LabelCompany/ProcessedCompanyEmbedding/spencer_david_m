david m spencer david m spencer has filed for patents to protect the following inventions this listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the united states patent and trademark office uspto medical treatment system and methods using a plurality of fluid lines publication number 0 abstract a medical treatment system such as peritoneal dialysis system may include control and other features to enhance patient comfort and ease of use for example a peritoneal dialysis system may include a control system that can adjust the volume of fluid infused into the peritoneal cavity to prevent the intraperitoneal fluid volume from exceeding a predetermined amount the control system can adjust by adding one or more therapy cycles allowing for fill volumes during each cycle to be reduced the control system may continue to allow the fluid to drain from the peritoneal cavity as completely as possible before starting the next therapy cycle the control system may also adjust the dwell time of fluid within the peritoneal cavity during therapy cycles in order to complete a therapy within a scheduled time period type application filed

fellows of harvard college inventors gerald r crabtree stuart l schreiber david m spencer thomas j wandless peter belshaw regulated apoptosis using chemically induced dimerization of apoptosis factors publication number  abstract the present invention discloses artificial death switches adss based on chemically induced dimerization of the cysteine proteases caspase ice and caspase yama in both cases aggregation of the target protein is achieved by a nontoxic lipidpermeable dimeric fk0 analog that binds to an attached fk0binding protein fkbp the intracellular crosslinking of caspase or caspase is sufficient to trigger rapid apoptosis in a bclxlindependent manner suggesting that these conditional proapoptotic molecules can bypass intracellular checkpoint genes like bclxl that limit apoptosis since these chimeric molecules are derived from autologous proteins they should be nonimmunogenic and thus ideal for longlived gene therapy vectors these properties should also make chemicallyinduced apoptosis cia useful for developmental studies for treating hyperproliferative disorders and for developing animal models to a wide variety of diseases type application filed

received the award for his work on developing a novel immune therapybased approach to treating cancer which relies on a smallmolecule dimerizer to improve dendritic cell dc function in one iteration they used the chemically induced dimerization cid technology he coinvented years earlier to manipulate the costimulatory cd molecule in dcs leading to a much more potent vaccine against poorly immunogenic selfpeptides in a complementary approach his group developed a novel potent constitutive akt allele and applied this technology to extending the lifespan and potency of dcs in several vaccine models after demonstrating equally impressive potency in human dcs dr spencer initiated collaborations with colleagues on related clinical studies dr spencer also developed a series of stateoftheart nonimmunogenic suicide genes for gene therapy which utilize endogenous caspase family proteases and cid technology these inducible caspases are likely to become increasingly important as a safety switch for retrovirusbased gene therapy and are the basis of upcoming clinical studies the spencer lab has used these conditional proapoptotic molecules as part of a potent novel neoadjuvant

bellicum pharmaceuticals inc announced today the appointment of david m spencer phd to chief scientific officer dr spencer a cofounder of bellicum joins the company from baylor college of medicine where he was vice chairman of pathology and immunology dr spencer is the coinventor of chemical induction of dimerization cid a technology used to control a wide range of biologic functions in cells and applied in the company’s two lead product candidates “we’re pleased to have david join bellicum and bring with him a singularly unique knowledge of the science behind our products” commented tom farrell ceo of bellicum pharmaceuticals “i look forward to his many contributions as we evaluate two new potentially breakthrough product candidates” dr spencer received the michael e debakey md excellence in research award from baylor college of medicine in  for his work developing a novel immune therapybased approach to treating cancer which relies on a smallmolecule cid to improve dendritic cell function in one iteration dr spencer’s team used cid technology which he coinvented to create a much more potent vaccine against poorly immunogenic selfpeptides dr spencer also developed a series of stateoftheart nonimmunogenic suicide genes for gene therapy which utilize endogenous caspase family proteases and cid technology these inducible caspases are likely to become increasingly important as a safety switch for retrovirusbased gene therapy and cellular therapies in general this technology is the basis of two bellicum clinical programs including caspacide™ for the management of graftversushost disease gvhd phase  results from an ongoing clinical trial of caspacide were published in the new england journal of medicine in november of last year the study reported that the “suicide gene” effectively caused the rapid and complete reversal of gvhd in acute leukemia patients who underwent stem cell transplant dr spencer earned his phd from the massachusetts institute of technology and completed his postdoctoral degree at stanford university about bellicum pharmaceuticals bellicum pharmaceuticals inc is developing clinical applications of chemical induction of dimerization cid a drugbased remote control technology that extends the physician’s reach beyond the point at which a treatment has been administered bellicum’s mission is to leverage this smart technology to bring safe effective innovative cell therapies to market for patients with serious and life threatening diseases the company’s decide™ vaccines are designed to kill targeted cells by inducing a potent durable fully activated antigenspecific t cell immune response lead product bpx an autologous decide vaccine is in clinical development for patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer mcrpc caspacide™ is a cell therapy safety switch permitting the rapid elimination of cells in the event of toxicity caspacide dli is a donor lymphocyte infusion administered following a hematopoietic stem cell transplant in which the safety switch may be activated to resolve graftversushost disease gvhd for more information visit wwwbellicumcom david m spencer phd
