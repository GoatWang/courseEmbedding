american children with scd receive critical treatment to ease their symptoms and prolong their lives as a testament to early screening and medical advances there are now an estimated  americans living with scd that is great news more sobering is the fact that they incur medical costs of more than  billion a yearthat kind of money—let alone the ability to even detect the disease in its newborns—is unrealistic in countries where most scd cases occur while there are high scd incidence rates in india the caribbean central america and south america subsaharan africa is especially hard pressed with

academicindustrygovernment partnership to establish screening laboratories and provide training to lab and medical professionals in the city of luanda on effective screening procedures and simple highly effective interventions that are saving countless lives“we spent a lot of time building capacity” dr ware says “we trained angolan medical technicians in how to use ief equipment from perkinelmer which was very reliable robust and easy to use” that proved to be significant “maternity hospitals in angola are very rapid turnaround where women give birth and are released within six hours” dr ware says so the durability and easeof use of the equipment were essential to the pilot project’s success thanks to perkinelmer’s continuing collaboration the angolan team processed over

as well so far the sickle cell lab has conducted over  screens “because of this remarkable partnership we got the staff trained and the lab up and running very quickly” dr ware says adding that he
