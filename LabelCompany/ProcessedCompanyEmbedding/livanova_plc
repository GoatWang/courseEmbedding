for transmission of microbial agents associated with heatercooler devices and has collaborated with professional societies public health partners and experts to develop strategies to minimize patient exposurea european study published in april  describes a link between m chimaera clinical samples from several european infected cardiothoracic patients samples from the heatercooler devices used during these patients procedures and environmental samples from the device manufacturers production and servicing facility in germany the results of this paper suggest a direct link between the m chimaera that infected european patients during openchest cardiac surgery and the m chimaera isolated from the t heatercooler model utilized during these patients surgeriesm chimaera is a type of nontuberculous mycobacterium ntm classified as a slow grower m chimaera may cause serious illness or death the fda believes m chimaera infections associated with the t are rare  however they are difficult to detect because infected patients may not develop symptoms or signs of infection for months to years after initial exposureon june   the fda issued a safety communication specific to m chimaera infections associated with the use of the t testing conducted by the manufacturer in august  found m chimaera contamination on the production line and water supply at the t manufacturing facility the t devices manufactured at this facility were distributed worldwide in response to the m chimaera findings in august  the manufacturer added cleaning and disinfection procedures to the production line in september  samples taken at the same manufacturing facility by the german regulatory authorities in july  did not show m chimaera potentially indicating the contamination at the manufacturing facility had been resolved although the manufacturer of t devices added cleaning and disinfection procedures to the production line in september  the fda is now aware of some t devices manufactured after september  which have tested positive for m chimaera it has not been confirmed whether these devices were contaminated at the manufacturing facility or became contaminated at the user facility to date the fda is not aware of m chimaera patient infections associated with t devices that were manufactured after september the june   safety communication also stated the fda received reports of us patients infected with m chimaera after undergoing cardiothoracic surgery that involved use of the t devices each of those reports related to t devices that were manufactured prior to september   the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in conjunction with national jewish health has performed whole genome sequencing on clinical isolates from infected patients and samples taken from the t devices from hospitals representing geographically distinct regions within the us pennsylvania and iowa where clusters of patient infections with m chimaera were identified each of the isolates tested were associated with devices manufactured before september  samples of the water drained from the t devices and air samples collected while the devices were in operation were also tested the results obtained strongly suggest that the tested t devices had a common source of m chimaera contamination sequence comparisons between us and european union eu samples as well as samples from the manufacturing site would provide additional information in evaluating the potential for point source contamination at the production site however eu sequencing results have not been shared to dateas new information becomes available the fda will evaluate the information and update its recommendations as appropriateupdated recommendations for health care facilities and

since this may introduce ntm organisms use only sterile water or water that has been passed through a filter of less than or equal to  microns when making ice needed for patient cooling during surgical procedures use only sterile water or water that has been passed through a filter of less than or equal to  microns deionized water and sterile water created through reverse osmosis is not recommended because it may promote corrosion of the metal components of the systemdirect the heatercoolers vent exhaust away from the surgical field to mitigate the risk of aerosolizing heatercooler tank water into the sterile field and exposing the patientestablish regular cleaning disinfection and maintenance schedules for heatercooler devices according to the manufacturers instructions to minimize the risk of bacterial growth and subsequent patient infectiondevelop and follow a comprehensive quality control program for maintenance cleaning and disinfection of heatercooler devices your
