independently and updated annually the living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living using the ‘minimum income standard’ for the uk decisions about what to include in this standard are set by the public it is a social consensus about what people need to make ends meet employers choose to pay the living wage on a voluntary basis the living wage enjoys cross party support with public backing from the prime minister and the leader of the opposition our investment services infoveritasinvestmentcouk tel      our investment services investment services our investment approach client services and reporting investment services we manage investments on a discretionary basis for uk and international private investors trusts and charities with a minimum of £m or currency equivalent  typically we invest directly in individual global securities  each client has an investment manager responsible for their portfolio  we do not employ relationship managers because we think it is important that clients speak directly to the person who is making the investment decisions  the investment managers are supported by a portfolio assistant  they are a key point of contact for any administrative matters and are in constant communication with the custodian our investment approach we have a longterm real return investment focus which aligns our investment process and selection with our clients’ objectives and goals  the result of this philosophy is that in individual years we do and will have significant differences against indices and “passive” managers  however our investment record demonstrates that we have delivered consistent riskadjusted longterm real returns for our clients we invest globally on a best ideas unindexed basis we believe that as investors we should seek global opportunities for real returns rather than focusing on any specific country or region given businesses increasingly operate in global context  the location of a stock market listing is less relevant today given that borders are blurring we aim to find companies where structural shifts are creating demand for their products or services while economic cycles are almost impossible to predict structural growth can be both longterm in nature and relatively insulated from the economic cycle indeed companies that benefit from structural shifts should be able to consistently grow their earnings and cash flow per share over a multiyear period irrespective of the economic environment provided you buy that company’s equity at a sensible valuation you are likely to have a successful longterm investment that delivers a real return  should we not be able to find equities which we believe will provide real returns or worse are overvalued and might expose the client to meaningful loss in the medium to long term we would be prepared to remain heavily in cash andor investment grade bonds client services and reporting our service and reporting to our clients takes two forms written and personal  we recommend meeting clients at least once a year to discuss the portfolio however we are delighted to meet more frequently if required performance statistics valuations with bank statements and transaction details prepared by the custodian are generally sent out quarterly  our market musings published each quarter sets out our current investment views and strategy veritas investment management infoveritasinvestmentcouk tel      real return investment we are a successful independent investment boutique managing portfolios for uk and international private investors trusts and charities  we are independently owned by the partners and employees  since our foundation in  we have focused on a single objective – protecting and growing the real value
