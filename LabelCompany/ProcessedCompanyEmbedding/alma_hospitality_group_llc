bookings one of the biggest challenges faced by independent hotels is trying to maximize direct bookings online travel agencies otas like orbitz and others serve an important role in funneling new business to hotels but they take a hefty commission in return while we believe this is a key piece of developing a hotel’s customer base it is critical that those guests do not return to the otas for their next booking and if we can get a guest book direct for their first booking that’s even better knowing this charlestowne has made a concerted effort to drive direct bookings up front and convert ota guests into direct booking guests when they return our results speak for themselves based on our internal data compared against nationwide data from smith travel research independent hotels managed by charlestowne hotels earn direct bookings at three times the national average resulting in a mix that is  direct ota independent direct bookingsus industry average  vs charlestowne hotels
