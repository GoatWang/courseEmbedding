broker himself raising  from family and friends rogers started his own investment firm ariel capital management with one other employee in  by  ariel had  employees managed nearly  billion for individuals corporations university endowments and some of the nation’s largest public and private pension funds and was one of the largest blackowned investment firms in the country in addition rogers created the only two mutual funds in the united states managed by african americans rogers was born into a prominent chicago family in  his mother jewel lafontant senior partner in a chicago law firm and longtime figure in national republican politics was named ambassadoratlarge and us coordinator for refugee affairs by president george bush in  john sr a circuit court judge instilled early business sense in his son by giving him shares of stock as christmas and birthday gifts and allowing him a checking account where he could deposit the dividends and his allowance except for one bounced check john jr learned his early financial lessons well soon he was following the newspaper stock tables and watching the stock ticker prices race along the bottom of the television screen on chicago’s local business channel he also spent a lot of time after school in the office of his father’s broker stacy adams one of the first black stockbrokers in chicago at the age of  rogers was hawking hot dogs peanuts and soft drinks during white sox games at comiskey park putting the earnings into more stocks and phoning adams to check on their progress during his work breaks wall street smarts rogers graduated from the highly regarded university of chicago laboratory school in  the same year he played on the illinois class a allstate hall of fame basketball team attending princeton university as an economics major he quickly found a local broker whose enthusiasm convinced him that he too could be successful in the field while in college rogers flew to the west coast to appear on the wheel of fortune winning  in prizes that he immediately invested with his broker at a glance… born march  in chicago il son of john w rogers a judge and jewel s lafontant an attorney and

award association of black princeton alumni  addresses home —chicago il office —ariel capital management inc  n michigan ave suite  chicago il  after graduating from princeton in  rogers went to work as a stockbroker for william blair  company a chicago investment banking firm besides being the first person hired directly out of college by the company in more than four years he was the first black professional ever to work at the employee firm for rogers it was the perfect place to learn his trade the company had everything under one roof—corporate finance public finance trading money management mutual funds and research—and specialized in smallcompany stocks with experience and omnivorous reading of financial newsletters magazines and investment classics like security analysis and a random walk down wall street rogers quickly began to develop his valueoriented investment strategy less than three years later at the age of  he left william blair  company to form ariel capital management named after the fleet and nearly extinct african and asian mountain gazelle starting with only one major account—  worth of howard university’s endowment fund to invest—within six months rogers and an employee had raised an additional  in investment capital from then on ariel capital moved nearly as swiftly as its namesake growing to  million in managed assets by  family ties helped rogers’s rapid rise in the financial world his mother was an early investor and remains partowner of ariel more importantly her business connections helped open doors she was a trustee of howard university and two other corporations where she served on the board of directors revlon and mobil later became ariel clients the firm also landed such accounts as the retirement funds of city employees in chicago detroit los angeles and the district of columbia but connections aside the bottom line is results “our private clients can judge us by just one thing” rogers told forbes “growth of assets” investing over the long haul to that end rogers quickly perfected a creative but conservative investment style best summed up by ariel’s motto borrowed from aesop’s fable about the tortoise “slow and steady wins the race” his overriding philosophy is one of patience timing and making the most out of a down market unlike many investors he has no sophisticated computerized trading programs rogers avoids buying into the current “hot” stock trends of any given moment and he does not look for potential takeover targets with share prices that might quickly jump instead he seeks out lesserknown undervalued companies that produce quality products then invests longterm in their stock intensive research is the key to finding these companies rogers devotes several hours a day to reading five morning newspapers nine business magazines and more than  newsletters including his own entitled the patient investor he likes to concentrate on smaller companies with market capitalization of  million to  billion and good earnings records that “do one thing very very well and have a wellestablished niche” he told financial world many of these firms are too small to be followed by the bigger wall street investors rogers also looks for companies in currently unpopular industries companies experiencing a temporary setback in earnings or companies newly created by spinoffs and asset sales and he aims to find them before they are discovered by other investors other criteria are effective and committed management a clean simple and easilyunderstood balance sheet good cash flow and a low debttocapital ratio “a lot of our work is really tire kicking” he explained in black enterprise “going out and visiting the companies getting to know the employees and management and talking to the customers competitors and suppliers the final judgment is whether there will be longterm demand for that product” rogers expects the earnings of the companies he invests in to grow at a consistent  percent to  percent annually there are several types of companies however that rogers never invests in he stays away from cyclical industries like heavy machinery steel and automobiles because of their frequent ups and downs he avoids all startup companies regardless of their business because they have no track record commodity stocks like precious metals gas and oil are too volatile for his taste while trucking airline banking and other recently deregulated industries are in his mind still working themselves out in their new environments and therefore are not good buys “we don’t make exceptions” rogers said in changing times “we’re very rigid” socially conscious investments even more important to rogers is his strict code of socially conscious investing he will not buy the stock of any company that does business with south africa nor will he invest in defense contractors nuclear utilities cigarette manufacturers and companies that make weapons or harm the environment “the principles just make investment sense” he told fortune magazine “many defense companies are too reliant upon big government contracts this reliance pressures management into doing unethical things to get and keep those contracts” he explained “i don’t own nuclear utilities because i don’t like investing in companies that the courts might put out of business the same goes for cigarette makers i don’t want to invest in a business everyone is trying to outlaw” in fact when kraft one of rogers’s corporate clients became a part of tobacco manufacturing giant philip morris companies inc he terminated business with them documented success rogers’s patient disciplined approach has worked some of his earlier successes included investments in companies that manufacture toothbrushes hospital uniforms desktop stacking trays plastic binders baseball cards and milkshake machines and he has also been known to take advantage of a down market investing for instance  million in caesar’s world the hotel and gambling casino firm when its stock hit a low of  per share during the october  stock market crash by july of  caesar’s price per share had risen  percent “ariel is one of the few managers dealing with the middlesize unknown basicbusiness type of company and those companies are the ones that have led the stock market charge since the crash” edward g lloyd former senior vicepresident of the united negro college fund uncf said in business week the uncf was one of rogers’s early clients joining ariel in  and seeing its initial investment grow by  percent over the next four years rogers claims similar results for his other  bigmoney institutional clients which have included chrysler ford procter  gamble att pillsbury sara lee and the stroh brewing company in fact from  to  rogers’s clients saw their total assets rise more than  percent compared to the nearly  percent gain posted by standard  poor’s index of  stocks “we were successful during the ’s because we picked some good reasonably priced small stocks” he told black enterprise “we avoided the gogo glamorous small stocks that soared in  and then plunged by  instead we stuck with lowexpectation stocks that didn’t go up as much but also didn’t suffer as much” mutual funds attracted smaller investors ariel’s institutional clients have average investment accounts of  million to attract smaller investors rogers organized two mutual funds distributed by calvert securities a washington dc firm that markets socially responsible investments the calvertariel growth fund started in  invests in small companies from its inception to  the fund appreciated  percent annually growing to  million in assets placing it sixth among  smallcompany funds followed and ranked by lipper analytical services his newer fund the calvertariel appreciation fund buys stock in companies as large as  billion it grew to  million and gained  percent in value annually from its start in  to  but rogers’s very success has caused problems and forced a change in the way he prefers investing so much new money has flooded his firm and his mutual funds that he can no longer specialize in the smallcompany stocks that made his reputation back in  when he managed only  million rogers could put  to  percent of ariel’s total capital in  or  carefully targeted small companies without disturbing their share price or ending up with too large a percentage of their stock when their share prices rose ariel’s total return appreciated accordingly however as a multibilliondollar money manager since the early s rogers can no longer operate this way his total assets are too large to permit such a concentrated investment strategy among selected small firms without severely jolting their share price as a result he must either scatter his investment portfolio among hundreds of small companies diluting his overall return or focus on much larger firms rogers has tried to steer a middle course telling forbes in  “we can’t take on any more new cash and still preserve our focus” he stopped seeking institutional clients and closed the calvertariel growth fund to new investors this has allowed him to continue pursuing small companies while simultaneously investing in larger more wellknown firms like clorox hasbro and the fleming companies thoughts on minorityowned businesses but the spotlight will be on rogers as he tries to walk this investment tightrope because of the performance standards he has set and the pioneering role model ariel has become as one of the black leaders in the financial world “the fortress of finance was one of the last to give way” he told changing times in  “but not a week goes by without the press reporting the creation of a new firm by minorities” still only a small fraction of all united states pension assets is managed by firms owned by blacks women hispanics asianamericans native americans and other minorities ariel and w r lazard  company in new york account for more than  billion of that amount nearly half of all the assets managed by blackowned firms to maintain this pacesetting status rogers continues his workaholic sixday weeks to find the necessary time to keep up with all his managerial duties and research responsibilities yet people continue to underestimate him justin f beckett senior vice president of ncm capital management in durham north carolina told black enterprise “they see a mildmannered softspoken person but he is a pure competitor who is out to win” sources black enterprise april  business week july

academic journal article american international college journal of business convergence of business models by rogers john w jr read preview article excerpt abstract this article analyzes ecommerce business models and the costs they incur to build brand awareness and customer loyalty in the new competitive environment of the internet with lower availability of capital these costs represent an important area of weakness for new ecommerce ventures some firms have been successful in addressing the issue with the technique of viral marketing this approach uses personal relationships and referrals to build affinity groups that support and promote new brands without the costly expenditure of traditional media advertising the approach capitalizes on many of the same dynamics as direct selling and network marketing  the leveraging of personal relationships and word of mouth recommendations to build customer awareness and loyalty the article analyzes the parallels between the widely accepted business model of direct selling particularly as it has been updated during the s into network marketing and the new model of ecommerce it suggests opportunities for ecommerce to learn from and incorporate key features of this welltested approach to building a brand through personal circles of influence introduction the collapse of the nasdaq beginning in the first quarter of  and the subsequent failure of many dot com enterprises has called into question the validity and substance of the business model that many of these firms used to launch what they trumpeted as the ecommerce revolution it also raises the larger question of how businesses will realistically exploit the undeniable potential of internet technology traditional retailers can profitably use the internet as a new channel to build incremental volume mass merchandisers like walmart and sears who operate across a broad product range as well as focused marketers like the pottery barn l l bean and the gap have all built powerful click and mortar business models that supplement and complement sales in stores and mail order the internet has also proven to be a powerful tool in supply chain management for firms selling to the corporate bb market but the heart of the ecommerce revolution  using on line sales to replace traditional marketing channels at a lower cost with more customization and higher levels of customer convenience  has not produced a business model that allows firms to translate internet productivity into profits technology empowers consumers with a much broader range of information and gives firms access to more consumers at dramatically lower cost and higher frequency but until it generates profits as well as page views the internet will not realize its potential to improve lives no profits no progress the quest for a viable ecommerce business model is in full swing this paper analyzes the current first generation business models used in ecommerce considering them from a microeconomic viewpoint why has the rapid growth of on line marketing  approaching one trillion dollars in the united states and projected to double by   generated little or no profit even for the market leaders it is necessary to look at the cost of attracting customers and more importantly of securing repeat business the structure of the market the experience of the first generation firms competing in this market and the basic cost dynamics are key to uncovering the weakness of this dot com business model by comparing the dot com experience with other industries where technology has taken off rapidly and with other marketing plans the paper seeks to shed light on other approaches to entrepreneurship and business building that may have relevance to ecommerce the market structure of the internet economy approaches the economic model of perfect competition characterized by low barriers to entry and exit with a consequent proliferation of firms and products rapid diffusion of knowledge to both consumers and competitors low product or service differentiation and brand loyalty … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over
