larger more established companies also the fund�s broad diversification may make it less volatile than midcap growth funds that have more concentrated portfolios in addition portfolio turnover should be relatively low which may reduce the investor�s potential capital gains tax exposurethe fund�s share price can fall because of weakness in the broad market a particular industry or specific holdings investing in midcap companies involves greater risk than is customarily associated with larger companies in addition growth stocks can be volatile especially if they lack the dividends usually associated with value stocks that can cushion their decline in a falling market finally the fund�s investment approach could fall out of favor with the investing public resulting in lagging performance versus other types of stock funds diversification cannot assume a profit or protect against loss in a declining market this chart displays relative risk of each us mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart methodology we evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific riskreturn category on an annual basis a fund is generally placed in a riskreturn category based on the year standard deviation of its performance if a fund is less than  years old the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years for an asset allocation fund with less than  years of performance history substrategy returns are used when a substrategy is less than  years old the actual substrategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years risk return categories overlap a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories denoted by a plus  is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of t rowe price when a fund has a cashlike benchmark denoted by a double plus  its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns if the fund is less than  years old benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate all investments are subject to market risk including the possible loss of principal standard deviation of returns a measure of price volatility is one
