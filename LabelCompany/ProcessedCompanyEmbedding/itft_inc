lower costs itft has no customers or sales and will require a great deal more money to finish its product development and sales and marketing efforts  it may not have enough money to be able to become profitable the patented technology appears to offer some advantages and features that its competitors lack there are many competitors most of who are far larger than itft have far greater financial and technological resources as well as customers and revenue the advisory team has significant experience in startups technology and financial matters itft needs to continue its technology development as well as protecting its intellectual property  if a competitor violated itft’s intellectual property or claimed that itft violated their intellectual property itft likely would not have the resources to protect itself itft could be subject to significant regulatory or legal risks from people using their device especially if the device provides incorrect information and leads to recalls or lawsuits management has no experience with startups and little business experience in general  the ceo is also the only voting shareholder and board member valuation is very high  if they raise
