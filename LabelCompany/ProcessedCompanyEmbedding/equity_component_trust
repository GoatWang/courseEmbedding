brand equity refers to a value premium that a company generates from a product with a recognizable name when compared to a generic equivalent companies can create brand equity for their products by making them memorable easily recognizable and superior in quality and reliability mass marketing campaigns also help to create brand equity breaking down brand equity brand equity has three basic components consumer perception negative or positive effects and the resulting value first and foremost brand equity is built by consumer perception which includes both knowledge and experience with a brand and its products the perception that a consumer segment holds about a brand directly results in either positive or negative effects if the brand equity is positive the organization its products and its financials can benefit if the brand equity is negative the opposite is truefinally these effects can turn into either tangible or intangible value if the effect is positive tangible value is realized as increases in revenue or profits and intangible value is realized as marketing as awareness or goodwill if the effects are negative the tangible or intangible value is also negative for example if consumers are willing to pay more for a generic product than for a branded one the brand is said to have negative brand equity this might happen if a company has a major product recall or causes a widely publicized environmental disastergeneral example of brand equitya general example of a situation where brand equity is important is when a company wants to expand its product line if the brands equity is positive the company can increase the likelihood that customers might buy its new product by associating the new product with an existing successful brand for example if campbells releases a new soup the company is likely to keep it under the same brand name rather than inventing a new brand the positive associations customers already have with campbells make the new product more enticing than if the soup has an unfamiliar brand namespecific example of brand equitybrand equity is a major indicator of company strength and performance specifically in the public markets often times companies in the same industry or sector compete on brand equity for example an equitrend survey conducted on july   found that the home depot was the number one hardware company in terms of brand equity lowes companies inc came in second with the ace hardware corporation scoring below averagea large component of brand equity in the hardware environment is consumer perception of the strength of a companys ecommerce business the home depot is an industry leader in this category it was also found that in addition to ecommerce the home depot has the highest familiarity among consumers allowing it to further penetrate the industry and increase its brand equity trading center brand management brand brand identity brand personality brand loyalty brand awareness private brand

supportand brand extension opportunitiesgiven this interest in brand building what actually makes abrand strong this question has been a signiﬁcant andrecurrent theme in the branding literature over the past twodecades resulting in a vast body of research on the salientconcept of brand equity however since the late s newresearch streams in marketing eg longterm relationshipsthe creation of added value based on knowledge andexperience the role of marketing resources in ﬁrmperformance etc have allowed for a new way ofapproaching the question of what makes a brand strongthereby enriching our understanding of brand equityspeciﬁcally it is within a resourcebased approach andrelationship marketing perspective that we analyze brandequitythe most recent literature falkenberg  hooley et al srivastava et al   considers brand equity asa relational marketbased asset because it exists outside theﬁrm and resides in the relationships of ﬁnal users with brandsat the same time the emergence of relationship marketing asa dominant focus of both marketing theorists andpractitioners suggests that trust is the main factor on whicha relationship is based connecting then the relationshipprinciples with a resourcebased approach to brand equity wepropose the following research question does brand trustmatter to brand equitythe study of brand trust in the branding literature has notﬂourished much of the interest in this issue has beenconceptual or theoretical in nature and there has been littleempirical research into it this lack of research is pointed outby chaudhuri and holbrook  who afﬁrm that the roleof brand trust in the brand equity processes has not beenexplicitly considered nevertheless its importance has beentheoretically highlighted in the branding literature seeambler  sheth and parvatiyar  and in thecurrent brand management practices see bainbridge kamp  scott on the basis of these considerations and connecting boththe resourcebased approach of the ﬁrm and the relationshipmarketing literatures this study aims to ﬁll this gap byexamining the importance of brand trust in the developmentof brand equityto address this objective the rest of this paper is thereforeorganized as follows we begin by analyzing brand equity froma resourcebased approach its consideration as a relationalmarketbased asset leads us to focus on brand trustconsequently we present

we discuss the manner in which brand trust contributes to thedevelopment of brand equity based on this discussion atheoretical model of brand equity is proposed and the mainhypotheses of this study are presented subsequently the datacollection the method used to test the hypotheses and theresults are described finally we discuss the results in termsof their implications for managerial practice their limitationsand directions for further research on the branding literaturebrand equity as a relational marketbased asseta ﬁrm’s survival and wealth is determined by its ability tocreate a superior value to the market from a resourcebasedview of the ﬁrm the sources of wealth creation are found inthe resources endowment that enable the ﬁrm to efﬁcientlyandor effectively produce a market offering that has value forsome market segments hunt and morgan  by doingso the ﬁrm achieves superior ﬁnancial performance that isreﬂected in higher dividends and value of stocks falkenbergthere is a growing recognition regarding the resources inwhich this superior ﬁnancial performance lies that asigniﬁcant proportion of organizational performance isdetermined by intangible assets such as the quality andexperience of personnel corporate culture knowledge brandequity and so forth falkenberg  lusch and harvey srivastava et al  as with other intangible assetsbrand equity exhibits the qualities required for creating asustainable competitive advantage it adds value forcustomers helps to create defensible competitive positionstakes time to develop is inherently complex and cannot beeasily transferred to other organizations de chernatony andmacdonald  therefore its value as an asset isreﬂected in superior ﬁnancial performance in so it leads tohigher margins farquhar  greater sales and marketshares hooley et al  park and srinivasan advertising and promotions that are more responsive keller earlier market penetration robertson  andcheaper product line extensions keller and aaker  asa consequence a positive inﬂuence of brand equity on theﬁrm value has also been found by simon and sullivan the most recent literature hunt  srivastava et al  speciﬁcally characterizes brand equity as arelational marketbased asset it is primarily relationalbecause according to the branding literature aaker keller  much of its value is a result of the brand’sexternal relationships with other members of the value chaineg the distribution system and the ﬁnal users thisrelational nature makes brand equity be an external asset tothe ﬁrm because it is often merely “available” and not“owned” by the ﬁrm in other words brand equity ultimatelyderives in the market place from the set of brand associationsand behaviors that have been developed towards the brandin summary as a relational marketbased asset brandequity may be expressed as a function of brandconsumerrelationships ambler  and as such the introduction oftrust as a key relational variable enriches our understanding ofbrand equity and may provide better performance predictionsand assessment of brand equitywhat is brand trusttrust has received a great deal of attention from scholars inseveral disciplines such as psychology sociology economicsas well as in more applied areas such as management andmarketing this multidisciplinary interest has added richnessto the construct but has also made it difﬁcult to integrate thevarious perspectives on trust and to ﬁnd a consensus on itsnature nevertheless a careful review of the extant literaturereveals that conﬁdent expectations and risk are criticalcomponents of a deﬁnition of trust trust therefore isdeﬁned as the conﬁdence that one will ﬁnd what is desiredfrom another rather that what is feared deutsch  itrepresents the conﬁdence that the relational party in anexchange will not exploit another’s vulnerability accordinglyto trust a brand implicitly means that there is a highprobability or expectancy that the brand will result in positiveoutcomes for the consumerconsidering brand trust as expectancy it is based on theconsumer’s belief that the brand has speciﬁc qualities thatmake it consistent competent honest responsible and so onwhich is in line with the research on trust eg andaleeb doney and cannon  larzelere and huston this research suggests that trust is based on thedispositional attributions made to the partner about hisherintentions behaviors and qualities the key issue then is toknow which speciﬁc attributions form brand trustdrawing on the research on brand trust developed bydelgado et al  we consider that these speciﬁcattributions have a technical and intentional nature which isin line with a twodimensional idea of trust more commonlyfound in management and marketing literature see doneyand cannon  ganesan  morgan and hunt therefore the ﬁrst dimension of brand trustreliability has a technical or competencebased natureinvolving the ability and willingness to keep promises andsatisfy consumers’ needs the second dimension intentionscomprises the attribution of good intentions to the brand inrelation to the consumers’ interests and welfare for examplewhen unexpected problems with the product ariseconsequently a trustworthy brand is one that consistentlykeeps its promise of value to consumers through the way theproduct is developed produced sold serviced andadvertised even in bad times when some kind of brandcrisis arisesin summary brand trust is deﬁned as addressed by delgadoet al the conﬁdent expectations of the brand’s reliability and intentionsbrand trust is therefore conceptualized as having two distinctdimensions that reﬂect different perspectives from which abrand may be considered trustworthythe contribution of brand trust to brand equityto accomplish our aim of analyzing the role of brand trust inthe development of brand equity we examine therelationships network in which brand trust is embeddedand speciﬁcally the relationships that have with its mainantecedent and the main asset of brand equity brand loyaltybrand trust evolves from past experience and priorinteraction garbarino and johnson  because itsdevelopment is portrayed most often as an individual’sexperiential process of learning over time therefore itsummarizes the consumers’ knowledge and experiences withthe brand as an experience attribute it is inﬂuenced by theconsumer’s

indirect contact eg advertising word of mouth with thebrand keller  krishnan  among all thesedifferent contacts the consumption experience is the mostrelevant and important source of brand trust because itgenerates associations thoughts and inferences that are moreselfrelevant and held with more certainty dwyer et al krishnan  in this sense it can be postulated that theoverall satisfaction as a general evaluation of theconsumption experience with the brand generates brandtrust ganesan  selnes  this leads us to proposethe following hypothesish the consumer’s overall satisfaction with the brand hasa positive effect on brand trustconsidering brand equity as a relational marketbased assetimplies that building and maintaining trust is at the core ofbrand equity because it is a key characteristic of anysuccessful longterm relationship garbarino and johnson larzelere and huston  morgan and hunt taking into account the conceptual connections ofrelationship aspects and the notion of loyalty fournier andyao  the prevailing idea in these studies chaudhuriand holbrook  delgado et al  garbarino andjohnson  lau and lee  is that trust is the cardinaldriver of loyalty because it creates exchange relationships thatare highly valued in this context brand loyalty does notexclusively focus on repeated purchases but on the internaldispositions or attitude towards the brand the focus onbehavior would otherwise not provide an adequate basis for acomplete understanding of the brandconsumer relationshipconsequently brand loyalty underlies the ongoing process ofcontinuing and maintaining a valued and importantrelationship that has been created by trust chaudhuri andholbrook this is fairly well supported by several authors in thebranding literature for example sheth and parvatiyar assert that the logic behind the existence of the brand is totransmit trust to the market especially when direct contactbetween consumers and companies are not possible anothertelling argument in support of this viewpoint is that theunique value perceived in a brand by consumers may bederived from greater trust in that particular brand that otherbrands do not provide chaudhuri and holbrook from a managerial perspective companies have also begunto consider the idea of wining consumers’ trust in order tobuild a relationship in the consumer market there are toomany anonymous consumers making it unlikely that thecompany could develop personal relationships with each onethus consumers develop a relationship with the brandwhich becomes a substitute for human contact between theorganization and its customers sheth and parvatiyar trust therefore can be developed through this relationshipwith the brand the current practices of companies inmanaging their brands illustrate this idea for examplemacleod  considers that much of the vocabulary ofmodern brand building uses words associated with personalrelationships such as trust and blackston  views trust tobe one component of consumers’ relationships with brandsmore recently hiscock  p  has claimed that “theultimate goal of marketing is to generate an intense bondbetween the consumer and the brand and the mainingredient of this bond is trust”based on these ideas we put forward the hypothesis thatbrand trust will contribute to brand loyalty as the maximumexpression of a successful relationship between the consumerand the brandh the consumer’s trust in a brand has a positive effect onbrand loyaltyfinally one characteristic of brands with high levels of equityis that consumers are very loyal to them in fact brand loyaltyis the main driver of brand equity because it is considered tobe the path that leads to certain marketing advantages andoutcomes eg reduced marketing costs price premiumsmarket share greater trade leverage which have been closelyassociated with brand equity aaker  bello andholbrook  park and srinivasan  therefore wepropose another hypothesis describing the relationshipbetween brand

that brand equity is best explained when brandtrust is taken into account reinforces the idea that brandequity is a relational marketbased asset morgan and hunt proposed that resources such as loyalty

competitive advantages will result some openquestions on this topic warrant further researchfirst stakeholder theory says that the ﬁrm is reliant on anetwork of relations in which it becomes obliged to themembers of this network therefore as a relational marketbased asset the analysis of brand equity must also considerthe relationships with other members of the value chainincluding employees especially in service companiesinvestors or even supplierssecond because there are interconnections amongstakeholders an interesting point is that a ﬁrm might buildup strong brand equity based on the

ofdeparture is to examine the research on consumer brandingtherefore our ﬁndings offer industrial branding researcherssome ideas that can be applied in the industrial sectoron a more general level

thegeneralizability of the results could be extended bybroadening the list of products for example durable goodsand services in which brand trust may be even moreimportant in developing brand equityimplications for practicethis study has several managerial implications regardingbrand equity first in order to enjoy the substantialcompetitive and economic advantages provided by brandequity as a relational marketbased asset companies mustbuild brand trust to that purpose a promisecentric approachis needed when managing the brand it implies to position thebrand as a promise as a set of expectations that the brandoffers a certain type and level of value providing this value ona consistent basis is at the heart of building strongrelationships with consumers because they develop a senseof trust that the brand will continue to deliver that valuewhen this happens the brand can serve as a catalyst forstrengthening the relationship and for forming a bond thatcompetitors will ﬁnd difﬁcult to break this will be thefoundation for the ongoing success and sustained competitiveadvantagehowever companies must take care not to promiseeverything for all people they have to consider their owncapabilities and the desires of their target consumer segmentsbefore deﬁning their promises of value once they are deﬁnedthese promises have to be kept consistently especially whenthings change quickly and buyers face great uncertaintysecond since trust is built through experience the morepositive experiences the consumer has with the brand themore trusting he or she is likely to become as suchinvestments in satisfaction programs complaint handling andin the design of communication and merchandising strategiesthat aid in creating and informing consumers about theresponsive

issue the iraq war how canwe trust him on other important domestic issues theconsensus was that while mr blair’s “brand” was damagedthe damage to the bigger labour “brand” was limitedallowing mr blair to win – albeit with a smaller share of thevotewe know – at least intuitively that the extent to which we“trust” a brand inﬂuences our propensity to purchase thatbrand and this mistrust therefore impacts on brand equityhowever as delgadoballester and munueraaleman pointout there is limited empirical study – and henceunderstanding – of the connection between brand trust andbrand equity we take the relationship on trustkeeping our promisesany brand contains – either implicitly or explicitly – apromise or promises sometimes these promises are tangibleand measurable but more often the promise contains asigniﬁcant element of intangibility when a car manufacturermakes claims about safety these can be substantiated eg as aresult of crash testing and the buyer – one hopes – is notintending to put such claims to deliberate test on the otherhand promises that imply glamour status or other selfimagebeneﬁts are less measurableas brand managers we need to consider the extent to whichour brand promise is realistic and deliverable a trusted brandis one that as the authors here conclude “ that consistentlykeeps its promise of value to consumers through the way theproduct is developed produced sold serviced andadvertised” if we do what we say we will do – more oftenthan not – we will beneﬁt from this through being moretrustedit is all in the consumer’s mindbrand equity sits in the mind of the consumer consisting ofthose associations attitudes and behaviors linking to thebrand and we want the consumer to know that our promiseis what we say it is not for that consumer to disbelieve whatwe say when the consumer is confronted with our brand wewant a positive response to the message conveyed by thebrand and for that consumer to trust our promisethe evolution of trust in this context not only increases theattention given to our brand claim but also offers a degree ofprotection to our brand that a less trusted brand would notreceive as the authors here point out trusted brands aremore likely to be given a second chance by the consumerfollowing a failure or bad publicity for example it isinteresting to note the continuing brand strength of nescafe´despite a longterm campaign by various pressure groupsagainst the company the brand promise consistently highquality instant coffee protects against the accusations ofunfair trade and third world exploitationa less

individual ownership business structure is useful in preventing further negative spillover effect throughout the franchised chain when the brand crisis occurs at a single franchise location the

of  ingredient buyers from a multinational ingredient manufacturer aiming to initiate ingredient cobranding agreements in the energy component industry the results of the structural equation model
