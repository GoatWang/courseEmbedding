refer you to our latest k and other sec filings our comments today may also include nongaap financial measures additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release which is on our websitewith that i hand the call over to simon ayatsimon ayatthank you simon ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call second quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was  this represents an increase of  sequentially and  when compared to the same quarter last year during the current quarter we recorded  of charges this primarily relates to cameron merger and integration charges as well as a financing agreement we entered into with our primary customer in venezuelawe received an interest bearing promissory note in exchange of  million of receivables the accounting rules required us to record this note as its estimated fair value on the date of the exchange which resulted in a chargeour second quarter revenue of  billion increased  sequentially largely driven by the production group as a result of strong pressure pumping activity in north america landpretax operating margin only increased  basis points to  highlights by product group were as follows second quarter reservoir characterization revenue of  billion increased  sequentially primarily due to higher international activities across its product lines beyond the seasonal rebounds in russia and caspian and the north sea regionmargins of  were essentially flat drilling group revenue of  billion increased  sequentially while margin increased  basis points to  these increases were driven by strong directional drilling activity in us land combined with the seasonal increases internationallyproduction group revenue of  billion increased  sequentially while margin expanded by  basis points to  these results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity and the pricing recovery in north america landthe cameron group revenue of  billion increased  sequentially this increase was largely driven by higher sales in surface systems across all areas and increased valve and measurement activity in north americamargins increased  basis points to  as onesubsea margins exceeded  for the fourth straight quarter as a result of strong project execution the booktobill ratio for our longcycle businesses increased to  in the first quarter this marks the first time these businesses have been above  since the fourth quarter of the booktobill ratio for our longcycle businesses decreased to  in the q now turning to schlumberger as a whole the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was  in the second quarter compared to  in the previous quarter this increase was primarily driven by the increased earnings in north americathe etr will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between north america and the rest of the world we expect the etr will increase next quarter as north america continues to represent an increasing proportion of our earningsin the second quarter we generated  million of cash flow from operations working capital consumes approximately  million of cash during the quarter partially reflecting the growth in activity in addition to increased investments in preparation for the growthworking capital also reflected the payment of  million in severance during the quarter we remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow target for the year during  driven by a very strong performance in the second half of the yearour net debt increased  billion during the quarter to  billion we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of  billion during the quarter we spend  million to repurchase  million shares at an average price of we started off the second quarter with a higher rate of shared repurchases but reduces considerably as we progress on the edc discussions which will be  cash transactions paul will comment further on the edc transactionother significant liquidity events during the quarter included  million on capex and the investments of approximately  million in spm projects during the quarter we also made  million of dividend paymentsfull year  capex excluding spm and multiclient investments is still expected to be approximately  billionand now i will turn the conference call over to patrickpatrick schornthank you simon looking at activity geographically we had a very strong quarter in north america with revenue growing  sequentially driven by increased activity from the unconventional basis in us lands rapid deployment of our ideal hydraulic fracturing capacity and continued growth in our drilling related product lines all contributed to a  sequential revenue growth in us landshydraulic fracturing revenue increased by  sequentially significantly outperforming the  increase in the land rig count we remain sold out for several of our key directional technologies as our customers continue to move towards more complex well profiles with longer lateralsdespite the significant costs associated with reactivating equipment and infrastructure as well as adding people all of our us product lines were profitable in the second quarter this was driven by increases in products and service pricing improved operational efficiency proactive supply chain management and the growing impact of our vertical integration investments around sand production and distributioncameron also contributes to our strong financial performance with higher product sales in wells and measurements and increased activity for our service systems product line while we saw sequential revenue reductions from the us gulf of mexico and seasonally in western canadalooking forward we expect us land activity to remain strong throughout the second half of the year with our frac calendar already fully booked well into q and the high demand of our drilling services expected to continue we are also on track to complete the onestim joint venture during the second half of the year which will provide us with additional hydraulic horse power capacity as well as a full suite of multi stage completion technologyinternationally revenue increased  sequentially driven by growth in all geographical areas in most geo markets growth went well beyond the seasonal recovery from the winter slowdowneurope’s cis and africa revenue increased  sequentially driven by strong growth in the russia and cis region where we saw the start of the summer drilling campaigns in sakhalin together with continued strong activity in western siberianorth sea activity was strong in both the uk and norway as rig count increased and summer exploration work began while the rig count stabilized in sub sahara and africa as activity started to recover on land and with early signs of customers preparing to resume activity on key offshore projectsrevenue in latin american increased  sequentially driven by solid activity and sales in mexico and increased exploration and development work in columbia argentina revenue was also higher on increased unconventional land development while activity in brazil and venezuela remained weakecuador revenue was also somewhat lower sequentially however with the cooperation of petroamazonas shushufindi production has now turned around and started to recover towards the end of the quarterin the middle east and asia revenue increased  sequentially as activity in egypt iraq and the uae remained solid we also saw seasonal rebounce in activity in china driven by higher sales of completion products and services as well as our spm gas project in the indiscernible fields while drilling activity and product sales also grew in vietnam and thailandnext i would like to provide an update on our spm business and the rational behind their ongoing investment program today most of the work we undertake for our customers continues to be contracted as individual products and services and we do not see this changing in the foreseeable future however building on our broad technology offering and deep domain expertise we have overtime also established significant project management and integration capabilities which we offer to our customers through more collaborative and commercially aligned business modelsthe spm business model represents the ultimate alignment with our customers as we take on full field management of their assets risking the value of our product and services and sometimes cash and where we get paid a share of the value we generate from incremental productionour first spm project started in  after which we have gradually expanded this business to each day we manage  projects in  countries in  our spm business generated  billion in revenue and has over the period from  to  delivered return on capital employed which is around  basis points higher than the rest of our businessthe spm business therefore represents the highest multiple we can get on our technical capabilities and in addition these long term projects have provided a welcome full cycle baseline of activity revenue and returnsover the past three years we have seen a surge in spm opportunities from both existing and new customers which we have decided to proactively pursue this is by no means a desire to change the face of our company which will continue to be focused on market leadership in each individual product line but instead spm can create a baseline of activity to support our presence in the different geographieswe remain confident that despite our drive to expand our spm business which has a different contract structure compared to our traditional business we are not significantly changing the risk profile of the company that is because the biggest risk we continue to face as an oil field products and services company remains the cyclical nature of our industrythe spm business although different in nature and contractual structure will in fact help dampen the impact of these cycles provided the projects we invest in at the necessary full cycle robustness which of course remains a key selection criterion in all our evaluationsthrough our ongoing investment program we expect to double spm revenue over the next two years and overtime make spm equivalent in size to one of our existing four groupsin terms of financials we have made a total capital investment of  billion in spm projects since  which represents less than  of our cash flow from operations over the same periodour spm investments are currently being amortized at an annual rate of approximately  million and the amortization schedules are periodically reviewed and adjusted to match project life and economics the current investment in spm projects on our balance sheet is  billionin the last  months we have announced future multiyear investment plans of  million with ypf in argentina and  million with first ep and nnpc in nigeria in addition we have started off smaller projects with sm energy in the powder river basin in the us and with indiscernible in western canadagoing forward we will through a newly established venture funds look to access an increasing amount of external funding for our spm business through the refinancing of existing projects where today we carry  of the project funding and by inviting financial investors to take a share in our upcoming projectsso in summary our spm investment program is focused on establishing a full cycle activity revenue and financial base line in many of the countries we operate in as well as on continuously providing accretive returns when compared to our base businessi will now turn the call back over to paalpaal kibsgaardthank you patrick so next let’s turn to the oil market where a sustained growth and demand continues to provide a much needed foundation for the outlook leaving little reason for concern over this part of the oil market equationthe supply side however is far more complex with market nervousness and investors speculation generally overshadowing facts and physical fundamentals leading to unpredictable movement in oil prices inspite of a third year of global under investmentthe status of the global oil supply is best described by splitting the production base into three main block first russia and the opec gulf countries second us lands and third the rest of the worldthe opec gulf countries and russia which combine make or close to  of global oil production remain fully committed to sound and consistent stewardship of their resource base this is reflected in a steady increase in oil selectivity over the past three years as the world’s best well at economics easily absorbed the significant drop in oil pricesthese countries are also actively supporting the rebalancing of the global oil market by taking a procative role in moderating the current production levels the other two blocks of supply are currently pursuing diametrically post directions to both investments and resource management driven by the respective stakeholdersthe production level from the us land ep companies which currently represent around  of global oil supply is largely driven by the us equity investors who are encouraging enabling and rewarding short term production growth inspite of marginal project economicsthe fast barrels from us land are facilitated by a factory approach to both drilling and production and supported by a rapidly scalable supplier industry with a low barrier to entry in this market the pursuit of equity appreciation outweighs the lack of free cash flow net income and return on capital employed for both ep companies and the service industryand although the fast barrels from us land have already cooled the oil price sentiments as well as the evaluation of the equity investments themselves this has yet to limit the investment appetite for additional production growththe last book of producers making up the rest of the world today represents over  of global oil production and covers a broad and diverse group of iocs nocs and independent operators in aggregate this group is for the third successive year highly focussed on meeting the cash return expectations of their shareholders whether these are equity investors or governancethe operators meet these requirements by striving to keep production flat by producing their existing outlets part of their normal and by limiting investments to what provides short term contributions to production at the expense of increasing deflection ratesthese producers have also benefited from a production tailwind of  barrels to  barrels per day in each of the past three years coming from new projects where the majority of the investments were made in previous yearsand with a low rate of new projects being sanctioned since  this tailwind will taper off in the coming years this harvesting approach is not uncommon for conventional oilfields that are in their last years of life prior to being shut in however this investment in stewardship model is sustainable for a vast resource space that is both expected and required to provide a substantial part of global oil production for decades to comeneedless to say the longer the current under investment carries on the more severe the cliff like decline trend will likely be when the producers run out of short term options to maintain production and given the size of the production base it would be difficult for the rest of the global producers to compensate for this pending supply challengeso how does this supply and demand situation translate into the current status of the oil market following the extension of the opec and nonopec production cuts agreed in late may the oil markets and also included we are expecting to see clear reductions in global inventory levels in the second quarter leading to a more positive sentiments in the oil marketinstead oil prices and market sentiments became unexpectedly more negative driven largely by fear of oversupply from the growing production from us land where investments and activity is booming this increasingly negative sentiment is reflected in the oil markets interpretation of the latest industry data points first the fact that oil to the inventories are coming down so much slower than expected is currently a major concern for the market although inventories are still coming down and the drills are expected to accelerate in the second half of this yearand second the fact that production from libya and nigeria has increased in recent months it is also a major concern for the market even though these countries were excluded from the production cuts because their production levels were low at the time of the agreementwhat we are currently witnessing is that the us equity investors and ep companies have spooked the oil market investors into believing that the fast barrels from us land will flood the markets and leave inventory levels elevated for the foreseeable futuretherefore their pursuit of short term equity returns from the us land ep stocks is actually preventing the recovery of the oil market and sending oil prices further down thereby eliminating any equity appreciation that the investments set out to create in the first placeso what does this mean for the outlook for oil prices and ep investments the latest developments in the oil markets has created more uncertainty around the shape and timing of the global industry recovery however the near to medium term market evolution will continue to be dictated by the following three factors first with the moderation and the investment appetite towards the fast but marginal barrels from us land leading to a stronger focus on ep financial returns and the need to operate within free cash flowsecond with the key opec and nonopec countries extends the production cuts beyond the current nine month agreement and third with the emerging trend of a gradual investment increase in the rest of the world accelerate develop mitigate or at least dampen the pending mediumterm supply challengesthese three factors are somewhat interdependent and forecasting the forward part from the current market situation is at present difficult given the unpredictable and at times irrational behavior of the broader oil marketstill it remains clear to us that the current underinvestment in the rest of the world with increasing certainty create a mounting supply challenge over the coming years which will require a significant increase and acceleration in global ep spendat present we are seeing the first small signs of increasing investments in the rest of the world however the further evolution of this emerging trend will still be governed by the actions of the opec gulf countries and russia on one side and the us equity investors and ep companies on the othernew fund moderation from the us producers combined with continued moderation from the opec gulf countries and russia should pave the way for a steady increase in oil pricesthis in turn will provide an investment platform that will allow all three supplier groups to increase ep spend to jointly help mitigate the pending supply issues on the other hand an absence of moderation from both sides could lead to further drop in oil prices which in turn would both accelerate and amplify the pending supply issuesin this market we continue to focus on serving our customers and driving on business forward by broadening our technology portfolio and increasing our addressable market by further streamlining our execution machine and by pursuing new and more collaborative ways of working with our customersand in doing so we are maintaining a balanced coverage of the global oil and gas industry allowing us to effectively address current and future customer activity this includes us land where we today are seeing strong growth in both activity and service pricingthe opec gulf countries and russia already continue to see strong activity and a broad uptake of our entire technology offering as well as the rest of the world which in spite of record low activity levels still represent over  of global oil production and we’ll at some stage need to return to considerably higher investment levels even to just uphold current productionas part of our global focus we yesterday announced our intention to acquire a majority stake in the eurasia drilling company in russia this extents the success for longterm relationship we have enjoyed with edc through this strategic alliance we sign in  which has enabled the deployment of a broad range of our drilling and well engineering services to our customers in russia landthe pending edc transaction together with our recent investment in a land rig manufacturing facility in kaliningrad will further broaden our present infrastructure and capabilities used to serve the conventional russian land drilling marketin western siberia the land drilling contractors continue to have the leading role in providing integrated drilling services through turnkey models and as the uptake of horizontal drilling continues to increase the deployment of integrated drilling systems through the edc platform including our rig of the future will allow us to bring new levels of drilling efficiency to our existing and new customers in this large marketso we are pleased to have reached this agreement with the edc shareholders and we are already well advanced in preparing the regulatory filings required to complete this transactionthat concludes our prepared remarks we will now open up for questionsclick here to read question and
