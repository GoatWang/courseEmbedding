holdings such as long and short positions in various equity fixed income currency commodities and futures markets primarily on the overall economic and political views of various countries or their macroeconomic principles for example if a manager believes the united states is headed into recession he might short sell stocks and futures contracts on major us indices or the us dollar or seeing big opportunity for growth in singapore might take long positions in singapores assets breaking down global macro strategy global macro funds build portfolios around predictions and projections of largescale events on the countrywide continental and global scale implementing opportunistic investment strategies to capitalize on macroeconomic and geopolitical trends global macro funds are

policies around the world and make highly leveraged currency trades using futures forwards options and spot transactions interest rate strategies usually invest in sovereign debt making directional bets as well as relative value trades regarding stock index strategies global macro funds make countryspecific directional bets on market indices using futures options and exchangetraded funds etfs
