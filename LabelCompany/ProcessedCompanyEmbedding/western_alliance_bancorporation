walk you through the slide deck that’s been posted on the website and then we’ll open the lines for your questions before we get started with the presentation i’d like to take the opportunity to welcome ken vecchione to western alliance ken rejoined the bank as our president many of you recall ken served as our chief operating officer and president from  to  and he continued to be a member of our board of directors we’re pleased to have his leadership in the organization ken’s vision helped us establish our national business lines as well as put together the architecture around our enhanced risk management within the company i spoke on the last call about needing to focus more of my attention on continuing to grow our earnings bringing in business and bringing ken to the team along with jim haught who joined us in april as chief operating officer will allow myself and dale spend more time identifying ways to continue to improve our financial performance as well as manage our risk portfolio this was our th consecutive quarter of record operating earnings as our strong balance sheet growth continue while we maintained our interest margin and asset quality held expenses flat and again grew our tangible book value net income for the second quarter was  million or  per share that’s up  from  of operating eps in the second quarter of last year which was before  in acquisition charges our strong core deposit growth reduced our loantodeposit ratio increased our cash position which resulted in a  basis point reduction in the net interest margin as a percentage last quarter we discussed that we made some investments in our infrastructure that ticked our expense run rate up and we expected expenses to be flat in the second quarter as they were our flat expenses coupled with  million increased in revenue brought our operating efficiency ratio to  improved from  on a linkedquarter basis and from  in the second quarter of last year balance sheet growth was solid again with  million in loan growth during the quarter and  billion from the prior year while we had  million in deposit growth which was entirely noninterest bearing accounts deposits are up  billion in the last  months asset quality was also strong with nonperforming assets following  from a year ago to just  of total assets and we flip back into a net loan recovery position with  million for the second quarter we’ve provided  million during the quarter into the reserve for continued loan growth with our return on tangible equity again in excess of our balance sheet growth our tangible common equity ratio rose to  at june th and our tangible book value per share rose at a  annualized rate during the quarter to  net interest income rose  million for the quarter to  million driven by  million in average loan growth in realizing the full effect of the fomc rate increase in march and is up  from a year ago higher deposit service charges were the primary driver of the  increase in operating noninterest income on a linked quarter basis to  million as i said operating expense was flat from the first quarter to  million operating leverage improved over the last year’s revenue rose  and expenses were up  resulting in an increase in preprovision net revenue of  the provision for loan losses was  million for the quarter and benefited from net recoveries and lower levels of nonperforming loans after modest losses incurred in disposing of  million in repossessed real estate pretax income was  million the tax rate rose to  as the cyclical excess tax benefit on sharebased payment awards that was recognized in the first quarter of this year does not repeat in the current quarter resulting in  million of net income which is up  from a year ago diluted share were stable from year end at a  million as per share earnings climb  to  i’ll now turn it over to dale for some further details on our performance and then i’ll talk a little bit about our outlook dale gibbons net interest drivers loan yields rose  basis points during the quarter it’s just over half of our portfolio’s variable rate and benefited from the increase in prime as the target fed funds rate was raised by the fomc the investment portfolio yield declined  during the quarter as the balance grew by  million the average yield on securities purchases during the quarter was  as the yield curve flattened reflecting the rising rate environment the cost of interestbearing deposits rose  basis points during the quarter although our total cost of liability funding increased by only one basis point  as it benefited from our strong noninterestbearing deposit growth given the strong deposit growth we held no fhlb or fed funds borrowed positions at quarter end the increase in average loans of  million and securities of  million during the quarter drove net interest income to a  million the average balance of noninterestbearing deposits rose over  billion during the quarter however  of this increase was held in cash yielding just over  adding this  million at a  spread reduced the margin otherwise by  basis points however this was largely offset by higher loan yields from the rate increases in march and june resulting in the actual margin only decreasing by  basis points from q purchase loan accounting accretion rose from  million in the first quarter to  million in the second quarter and had a  basis point effect in total on the margin the graph on the right shows that we expect currently stable accretion from purchase accounting marks in the next few quarters actual accretion however has been higher than what is shown here due to loan prepayment activity which accelerates discount recognition although unlike the increase we had in the second quarter it should be on a gradual downward trend strong revenue growth during the quarter coupled with flat expenses drove the efficiency ratio to a record low of  compared to  in the second quarter of ‘ as we stated on our last quarterly call seasonally the first quarter is the most challenging from an efficiency perspective we achieved this record efficiency while continuing to invest in the company’s people infrastructure and compliance to the risk management programs the compensation proportion of our expense rose from  to  during the past year a trend which we expect to continue as incentive cost closely track balanced sheet growth and financial performance our preprovision net revenue of  and  return on assets also mark new highs for the company and its consistently been in the top docile compared to peers as deposit growth again exceeded loan growth during the quarter our securities and cash position climbed  million during the period total assets rose to  billion and shareholders equity to over  billion the loantodeposit ratio was  compared to  one year ago loan growth of  million during the quarter was led by a  million in mortgage warehouse as growth rebounded from a decline in the first quarter regionally loans grew  million in arizona  million in northern california  million in southern cal while declining  million in nevada during the quarter we continued our program with resi loan purchases as an alternative to larger growth in mortgagebacked securities resulting in a increase of  million in residential and consumer loans as short rates rose but the yield curve flatten during the quarter the weighted loan origination rate was the same as that paid down on loans during the period growth in noninterest bearing deposits comprised more than  of the  million total deposit increase we had during the quarter as money market balances decline the continued success in deposit gathering for noninterest bearing ddas has increased the proportion of the portfolio to over  compared to  a year ago and was the major factor as to why our total liability funding costs rose only  basis point from q among the business segments arizona led deposit growth of  million followed by  million in technology and innovation  million in northern california and  million in our homeowners association services total adversely graded assets declined  million to  million as npas fell  to  million or  of total assets these figures are net of  million of purchase accounting discounts to unpaid principal balance on the purchased credit impaired notes on a ratio basis adversely graded assets and npas have improved from  to  on assets over the past year gross credit losses of  million during the quarter were more than offset by  million of recoveries of prior chargeoffs primarily in nevada resulting in net recoveries of  million or  basis points of total loans yeartodate net loan losses are only a  provision expense of  million declined during the quarter  declined from the first quarter in part due to net recovery performance the allowance for loan and lease losses rose to a  million up  million from a year ago this reserve is  of nonacquired loans as acquired loans are booked at a discount to the unpaid principal balance and hence have no reserve but acquisition the allowance for loan losses is enough to cover over  years of gross loan losses at our current run rate which is well above the fouryear duration of the portfolio for acquired loans on a lower graph credit discounts totaled  million at june  which was  of the  billion purchased loan portfolio capital growth again exceeded balance sheet expansion resulting in our ratios continuing to climb over the past year the decrease in the leverage ratio during the quarter results from it being the only ratio that is computed using average instead of ending assets average assets rose  billion over the first quarter as noninterest bearing deposits grew by comparison ending assets were up  million for the period we expect the leverage ratio to increase this quarter as average total asset growth was likely to be significantly lower tangible book value per the share rose  in the quarter it is  and it was  in the past two year while return on tangible common equity rose to over  robert sarver thanks dale in terms of looking at our outlook for the rest of the year for the most part its kind of samosamo in terms of our financial position our second quarter performance reconfirmed our outlook for low doubledigit organic balance sheet growth for the rest of the year loan pipelines remained strong geographic divisions are healthy and growing as well as our national business lines we expect to see growth in all categories of our loan and deposit book for the remainder of the year given our projected loan deposit growth and assetsensitive balance sheet we’re well positioned for continued revenue increases we expect yields on our loan portfolio to climb in the third quarter as the prime rate increase in midjune is yet to be fully reflected in revenues however this improvement will be partially offset since acquired loan accretion is likely to fall from elevated level in the second quarter as the acquired portfolio continues to pay down our cost of interest bearing deposits rose  basis points during the quarter which should represent a deposit betas of  relative to the  basis point increase in the target fed funds rate if rate increases continue we expect deposit beta to eventually time towards our  target from the second quarter we expect our expense growth rate to average approximately twothirds of the revenue growth rate which should lead to further improvement in our efficiency ratio over time as you know we have a disciplined credit culture our asset quality metrics remained very strong we don’t currently except any significant credit events that would change our stable performance in this area however the regulatory agencies have combined to recently provide new guidance on the rating of preprofit technology companies this change will not affect the accrual status or inherent risk of our tech lending portfolio from what it is today but it will result in some higher levels of reported special mention credits bridge bank’s technology loans have had an average loss rate of  basis points for the last five years i’ve personally had a chance to see this portfolio up close over the last  months as we’ve gone through a little bit of a cycle in the valuations of technology companies in summary the new regulatory guidelines are as follows if the credit – if a preprofit credit has less than a sixmonth rml remaining months liquidity that loan must be graded special mentioned or worse unless it has a signed firm term sheet a lot of the credits in this space go below six months companies are in the process of underwriting new investments into the company and these companies are pretty successful listed ones in our portfolio have been very successful raising additional capital and continuing to fund company but at a six month level they need to go into special mention and so i think over the next six months you’ll see that number jump a little bit i don’t think it’ll be too significant but it could be somewhere in maybe  million range our level of special mention credits in general compared to peers is very low so i expect to see some of those credits move into that and then also move out very quickly but that is the change coming consistent with our historical metrics over the past several years we expect our levels of nonperforming assets and net chargeoff ratio to remain very low for the rest of the year so with that i would be happy to answer any questions overall as you can see just another solid quarter for a solid bank thanks questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from brad milsaps of sandler oneill peter ruiz hey guys this is actually peter ruiz on for brad today just wanted to first touch on maybe looking at  loan growth obviously has been nice and deposit growth has been even better and i appreciate your updated guidance on continuing to see low doubledigit asset growth but is it safe to assume that maybe deposit growth continues to outpace loan growth here in the near term are there any special things going on there that youre seeing in terms of loan growth obviously there is nothing wrong with a low double digit pace there just wondering if there are any sort of special situations robert sarver no i think the deposit growth probably will outpace the loan growth and  what you see with us is were a little more aggressive in terms of organic growth and a economy that’s maybe not quite as profit and a little more conservative maybe as the economy gets a little more profit in some days we do business with so we’re just first and foremost we’re concerned with asset quality improved lending and that means we grow a little bit less than we did for the first five years coming out of the recovery that’s probably a smart thing peter ruiz and maybe just could you maybe  looking at your credit obviously had the drop there in special mentions but classified kind of ticked up can you talk about maybe any changes or any progress related to those construction projects you mentioned last quarter and sort of any moments in those buckets robert sarver yes i’ve talked about a couple of those last quarter so one of them was a special mention credit that had some cost overranch but mainly some long delays in development it was in los angeles residential and that all kind of got solved and money got put in and lots of finished and all that so that came off the list we do have a hotel under construction that suffered some rain delays and pretty significant cost overranch which our borrower fund which is good and that hotel is substandard it is supposed to open in the next three to four weeks fortunately our loantovalue ratio is going to be under  in the hotels in a fantastic market so once it opens it gets a little history under its bell and will be upgraded so i think that will probably come off the list either in the third or fourth quarter that’s our second largest sub and then our largest sub which we talked about is a company that was sold to one of the larger market cap companies in the country and that loans comes due in the fourth quarter and it will – we feel pretty confident it’ll just be paid off when it comes due so between those two that represents a little over  million on the substandard level and i think those will be up both be up by year end and that’ll pop that number back down unless something new comes up we don’t see right now but good operator the next question will come from timur braziler of wells fargo timur your line is open are you muted by chance timur braziler good morning sorry about that first question is regarding some of the commentary towards the end of the call on the bridge loans and the new regulatory guidance there i guess what’s the balance of the loans that are currently below  months are remaining liquidity and if they do move to substandard is that going to potentially drive any kind of reserve impact and elevated provisioning or is that not the case robert sarver no i don’t think that’s the case in terms of our portfolio of bridge the niche bridge is in companies that have a product they are selling a product and about twothirds of our business is secured with receivables and cash some with formal receivable lines some with informal receivable lines what we see is going to happen is we’ll have more credits moving in and out of special mention i don’t think it will effect i don’t see it affecting the substandard category is a nonaccrual category i think its really just going to be more of a special mention credit category because bridge has been – and our customers have been pretty accurate and pretty effective at these new rounds and obviously that’s why the portfolio over the last  years have performed so well so i don’t think it’s going to affect the eventual substandard bucket or nonaccrual bucket or loss bucket but you’re going to see more movement in the special mention bucket and in terms of the portfolio the bridge portfolio in total on the tax side it’s about  million and of that the companies that are in a preprofit stage of that  million is probably somewhere around the  million to  million and today the number of those credits that are under a sixmonth rml would be – i am going to say maybe somewhere around a  million bucks but some of those do have signed term sheets so its not an all black and white i think that number of maybe up to  million in terms of potential increase since special mention is probably a reasonable estimate at this point but it doesn’t mean that those credits are going to continue to flow down the line in the substandard or the nonaccrual and therefore affecting the level of reserve so i don’t really see it affecting our loan loss reserve levels at all timur braziler okay great that’s very appreciated thank you next maybe on the margin there was a cash position at the end of the quarter and with the expectation for deposit growth to remain as strong as it has been outpacing loan growth is it june hike going to be enough to maybe see some margin expansion in the coming quarter or is that cash position going to continue to be headwind dale gibbons no that cash position has been run down now to kind of it’s prelevel  million we expect the margin to rise this quarter timur braziler okay great and then one last one from me on expenses has the regulatory conversation kind of come to ahead and the regulators have signed off on what was necessary to be done in the first quarter or is this something that you guys have put in the work but are still waiting kind of regulatory signoff or the regulatory green light on anything coming down the pike in the remainder of the year robert sarver yeah i mean the regulators don’t dictate who we hire and what our overhead levels are i mean they are really a function of the bank and the growth of bank and plus how we manage our risk profile so they have no signup on anything as it relates to our overheads so im not quite sure were going with that but as it relates to some of the infrastructure we expanded we’ve pretty much done that what weve added coming on obviously is ken couple other key positions but i don’t – at the end of the day i really don’t see us operating materially different than we have for the last eight years and we just grow our revenue faster than our expense and somehow we seem to manage to do that every quarter so i don’t see that changing operator and next we have a question from brett rabatin of piper jaffray brett rabatin just a clarification on the margin and the excess liquidity so it sounds like the cap position has drawn down and so the margin what would be  or  basis points higher absent in q you got the june rate high does the cash position go down due to investment in securities loan growth can you give us any more help on just how you’re managing the balance sheet after an early strong deposit growth quarter robert sarver you saw we had a very large increase in average dda that was more than the quarterly increase in dda so we have uploaded balance for part of the quarter and that was invested were held at the federal reserve account yield just over  that has gone away and as a result just taking that away will blew some margin by itself and then in addition to that you have the points you brought up brett in term of we’ve got a fivesixth of the increase from fomc in june is still in front of us in q brett rabatin okay and then just a clarification on you talked about expenses somewhat in the twothirds you used to always talk about  revenue or  revenue for every dollar of expense and now it sounds like that a little bit different is that due to anything in particular and can you talk maybe more about some mediumterm expense growth outlook as you think about things were investing on robert sarver i think its mainly due to the fact that our risk appetite on the credit side our loan book is not going to be going at  originally we don’t think it’s a right time in the market to do that and we don’t see the right riskadjust returns to do that brett rabatin and then if i can sneak in one last one on cre are you guys a little more cautious on cre just thinking about the growth you had in the quarter or you not seeing as good opportunities whats the thought on cres from here robert sarver no i think on the cre side we’re always trying to be proactive not reactive and a big part of our book is on the residential side refinanced lots and production housing to some of the top builders with onbalance sheet projects and that market looks pretty good i mean it’s a steady increase the levels of homebuilding is still well below historical levels it’s not even close to where it was before the last recession and we think that’s a really good space to play it in terms of the commercial side of things where we have not been a big retail lender ive never really been a big fan of taking longterm retail credit risk we play mainly in office medical and commercial office space and industrial on the apartment side we really have reframed from doing much apartment lending over the last five years we’re just getting into it a little bit as the market has kind of shut that space down we’re finding some select opportunities in some of the markets that haven’t been overbuilt and we’re in a position now to get  to  cash equity in projects and good pricing so we try to manage our real estate book in a very savvy manner and i think it had about a  year history of doing that brett rabatin okay great i appreciate all the color operator the next question comes from chris mcgrathy of kbw chris mcgrathy hey good afternoon thanks for taking the question i’m wondering if you could speak to credit spreads in the ci portfolio obviously the growth in your ci books has been very strong yeartodate and i think the deposit growth is pretty correlated wondering if you’re seeing more you’re willing to compete more aggressively on price to get the deposit in the door seemingly that factor that most banks would like to have the deposit growth thanks robert sarver are you talking about to compete more in price on the loan side or deposit side i didn’t quite get you chris mcgrathy no i’m sorry the loan side robert sarver no we’re are pretty disciplined on the pricing and we’re focused on relationships we can really add value that’s one of the reasons you’ve seen more growth in some of our national business lines because there’s less competition less banks that have the people the sophistication and expertise in those specific areas so we want customers here because number one we think we can add value to the relationship and they’re willing to pay for that value chris mcgrathy that’s great dale if i could on the margin i think in the prior comments you’ve mentioned each quarter hike is about  basis points to the margin is the margin and are your loan yields responding now that we’re a few hikes in are they responding the way that you thought they were is that kind of still a fair guideline going forward dale gibbons yeah it is a fair guideline there has been one development though has taken away a little bit from what otherwise would have been a stronger increase and one that has been at the opposite so our deposit beta has been well below  which means that we should be even above the  basis points for  because we’re not going to raise our cost as much however at the same time what is we’ve seen the yield curve has come back down in the commercial and real estate market really prices off of the  to  year yield curve which has dropped significantly from at the end of last year and particularly the first quarter so that has taken away a little bit of what would have been even a stronger performance but that has basically been offset by the slower deposit betas chris mcgrathy great and if i could sneak one in on ma obviously you are accumulating capital really nice way i’m wondering if there is any change in what you’re seeing or maybe any closer to finding an acquisition thanks robert sarver no not really i’d say about the same as last quarter i mean we’re in the market looking at a number of opportunities but nothing in the eminent future one of the challenges people always say “well you traded a high multiple book and it’s in that” well we also grow our earnings assets in about every bank in the country and so we just got to be cautious on how we give those shares out that adds a little bit of a challenge chris mcgrathy thank you very much operator the next question will come from jon arfstrom with rbc capital jon arfstrom good morning question on deposit growth you have another good quarter but arizona was particularly strong is there anything notable there driving that growth robert sarver no i mean we continue to execute in terms of bringing in relationships in the commercial side that we take their operating accounts as well and were having i’d say increased success in that category i wouldn’t get too hung up on the arizona piece i think were kind to seeing that everywhere i do realize that’s where we posted some of those items but… dale gibbons i think if you look at more spanks a lot of growth tends to come from headquarters so we have lot of senior executives here and just naturally a lot of the larger relationships are coming from this area jon arfstrom just a few good quarters in a row and i just it was a sizeable increase on the loan growth you called out the warehouse coming back a bit anything else to call out on the loan growth that was unusual or would you view this is a pretty typical quarter robert sarver pretty difficult nothing unusual jon arfstrom and dale do you thing the warehouse size can hang around at this level for the next quarter or so dale gibbons yes i think you can i mean the reason why warehouse came down in q and it wasn’t just us it was even more pronouns at some other institutions is because the rates rose until the refi business really contracted with rates coming back down youre seeing refi activity pick up again so unless we see a significant rate rise on the term structure i think youre likely to see warehouse perform  continue to perform well jon arfstrom okay good robert just one for you you mentioned this earlier but with jim and ken in place are you already changing your daytoday activities and if so whats different robert sarver yes i’m – well i would say this with jim in place jims taking a fair amount of the load off of with me and dale on some of the administrative sides in terms of operation technology ken is in the process of kind of going on the road and visiting all our offices and all our people and over the next  days or so he will be taking some of my direct reports i got like  right now i want to take that down about  or  and really free up more times of my desk that to get out and try to generate revenue which is probably what i’m better at anyway operator the next question comes from casey haire of jefferies casey haire i wanted a follow up on the efficiency obviously very good improvement this quarter with the liquidity drag just what in sort of  and it sounds like there is more on the comp what is sort of the optimal efficiency ratio for what’s a pretty diversified business how low can we go from here robert sarver i don’t know i mean to be honest i don’t really pay much attention to it as a percentage i mean it stands out being pretty low because you compare to peers but our business model is totally different than peers so to me its about operating leverage and growing earnings per share and i wont really target a number or range casey haire okay great and on the deal front we’ve seen some activity this week some commercial finance companies selling without the  rather deposit funding and strong growth they are partnering up with banks im just curious are you seeing those opportunities and if so why  whats… robert sarver yes we are and i think those are good opportunities in general those are good opportunities and we are and we look at all of them but maybe underwrite them different than other people or what have you and some are more appealing than others but i do think that that is an area that intrigues us and consider nicely if it’s the right situation casey haire okay great and just last one from me on the noninterest bearing deposit growth apologies if i missed this but in terms of characterizing it is it mostly – is it broad across the footprint or is it mostly coming from bridge just some color on where these noninterest bearing deposit flows are coming from robert sarver i mean bridge has had a lot of success here but i wouldn’t certainly not  most of the growth is not from them i’d say it’s fairly broad in terms of kind of where we’re seeing improvement casey haire okay great thank you operator the next question is from gary tenner of da davidson gary tenner thanks good morning i had a question about the national business lines your quartertoquarter yearoveryear they’ve been called  to  of your loan growth and are now  or so total loans can you talk about kind of the comfort level in terms of how large that gets relative to the core commercial bank robert sarver to me it is our core commercial bank i mean we’re not just the arizona california nevada regional bank i mean we are a national bank and these national business lines we have to meet are core to our business and we’re going to continue to expand them as we can do it in a prudent manner with good riskadjusted returns so i know sometimes you guys like to separate all that out but i don’t  for me it’s not really much of a difference i mean if i get a operating company that have in boston in boston or operating company backed in phoenix it doesn’t really make a difference to me gary tenner so there is no reason to think that over time the existing products or if you add some other line there that wouldn’t become bigger than regional banks robert sarver it may or may not i don’t know it will depend where we see those opportunities to be gary tenner okay and within that just on the hotel finance the hotel franchise finance those balances were down about  so far this year when you bought the portfolio last year you talked about it being an ongoing business are you  is there something you’re saying in that segment that is having you pull back on new business or is it robert sarver yeah we said when we bought it we keep the portfolio pretty stable on a macro level i think in terms of commercial real estate that’s one of the product types that you’ve seen significant appreciation in over the last six or seven years and so our level of underwriting today is commensurate with where we see that risk and i see that portfolio somewhere between  to  of our outstanding loan book but its not a book that we’re looking to push aggressively under some of the credit terms that maybe some of the others players are willing to expect gary tenner okay thanks for the color operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to robert sarver for any closing remarks robert sarver yeah no thanks for joining us and just another good quarter i think as we continue to be consistent in how we approach our business and operated high level so we look forward to talking
