stars based on  reviews leave us a review brian hooked my coffee up lort donuts on point also will definitely have to come back love this place i stop by every thursday for an iced coffee love all the flavors they have and the donuts are nice and moist i will continue to return great customer service as well this place is awesome lots of really good donuts to select from and the owner is very friendly the good and the bad thing about this place is that we leave real close  i would have to workout everyday great variety still available at am on a weekday and reasonably priced monkey scored crullers last two crisp outside soft inside inverted cinnamon roll wchocolate yum cream puffs perfect bites covered in powdered sugar to fingerprint your car with evidence mini cakes eye catching colors are iced thick overpowering the cake apple fritter perfect little apple  for  mini cakes  for half dozen donuts  for  cream puffs friendly smiley helpful service s music coffees  espresso available monkey shall return best doughnuts spot hands down  i love this mom and pop place  the girls are super sweet the doughnuts are always fresh  definitely the place to pick up and go specially while marketing  the iced coffee is delicious also  crowd pleaser and definitely a place to try if your in the mood for a good doughnut fantastic donuts this is the only donut spot that i consistently return to the cake donuts are great the glazed donuts are great the cinnamon rolls are great everything is delicious the donuts here are the perfect balance of not being too sugary service is always friendly quick and efficient it can be quite busy in the mornings so its best to come early so you can have a great selection to choose from the prices are also very fair as well i like to try different donut shops around town to bring donuts for the crew i work with on sundays this place was closed to work and home right off of charleston across from umc what i loved most about them was the selection of different kinds of oldfashioned doughnuts they had chocolatecovered maple covered and regular glazed oldfashioned plus a variety of other ones the donuts were fluffy and delicious my whole crew love them i will definitely be back no frills small business great donuts the have a wonderful variety always down for the free donut with check in amazing doughnuts so delicious thank you fox  news las vegas for sharing real doughnuts story on facebook yesterday i visited realdonust because they just offered kind of discount for a check in to behonest and to admit  i was in temptation to grab that offer but after the first jussy bite i started questioning myself why they need that when they are making such tasty and fresh donuts they just outstand a guy from the staff explained to me they are using mainly organic ingredients and ingredients from verified farms well that explained that unforgettable taste the service is on average level  not too fast or too clumsy the employees are busy but they can always answer your questions if any because a mouth full of tasty donuts will not allow you to speak so much but to eat in silence and in pleasure my favorite dounuts in vegas hands down ive tried all the others and chains but they blow them away never had a bad dounut here they were jus in the weekly as a good cheap eats but they said the service was spotty i always go at am when i get off work you can smell delcious goodness blocks away defintly a nice treat if a doughnuts tastiness is directly proportional to its size which i think there is a solid argument that it is then these are frickin scrumptious times  the glazed doughnut here is easily three times the size of your krispy kreme variety but they also carry a heftier price tag i only sampled the glazed but every one of the little darlings in the case looked top notch i was tempted by the pink frosting with sprinkles or the little buttermilk buns there was also a ginormous doughnut the size of an old  record the establishment is small and in addition to doughnuts carries thrifty ice cream coffee iced coffee and smoothies the girl working there was blasting the cure and if she were the doughnut maker real donuts would earn an extra star for being indie rock however she said she did not make the doughnuts they are made fresh there but not by her still i like the soundtrack on sundays you can get a dozen for  and during the weekdays if you buy  dozen you get  dozen free i have no idea what you are going to do with  dozen doughnuts maybe you can freeze them or host one heck of an office party real donuts they should have called it real awesome donuts i stopped in to try the  sized donut mentioned in the previous review how disappointing to find that they dont manufacture these donuts until  am guess i was a few hours too early so instead i opted for the whopping box of day old donuts for  i wouldnt normally buy a day old donut let alone six pounds no joke this box weighed at least  lbs of donuts but my cheap bastardness got the best of me i proceeded back to the office where i cut several of them in half and enjoyed at least  variates at this point in my life i would almost consider myself to be a connoisseur of the apple fritter although this was not the best fritter ive ever had i would say that it ranks in my top  it had many more apples than your standard fritter and that is a plus in my book the bear claws come in varying sizes which i liked however the filling was more of a spread than a pie fillingnot too impressed here thus the one star deduction the other donuts i ate were very good although it is rare that i come across a bad donut real donuts is open am  pm heck yes so get on in and get your donut on real donuts are the real deal one of the best in the valley the basic glaze donut is spectacular everything else i have tried has been quite good as well they have mastered the art of not having dry donuts in the desert with the apple fritters and the cake donuts the exterior has a nice light crunch with a slightly moist yet fluffy interior staff behind the counter is always cool too why settle for grocery store nuts of the dough when you can indulge in these tasty fried delights this place is near my school so its always a good option to swing in to get some breakfast i usually go for the stuffed one chocolate stuffed with bavarian cream yum after eating one of those i can die happy  on a side note they sell day old dozens for like  what a deal now this is a doughnut shop so many to choose from that i could have ordered  of them after a disappointing trip to dunkin donuts the other day got a box of mixed varieties jelly filled frosted with sprinkles orange glazed boston creme and more for  the person running the place was very friendly even though its in downtown id rather drive the  or so miles from centennial hills than the  minutes to dunkin donuts popped in since we were in the area and i was in the mood for a snacky snackby this time of the day they already sold out of all their cream filled goodies so i settled for a small apple fritter and a twist glazed donut both were pretty solid and tons better then your chain establishments most definitely be back if im in the areaaloha yelp  challenge a cops kryptonite the last stop on my vegas donut hunt very good donuts and wide selection at am when they open i tried the old fashioned buttermilk and chocolate raised and they were all great i didnt care too much for the chocolate glaze but the donut itself was good i can safely say out of all the places ive tried this is one of the best along with donut hut master donuts and friendly donut shop try either one of these places and youre guaranteed something good id recommend coming exactly when they open though if possible two words giant donut order one and you wont regret it thats all i have to say this place rocks great selection great prices and the employee was playing some good music too  perfect way to start a sunday best donuts in town  the solares family and crew are awesome worth standing in line for i love love  love donuts just call me homer cake donut with chocolate frosting is my favorite as i walked into the store there is the best smell ever that fresh baked donut smell the place was very clean and the donuts were displayed nice i had a chat with the guy behind the counter asking him questions for a catering company i do some work for he answered every question i had about his donuts then the moment of truth select a donut well of course i went for my favorite he bagged it and out to the car i went this donut was so fresh and soft the recipe for the cake portion was just the way i like it made with vanilla not lemon or spice vanilla just the way it was intended to be i am thinking this place gets my vote for the best donut in vegas if you in that area of town stop by my favorite donut shops in las vegas cant go wrong with real donuts they have the best ice cream best doughnut shop in town great customer service the maple doughnut is bomblicious this place is where real doughnuts are made this place is fantastic an amazing selection of donuts made fresh every morning by a family of great people tanya and brian are always helpful and smiling and in the back dad is pouring alot of love onto these beauties dont miss blueberry cake donut the chocolate butterfly and the delicious crumb donutsboth raised and cake why would anyone ever go to those faceless corporate spots when theyre blown away by this little oasis i should have wrote this review  years ago when i discovered it i love this place my hubby and i were looking for a place to stop on our way out of town and so glad we stumbled upon this place my favorite is the cinnamon crumb donutsyum the family that owns this is always so nice and helpful when we come in it is hands down the best donut place in las vegas and everyone i introduce this place to also falls in love great service great prices and the greatest donuts ever  i dont know how to judge donuts they were good didnt taste old there was a sweet old lady sitting there who hangs out there since everyday added to the cute character to the place very happy with my donuts one of my guilty pleasures in life has always been donuts i have been to many donut shops across the country if available i will always get a chocolate old fashioned then i might also get a cinnamon roll maple bar or something else that looks good i have tried many donut shops across las vegas in search of a really great donut the best i have found so far has been real donuts on charleston blvd the donuts always seem to be fairly fresh and the taste of the frostings are always good one thing they make that i really enjoy is their butterfly weather topped with regular icing or maple it is always good took nelson qs advice and got a apple fritter i was forced to get the full size because they were out of the half size om nom nom nice pieces of apple in the dough not too much glaze like other places making it the perfect amount of sweetness i also ordered a jelly filled pretty good as well the dough they use here is awesome because its the in between of the lightness of krispy kreme and the thick doughyness of standard donut shops this might be my new favorite spot for dontus too bad i live far but on the plus side i will start my intern at umc next month so they should be seeing me on a regular basis good for my taste buds but bad for my waist line ekks there are a number of donut shops to choose from in town but if you want one worth buying dont bother with any of the rest yes you heard medrive here from wherever in clark county you are i promise it will be worth it yes donuts are bad for you but if you are going to eat them why not eat the best the girl behind the counter was very friendly and happily explained prices and quality of the donuts we picked up some day olds which are a bargain at  dozen for  and brought them to work they were gone within  hours and no one ever suspected they were old my evaluation is based on the fresh donuts we tried it was incredibly early in the morning and i was pleased to see that they were open and ready for business i tried their large maple twist and had some of my girlfriends chocolate pecan roll and a bearclaw that we split i was blown away by the juiciness of each bite and the consistency of the dough thats not to mention the sheer novelty of their large specialty donuts the texas and the alaska youll never return to winchells dunkin or krispy kreme after youve become privy to this place i cant wait to return and try their monster donuts out sitting at my desk i overheard one coworker trying to convince another to eat some of the donuts knowing that customers vendors and coworkers drop off dozens of donuts from the huge chain manufactured donut companies often i was anxious for some sugar spiking in my blood walking to their desks i was shaken to my core which happened to be a ravenously angry and empty stomach  when he was merely offering up mini donuts from the vending machine this simply would not do do you hear me it would not do i explained my desire for fresh donuts not that packaged trash they asked if i wanted to make a donut run i said yes they started asking for me to go to one of the chain places i said nay if i was making a donut run i was getting real donuts of course they started naming off a different chain every time i would say no real donuts finally i had to explain that was the name of the place that was going to satisfy my sugar craving finding their location i walked in to a pretty busy donut shop good sign when it got to my turn the helpful girl behind the counter started grabbing everything i needed when i got to the ham  cheese croissant part of the order she gave me the option of hot or cold figure if were going to go for it go the whole  and went hot returning to work i handed out everybody their treat and sat down at my desk to dive into mine the raised cake donut was about x the thickness of one of those other places donuts i took a bite and my taste buds nearly fainted at the flavor it was an instant throw back to jr high and getting donuts after school at a local bakery only better i finished the donut and tackled the holes i picked up bite sized doses of glazed sugary goodness were devoured in mere seconds this is definitely a place i will be returning to as often as my pancreas can handle the love they put into their donuts shines through i have had the best apple fritter ever here they dont skimp on size or flavor the jelly donuts are oozing with jelly from the top of the donut we get them for our office biweekly making my tastebuds happy but killing my diet this is what donuts are meant to be keep up the great work i normally wouldnt waste my time reviewing a donut shop but real donut has the best donuts in vegas by a long long way well worth a drive across town the good folks in my department love their donuts it is by law that all employees at some point during their stay must bring in donuts and i guess it was my turn to bring in several boxes although i have yet to see that law in writing i havent been to real donuts before but the reviews on yelp and its short distance from my office were what brought me there at  am in the morning i ordered three dozen donuts for   for a dozen everyone in my department seemed to enjoy the donuts the boxes dont have a logo or any writing indicating where the donuts came from but a coworker was able to identify its origins coworker are these from real donuts me wtf look yes how did you know coworker educated guess real donuts are popular in these parts i know how they taste i stole one before the hoards came not sure what its called but it was sweet and a little crunchy though it was good it was too dense for my taste ill have to try the apple fritter next time or one of those donuts thats almost the same size as a toilet seat real donuts has proven to be a hit among my department and the upper management i live to see another work day i am not a donut person at all i can go months and years without having one or even desiring one perhaps after years of only being exposed to dunkin donut and krispy kreme many could understand why the only donut place i have ever liked before was voodoo donuts in my hometown of portland im not sure what made me stop into real donuts but i am glad i did nice chewy donuts with just the right amount of sweetness i would definitely stop in again clean and simple close to umc a friendly place to get good donuts other donut shops their donuts are super super sweet you get tired after two bites but this place  perfect love at first bite i only got half a dozen because i was afraid that my family wouldnt be able to finish them all i was surprised to come home to find them all gobbled up  to sum it up this will be the place for me to get fresh donuts delicious donuts for a reasonable price these are your standard cookie cutter donuts but cammann we all know theyre good bought a half dozen for  and a coffee the guy at the counter was super friendly and energeticgood energy for this type of shop for the last donut we were trying to decide between the blueberry cake or the cinnamon crunch i chose the cinnamon crunch and they guy threw in the blueberry cake donut for what i thought was free because he said we should try it because his friends like it i signed the receipt for  half dozen and coffee and when i checked my credit account online later saw that i was charged xx what the heck kind of trickery is this im going to let it slide this time because your donuts were bomb and you were nice best donuts ever delicious fresh good selection very friendly welcoming staff a dozen donuts and  milks was just  i will be back for sure i love going here on saturday morning great donuts and super friendly staff oh dear lord the maple bars a coworker used to bring a dozen assorted from real donuts to the office every thursday morning fresh soft delicious best maple bar to ever cross my lips though i have tried other flavors that were excellent too ive ventured over there later in the day and the donuts arent quite as magical but are still heaven in a box or bag this is a family owned  operated donut shopthe dad makes all of the donuts which are simply delish they have a great variety and have always been fresh on every visit brian the son works the counter and has a fun personality always clowning around you can really tell he loves his customers and just having fun cant go wrong here after reading the reviews on yelp i decided to try this little place out im new to lv and always looking for places to replace my home town loves i am  happy i chose this bakery it was clean the guy at the counter brian was super friendly and the prices were terrific it is a little out if my way from where i live and work but it is totally worth it i will be a customer for life  ps thank you for listening to my story about the bakersfield ca bakeries and for the super duper delicious blueberry donut you gave me donut  noun a small cake of sweetened dough often ringshaped or spherical with a jam or cream filling cooked in hot fat inverted cinnamon roll  noun a cinnamon roll with swirls of devils food cake found at real donuts on w charleston and shadow lane across the street from umc hospital one bite and youre in love  i stopped by this familyowned business and pat gallagher assisted me in picking out two dozen tasty delights for my office  two dozen mixed donuts came to   if available you can buy a box of dayold donuts for  each box contains  donuts  the drive to henderson was a little torturous with the smells emanating from the boxes in the back seat  you had me at the inverted cinnamon roll  ill definitely be back for more spheres and shapes cooked in hot fat fresh soft flavorful giant and deliciouswhat more could you want from doughnuts look no further if you work anywhere in the downtown area this is the doughnut shop for you this family owed little store tucked into a stripmall across from umc was probably the last place i expected to find my favorite doughnuts but ever since a coworker introduced me  years ago i have never wanted doughnuts from anywhere else even dare i say krispy kreme the variety is endless although i like the cake and regular glazed it doesnt actually have glaze just the doughnut with chocolate topping the plain glaze and the oldfashioned are also delicious the doughnuts are baked fresh every day and the staff at this family owed shop will remember you and become friends after just a few visits they also have milk to go with your doughnuts and coffee if you drink it a couple of small table allow the morning regulars to sit down and enjoy but they offer quick service for those of us running to work this may be a downtown secret but once youre in the know youll see from the friday morning crowd many others are too  ive been going to this place with my friends before school and we absolutely love it its a small family owned business thats a little far away from my school but the donuts are high quality and for good prices my friends always get the donut holes which are really cheap i also really like their giant donuts and their croissants items selected bavarian blueberry cake blueberry fritter sourcream buttermilk bar raised glazed reverse cinnamon roll chocolate cake crumb cake apple fritter having arranged various foodcrawls in the past it was with admitted enthusiasm that i entered real donuts to gather provisions for las vegas first known donut crawl and with several glistening varieties fresh from the fryer only two challenges arose the first limiting my order to a dozen and the second delivering the fried dough to the party without sneaking a bite a small clean shop with excellent service and a dozen donuts only  after tax and a tip it was up against three other doughnutteries that real would find itself matched and although the occasional contender from sunrise too master donuts or donut hut shined it was real donuts that proved most consistent across the board featuring crispy fritters rife with fruit and low in oil a textbook oldfashioned sourcream that literally melts on the tongue and both yeasted and cake options on par with the citys best it would truly be hard to name a bad one in the bunch  a task ill simply discard and suggest futile as i think back on the blueberry fritter a  cent daily special id suggest worthy of destination status we have been on a quest to find the best donut shop in town i believe that this one won in my book we got a half dozen donuts and they were all delicious with lots of flavor and didnt seem too sweet or heavy my favorite was one that looked like an old fashioned donut but had barvarian cream in the middle i cant remember what they called it but it was delicious and i cant wait to have another one everything we tried was really good the shop is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful in making selections working across the street from this jewel of a donut shop is a plus whenever i get the craving for a tasty chocolate cake donut i know real donuts will always deliver i have tried other donut shops including the more commercial shops but i find myself always comparing their donuts to the ones i get at this little shop no one beats them friendly staff great service and good prices once you try them once you will become a repeat customer guaranteed thank god this is close to my home they do have the best donuts in town the donuts were crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside what made this place great was the service extremely friendly overall an outstanding experience lets get the obvious out of the way  the donuts are incredible literally not a bad one on the menu from basic glazed to specialty ones like the fruit burritos  my god get a fruit burrito everything is delicious and the way you are treated when you are in there is how you would be treated if your family owned the business they are so kind and conversational theyre funny and helpful love the entire team they are also extremely accommodating i last minute put in an order for  donuts for my birthday party and they were able to get me pink donuts in a few hours love this place my go to place for donuts great donuts good selection dont forget to check in for a free donut mmmmdonuts this place is the best the cake donuts cant be beat and their mini donuts are perfect to take to an event ive gone in here around numerous holidays and they have festive options the staff is friendly and ive never waited more than a few minutes i also appreciate their early start in the mornings support this great bakery i have a pronouncement to make real donuts has the best buttermilk bar in las vegas when i was growing up nearby this place was a mediocre at best donut shop that also sold egg rolls im glad to see things have changed a lot since then value seekers they sell a big box of assorted day old donuts for just  best damn donuts in  las vegas period so delicious and fresh so many to choose from but my faves are the boston creme crunch to the edges yet soft and with lots of filling second favorite is their bear claws with the claw part tasting like a glazed donut and the center being pure yuminessyeah thats a word if you get there early mornings  is when i usually get there a mixed box of their day old donuts with about  of em is available for  excelled customer service and great prices they also have parking which is a plus highly recommended krispy kreams has some competition they bear claws are to die for very nice and patience customer service will recommend going for a great doughnuts great service these are probably the best donuts in town if you havent tried them you must they are so friendly and have such great food i have to try keep my self away from this place its addicting donuts and croissants are yummy you can really taste quality work put into these donuts im really happy stopped by to get some donuts this place is small but i promise you will be extraordinarily happy after you leave here  real donuts is what you get here they are not to sweet they are just right plus they keep milk on hand this shop is always clean the employees are always friendly i will return again  again because its so worth it have to step foot in here each time i have to make a trip into everything medical cant resist these donuts are unmatched  you gotta get the cream puffs before theyre gone best apple fritter ive ever had and the rest were pretty good not the most creative doughnuts in the world but very good excellent doughnuts i just left and sad i only purchased   blueberry fritter was amazing never had a doughnut like it must try only tip for the owner the shop smelled like cleaning chemicals love a clean shop but a little off putting when you walk into a bakery these donuts are so tasty its right across umc and they are definitely not overpriced this is the shop you want to go to if you just want some yummy donuts  not those over the top ones you see all over instagram simple tasty and affordable maybe ill give their classic coffee a try soon their donuts are so good i love it now that it is a christmas time they have cute items there they are very inexpensive and fresh one wordwow was looking for a donut shop

absolutely the best donuts in town i love donuts and coming from southern cali where the best donuts are made i consider myself a donut snob moist and delicious every single time you need to try it im upset i dont have a picture to show you but trust me these donuts are amazing when you walk up to the display case youre going to have a difficult time choosing which ones to take home they all look delightful and tempting honey buns glazed donuts cake donuts with and without icing bear claws and more i dont eat donuts often but when i do this is the place i go they live up to their name  real donuts they arent puffed up with air and they arent a mouth full of nothing they taste like the donuts i had when i was a little girl made with good ingredients baked to perfection and melt in my mouth dont forget to pick up some donut holes to munch on as you drive itll keep you satisfied until you can sit down and dig into the treasures you decided to buy perfect start to the morning the donuts were super fresh and delicious i chose  raised donuts with frosting and sprinkles how does one pass up sprinkles and a classic old fashioned all of them were awesome the woman running the shop was super friendly and greeted every person who walked in highly recommend great donuts its worth the jog from sls hotel i enjoyed every one of the donuts i got this morning half a dozen    my favorite is the cinnamon crumbs donut not too sweet and great taste of cinnamon in vegas on vacation last week being a donut lover i turned to yelp to find a place here yelpers came thru because this place has an amazing selection and my favorite is the blueberry fritter my husband and i liked them so much we stopped in again before heading home great coffe great donuts and great customer service i love this place i cant believe it took me this long to get around to writing this review when i was most active as their customers several years ago i used to work on commerce and charleston and i would need to be at my office by  am and made very frequent stops for an unhealthy breakfast at real donuts because it was on the way i was there all the time no regrets  i wish i could do that now you can tell they are a downtoearth small business which has gained their acclaim through word of mouth from making fantastic doughy goodness the ham and cheese croissants are everything i ever wanted in my life and look no further for a delicious maple bar i went again recently and its just as good as i remembered i need to eat more donuts so i have more excuses to stop by sweet real donuts had i purchased my donuts early morning they would have tasted fresher but i ended up buying a dozen stale donuts because i went there late in the afternoon overallthe cashier was very nice and approachable ill probably give them another try morning time of coursebefore writing them off permanently i wish them continued success in business i visit this donut spot atleast once a week they always have fresh donuts and often have  box specials im in love with the inverted chocolate cinnamon roll reminds me of when i was a job growing up in cali just a great fresh tasty donut without all the extra sometimes unnecessary bells and whistles get back to the basics the second best donuts ive ever had the first was in the early s in missoula montana at a store that had a donut machine where you could eat the hot greasy donuts as they rolled out this place is fantastic the blueberry cake donut was tender with a delicate crust on the outside just perfect my husbands blueberry fritter had that nice crunchiness on the outside and the inverted cinnamon roll with devils food cake was amazing ive had donuts from la to kuwait and these are exceptional the only thing i might change is they are heavily glazed and frosted not as bad as krispy kreme and i prefer mine lightjust a personal preference the drip coffee was soso but they have an expresso machine prices are great its a hole in the wall but plenty of parking and the woman at the counter was cheerful open early too while we were there a steady trickle of customers came in everybody likes this place recommended this place is so cool it has a real nice quaint vibe with interesting art and great music the lady who helped us was extremely friendly and made the whole process even better its clean and who doesnt love the smell of fresh made donuts the blueberry fritters crullers bavarian cream donuts and buttermilk donuts are my favorites i now have turned my employes into fans and have to bring a requested list when i come here from the people from work to get their favorites they have very delicious donuts fresh not overly sweet just right good prices and friendly worker large assortment i come for the coffee and service is great im in love with their coffee got a  inch diameter donut totally worth it amazing price you wont get a deal like that anywhere else had it custom made for my girlfriends birthdays which is on national donut day my first time at real donuts was on national donut day i just had to stop in on my way to work it is a hole in the wall in an older shopping center that has seen better days but the store was crowded so i knew i was in the right spot service was quick and everyone was super nice i got a boston creme donut to go and when i got to work and tasted it i knew i had made the right decision i know ill be back perfect for the post night in vegas breakfast crispy buttery flakey goodness the best blueberry fritter i have ever eaten all of their donuts are amazing  so much better than krispy kreme or dunkin donuts now that i found this place ill keep coming back for life  went on friday  to grab some donuts and it just happened to be national donut day and boy was it crowded they have a check in offer right now of  free donut which i had no trouble redeeming i was able to snag a dozen donuts for  which is pretty great this place is kind of a hole in the wall but dont let their building fool youits in an older shopping center and its not the nicest but its clean in a no frills kinda way the workers are tatted up and sometimes they play rap music which i love after eating their donuts for a few months i can say with confidence they are the secondbest donuts ive ever had the crullers are out of this world all the donuts are fresh and flavorful and will melt in your mouth unfortunately they were out of crullers today  and it was about  degrees inside the storei felt really bad for the workers i was sweatin my balls off in there i know people always say some place is the best but real donuts is honestly the best donuts ive ever had every time i come to vegas i have to stop by and get some the people who work there are incredible the prices are amazing and the donuts are the greatest the only thing that has ever made me mad is when i didnt have anymore money to tip after she gave me an extra donut omg must try the iced mocha coconut coffee so freaking good we got maple twist  buttermilk chocolate donut  holy cow its so damn good excellent donuts not much else to say oh and at  each for a gourmet donut  thats a steal i had a most excellent experience the donuts were so fresh moist and flavorful tanya was so friendly and helpful we will definitely be back the best donut in vegas i was being hospitalized at umc hospital and my husband decided to surprise me with real donuts it was my first time having them and now i want them every day hands down best donuts in vegas i am a lover of the donut and this little shop delivers if you find yourself in need of that special place which can provide you with melt in your mouth perfection look no further i must also mention that  for a half dozen is a great deal ive never been a donut person but real donuts could change all that good selection incredible texture delicate flavor and very wellpriced goodbye costly conceited croissants hello delicious decadent donuts i think they have the best donuts to me my boss at work always brings them so i asked one day and told me i decided to go up there one morning nice and early and got me a nice and fresh donut with some milk it really hit the spot cant complain and deff recommend coming here i went for the first time at pm and the donut i got was devils food cake and donut twisted together then glazed dont know what its called it was great i want to go in the morning so they have a wider variety to choose from and really fresh ive been off the donut kick for a while but a visit this morning brought the yummy memories all back i wanted to grab some donuts for coworkers today and real donuts was really convenient its also one of my favorite places in town and its still cheap starting at  for standard donuts and with discounts such as  for half a dozen and even one free with yelp checkin the counter has been streamlined with everything including the cash register along one wall instead of the former lshaped counter that doesnt mean that theyve lowered their variety the selection this particular morning was the most massive that ive seen in my sadly few visits and i was almost late because of trying to decide between all of the options maybe i shouldve gone for that full dozen i started with a blueberry jellyfilled donut this one being a freewithcheckin donut then picked up an applefilled donut i was more partial to the blueberry but both were delicious glazed donuts with plenty of fruity jelly note that these donuts qualify for the free donut and for  of the  you can get in a halfdozen max  in a dozen the blueberry fritter was as stunningly crunchy moist and flavorful as the first time i fell in love with the shop i ate the second one at home for dinner i would have loved to save it for the next morning but it was that irresistible the cake donuts were great with the honey wheat spiced making me regret not doubleordering and the blueberry almost making me forget about donut hut i actually get a little bit more blueberry flavor out of this version but its texture is ever so slightly less palatable the buttermilk donut with raspberry jelly was also really good with its own unique flavor and crunch it was the last one with jelly available and it brought back the memory of the splendid raspberryfilled donut that i forewent today for varietys sake new players have arrived since my last written look at real donuts but i still strongly recommend this shop its one of the best in town and it just so happens to be located centrally in the las vegas valley and just off the highway ill have to stop by more often if i need a sweet treat in the daytime decent fresh donutsperhaps just not aligned with my taste the star review is not for the donuts although they bring it up to  from say a  rather it is missing a fivestar review because of the service and employee attitude im willing to give any business the benefit of the doubt in order to allow for the occasional bad day like all humans are apt to have now and then but in the name of an honest review i must say i was treated as if i was a nuisance and like they couldnt get me out of the store fast enough i barely spoke and only ordered a common order of a coffee and  donuts hopefully my next visit will allow for a th star easily the best donut ive ever had and i am not a fan of donuts at all service was great the lady behind the counter made me feel at home as id never been there before will definitely go back and recommend to others its located on a major thoroughfare between chinatown  downtown but you have to really pay attention  drive slowly or youll miss it  pass right by it is in a mini shopping inlet not quite a strip mall you park right in front easy access whenever i try a new donut shop i order the same  items to compare with other donut shops glazed raised and buttermilk bar reals were really great they had a cinnamon crumb donut which was noteworthy think crumb cake in a donut form impressive selection even midday nothing fancy or modern about real but tasty  great value plus they accept cash or credit card for convenience best anywhere i consider myself a donut expertno im not a cop but the chocolate raised are second to none anywhere very good service warm ppl donuts are delicious big selection like chocolate vanilla apple and donuts with bavarian cream the cream made very well doesnt taste cheap like other places not often get my donut fix in i happen to be in the area and had donuts on my mind so went to trusty yelp search bam real donuts it was my first time talk about never judge book by its cover i would put real donuts in that category it not often in that area but remember before getting health card renewal near umc everything in that area screams yikes not exactly greatest part of town and all the small shopping malls along the area look shady at best the minute pulled into real donuts little shopping area nothing changed for me the store fronts are basicoutdated it all changed once you walk up to the front door and see yelp sticker i think that worthy of one star lol the minute walked in the smell was awesome any kind of bakery always been fan of fresh baked goodies talk about assortment of donuts thankfully went in the early afternoon so had full stock and made the display of donuts pretty awesome the lady that working was super friendly warm welcome soon walked in since first time she like take your time no rush and no doubt five star service it tough just pick couple the only one i do remember the name was the cinnamon crumb glazed donut it reminded me kind of like coffee cake donut it was the first one tasted the other two believe one was cinnamon roll ok the custard filled donut i could just have bowl of custard filling and be in custard bliss the outside was ok but the filling was key for me the interior nothing really modern more outdated i kind of liked it went with the personality of the place besides the checkerboard flooring throwback style the chalkboard sign menus cool texas vs alaskan talk about not joke they had one alaskan style donut in the display and talk about donut for two or three only one might have more in the back but if looking for one ridiculous oversize donut they have it at real donuts if am in the area and get the donut urge real donuts yay this donut shop has got to be the best donut shop in vegas if not the usa you got to taste one to believe that you are in donut heaven trust me great donutsexceptional customer service wowwell worth a trip a little off the strip great donuts good coffee four in the afternoon and still a great variety this place has the best donuts tried krispy kreme dunkin donuts and others but this place has them beat the selection is great and they even have mega huge donuts regardless of what day or time you come in this small shop you will get fresh product wait times are brief especially since its small this location is right across from umc hospital love this place i was so happy to find a place with vegan donuts to indulge in there cinnamon roll donuts my favorite too glad i have somewhere to go for a harm free sweet tooth from time to time they deserve the  star rating here i have been coming here for  years i would not go anywhere else in the whole city real donuts claim to fame are their texas and alaskan donuts the texas is a yeast donut with chocolate icing and sprinkles and is approximately  the size of a grown mans head your average guy can probably devour half the donut without feeling overwhelmed this same donut can also feed  women go figure the alaskan donuts come by special order only so dont think you can just stroll in and grab one the alaskan is nearly the double the size of the texas the apple and blueberry fritters are another popular option in my humble opinion real donuts are the best traditional donuts in all of southern nevada this place exceeded all my expectations i called at a little after  friday morning and asked if they could get  dozen donuts together in about  minutes i arrived shortly after i called and donuts were ready to go not only was the service amazing but the donuts were delicious i will make sure whenever our staff is getting donuts its from here im on a mission a mission to eat all the donuts of the  places ive tried in las vegas in the past  weeks real is my absolute favorite the maple buttermilk bar and old fashioned hit the nail on the head in so many ways tender inside and crispy on the outside with the right amount of sweetness in the glaze while the inside out cinnamon roll wasnt my jam the glazed raised was yeasty and light with a glaze that melted with each bite into your tongue these are the donuts that will haunt my dreams i love this place super delicious donuts and danish great selection at an awesome price with friendly staff what a great way to start the new year what diet i love mom and pop donut shops because i like simplicity i have been disappointed with more popular joints that serve gourmet donuts which usually have too much going on real donuts was recommended to me by ramil b so of course i had to check them out for my first time here i chose the  dozen for  with yelp checkin i got a free donut seven donuts total not bad blueberry fritter inverted chocolate donut buttermilk glazed donut maple donut cinnamon crunch glazed donut overall the

apple fritters is absolutely delicious i just love this place support local businesses mom and pop donut shops are the best stopped in here at about pm the donuts were not the freshest but i cant

donuts and fritters also have mexican breads pan dulce eat everything but the coffee is not that good my rating is really based on the cinnamon roll forget about … more the best cinnamon roll in the world great donuts and fritters also have mexican breads pan dulce eat everything but the coffee is not that good my rating is really based on the cinnamon roll forget about it get the big one best staff donuts coffee in town never have to wait in line always taken care of always this is a small donut shop with a few sitting places you can have a big selection of real homemade donuts if you love sweets especially donuts youll feel like in heaven the blueberry flitters and apple flitters are very yummy i also love the raspberry filled with powdered sugarthe prices are reasonable and the workers are always friendly and helpful they have a yelp check in offer for a free donut and that is really good love this place amazing service so friendly and personable i am always impressed by their donut selection so many choices i will never go anywhere else let me first start off by saying sage the girl working the counter was so so sweet and knowledgable about all the donuts and vegas in general she is the reason for  stars you just dont find nice people anymore everyone is so rude   on to the review great cheap eats in vegas we had  donuts  were free with our yelp checkins score apple fritter  nice texture apple cinnamon flavor but the icing on top made it to sweet for me i dont add sugar to anything so it may be my taste cinnamon crumb cake  pillow soft texture not overly sweet good choice chocolate sprinkle i think the kid in all of us just craves it bf liked it raspberry filled  by far my favorite the raspberry flavor was so potent and yummy they definitely dont skimp on the filling it was bursting out iced chai tea was so good perfectly made once again thanks to sage for all of the local tips and places to eat our bellies will thank you the best customer service brian is so friendly and helpful donuts are good not to die for brian took the time to look up names of local eateries for us he was rockin to billy idol nice guy stumbled upon this donut shop while my friend and i showed up an hour early for class on an empty stomach there is plenty of accessible parking out in front the shop was clean and there was a great selection of fresh donuts i ordered the chocolate bar and chocolate circle donut my friend ordered the chocolate crueller the donuts tasted fresh costed  each  reasonably priced check in on yelp for a free regular or filled donut they also have a gigantic donut for sale in the glass window it looked like the size of  donuts combined would probably come again to try out the big donut  mainly for photos though the service was top notch here i usually dont expect much from donut shops since they dont make much and its early in the morning but this one was different  the kind lady behind the counter was very sweet and smiled often she definitely help make my day a little brighter the cashier over there is fine as hell delicious donuts decent coffee and incredibly friendly service what more need be said well they have some of the best donut holes ive eaten and the crullers are to die for real donuts are real they taste sooooo goood real donuts is like punk rock in pastry form theyre not generic suburban krispy kreme nor are they some frufru fancy urban joint these donuts are angry and out to kick ass from donut holes to texas donuts the size offerings vary plus theyre tasty moist yet not greasy and totally satisfying the only thing keeping me from giving them five stars is the lack of variety that other donut shops have dont get me wrongtheres still a good selection but i suppose i can sacrifice a cronut or donut sandwich if it means i get to make gastronomical love to rd i tried a sugared and a glazed  both were fresh and delicious they have limited seating   tables offers many types of donuts  including an alaska for  incase at am i saw  types of donuts   fritters  and croissants quirky employees who work hard stopping by real donuts is a real treat this last visit i stopped by in the early afternoon and they still had a good variety of donuts available inside is small but it was packed with customers i like that they keep fresh stuff coming out throughout the day the workers are always nice and upbeat there is a checkin offer on yelp for a free regular or filled donut and they are good about honoring it a half dozen donuts only set me back  which is a good price and the donuts tasted great they have coffee and other pastries available also including a couple of donuts that are larger than normal in size and usually require some notice to ensure being able to grab one so call ahead this is a hole in the wall donut shop thats been here for a long time and for good reason its not the decor bringing customers back its the friendly employees fair prices and most of all delicious donuts in my opinion inverted cinnamon roll  this one has swirls of devils food cake in it easily one of my favorite donuts here the donut is just nice and soft and has great flavor id recommend getting at least two inverted chocolate iced  not swirled with devils food cake or cinnamon like the previously mentioned but still sporting princess leia buns covered in chocolate i wish i had saved this one for the following day with my coffee it would have paired better i enjoyed the donut however it was a bit heavier than the nice and soft inverted cinnamon roll and could have handled being dipped in coffee or tea just fine blueberry fritter  very good when i heard they had apple and blueberry i decided to try the blueberry and my hubby went with the apple which i sadly didnt taste i loved the texture of the blueberry fritter and i tasted blueberries in each bite twisted chocolate iced  i picked this one out because it was covered in chocolate and looked good when i got home and took it out of the box it resembled a wiener and balls to me oh well it was tasty and i swallowed the whole thing filled bear claw  very good this donut was a good size and nice and soft with a good amount of apple filling inside they also have smaller bear claws that are not filled if thats your thing raspberry filled  the outside of the donut was glazed nicely and inside there was a fair amount of raspberry filling and it tasted great the shopgirl recommened  inverted cinnamon rolls i bought glazed and sourcream and chocolate and chocolate on coconuts and inverted cinnamon rolls anyway i bought  donuts and price is just  what a reasonable price i love this shop the atmosphere was a traditional shop very simple and tasty and inexpensive wow this is a legit hole in the wall donut joint the donuts are so fresh and the price is definitely right there is a yelp check in offer for a free donut and when i asked the girl behind the counter if she wanted to mark the offer used she said no way sugar we want you to use it every time you come back and thats a nice touch she was friendly and nice about explaining the different donuts to me the wife and i picked out a half dozen plus our free donut each for yelp check in and it was only  which is awesome the bigger bear claws are filled unlike the smaller ones and both are equally delicious im a fan of cinnamon rolls and really enjoyed the inverted cinnamon roll that ribbons of devils food cake running through it no fancy donuts here just classic old fashion donuts of goodness  donuts taste so goood get the inverted cinnamon roll and blueberry fritter and thank me later great donuts friendly service reasonable prices what more can you ask for i definitely will be going back ive yet to find a better place is the city for donuts be sure to try the fritters they have apple pineapple and my favorite blueberry the place ive ever seen them just happened to notice this little donut shop driving by so i stopped in i highly recommend it the donuts are fresh the younger staff is friendly  knowledgable  tons of choices if you like crispy on the outside fritters  soft on the inside they have some of the best the blueberry  is awesome if you like donuts give them a try we ordered  dozen doughnuts for favors at our wedding on may  they were delicious and we received great reviews from our guests  thanks so much i just ate the best doughnut ive had in a long time thanks to all at real donuts a small family owned donut shop amazing service and even better donuts there is something special about there glaze twist donuts there prices are reasonable for a dozen this place is a must go the twenty minute drive is worth it i passed a dozen other donut shops for these donuts taste so goood donuts taste so goood omg so delicious its the only place i will ever go to from this point on i m not much of a donut person i know but this place is just amazing the donuts taste super fresh and theyre really soft too the people are just great and very friendly love it i came in right at opening time on saturday morning the donuts looked fresh and so beautifully unreal i had a maple old fashioned and it was perfect some of donuts are too dry or too moist almost tasting uncooked real donuts gets it just right i bought dozen assorted for my coworkers and will turn these donuts are delicious and priced well real donuts is real great  only had the double chocolate and blueberry cake but both were outstanding  friendly service and clean shop  exact changecash only  i will be back for more the donuts were fresh and delicious the apple fritter was perfectly cooked the cake donuts were a magical blend of crispy and moist my kids approved of the chocolate frosting great doughnuts  very nice people get there early place gets busy blueberry cake doughnut is a favorite i finally gave into my craving for an old fashioned warm sweet donut  walked in a few minutes after closing time and was still able to purchase some yummy fresh donuts  owners son was super sweet and full of personality  will definitely be back we moved here form los angeles and have several great old school donut famous donut spots to choose from it was hard to find a real donut  n vegas until now real donuts is the real deal best spot in town for great donuts no fu fu  stuff just good ole down to earth donuts that you simply cant stop eating  we drive  min one way to get them i think of myself as kind of a donut expert and with all of my experience i can honestly say that this is the best donut place in las vegas though i live  minutes away from this little piece of heaven i cant help but make the trip weekly fresh delicious real sometimes its the little mom and pop local stores that really shine  krispy kreme and dunkin can keep their donuts  for me real donuts is where its at  their shop may be old and small  it may be in a rough and sketchy looking area  but damn are their donuts good  they are bigger than those which come from a large chain store  they are also fresh and delicious with a more nostalgic  reminding me of the old shops back home i used to go to as a kid  on top of that they offer a gigantic donut that is as big as my face  thats just cool  last time i was in there i could hear some good hard rock coming from the back  i found myself headbanging by the time i left  ah good times  i feel fortunate that real donuts is close to work for me  a simple jaunt across the street from umc and you have arrived we came into town for the weekend and decided to go get some donuts i would call myself a connoisseur of apple fritterstheir apple fritter was amazing the woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful we purchased a dozen and each donut was fresh and delicious  i higjl youve never really had a donut until youve had a real donut you can taste the freshness and brian is always a bubbly joy to see just go here and get donuts for everyone you know they will love you forever my favorite crunchie raised apple fritter or cinnamon butterfly i love these donuts reminds of a place i used to go back home in texas the staff is very friendly oh lawd oh no child this is so good its bad my hips are going to be so mad at me for ever coming to this place i have eaten   donuts since we got our box which was only  minutes ago i will definitely be coming back to this place so close to work and very good quality donuts my boyfriend and i were thinking about going to a different donut place on lunch but we didnt like how greasy they normally are we were driving around work seeing what other places we could check out we decided to drive down charleston and passed by a place called real donuts we were thinking real donuts as opposed to fake donuts we stopped in and there was a super friendly person in front i saw a ton of cake and crumb donuts my two favorites heaven already after looking around we were asking a ton of questions wondering what we should get we planned on only getting a few maybe one for him and one for me well that went out the window real quick we started with a blueberry cake with white icing then moved to a bavarian creme filled chocolate glazed donut after that it was all bad we found out that they had a blueberry fritter my boyfriends favorite thing in the world we got two of those we got an orange glazed cake donut a crumb cake donut a crumb covered apple cinnamon filled one we decided to just go with the dozen at that point and decided to get everyone on our team donuts we got a cinnamon roll a cinnamon roll mixed with devils food cake some swirly one that i forgot what it was a chocolate cake donut with chocolate icing a regular cake donut with chocolate icing i honestly dont remember all of the donuts that we got but the guy in front ended up throwing another one in for free then we asked about one last donut and he ended up throwing that in for free too so awesome i was weary of the orangeglazed donut but it was so amazing it tasted like a creamsicle the blueberry cake donut was so flavorful i couldnt believe it i really am stuffed and my whole team was raving about how good the donuts were i didnt want to end up eating all of the leftovers for sake of my hips so i walked around my office and started handing them out everyone was talking about how good they were i will definitely be coming back the service was great the quality of the donuts was amazing and the flavor was perfect i cant wait to come back and try all of the other donuts we didnt get this time this place is pretty awesome they make a lot of donuts so much that the next day they offer   of them for five bucks if you are looking for dependably decent donuts and you are in the area if recommend it just be aware its no ronalds donuts this is a good second thoughtied with masters donuts this place brings back memories of my childhood when my mom would take me to the little donut shop on saturday mornings i love the little hole in the wall family owned joints so much better than chain places this spot has been on my radar since i saw pics from terris donut crawl i got the maple bar and a regular glazed donut both were soft sugary treats which i inhaled in less than  minutes i dont eat too many donuts for obvious health reasons but these were probably at the top of my list for donut spots in vegas dont forget your yelp check in for a free donut will for sure be back on my cheat days im a little stunned that i havent been to real donuts before because ive spent a lot of time nearby it took until i had enjoyed one of their creations through a reseller the goodwich that i really experienced the magic regular donuts are  each but nobody is really going to buy just one more likely options are a dozen regular donuts for  max  jellyfilled donuts and half a dozen donuts for   jellyfilled they have higher prices for fancies  i was actually looking for the dayold donuts but missed the boat on it i guess they must sell out of those close to their opening hour of am your time to shine early risers so yeah that blueberry fritter it was my magical introduction to real donuts its not apple which is also good its better sweet moist crunchy blueberryy not sure what more you can ask for except a second i also tried the raspberry jellyfilled donut and the maple cruller on day  there is an absurd amount of jelly in the middle of that treat but thankfully its not too sweet the cruller is pretty airy and reminds me of cream puff dough almost feels like a healthy option almost next day i finished the rest of the donuts off i guess i got the dayold donuts that i wanted after all the orange cream glazed donut was okay but didnt stand out the cinnamon raisin bun was still very moist and it was sweet without having a huge portion of glaze as you might see as other places the oldfashioned chocolate donut was pretty average too note to self skip finally blueberry fritter  was just as awesome as the first definitely would recommend real donuts for people who are in the area or who are donut fans havent thoroughly explored the rest of the vegas donut scene but im already pretty confident this place will end up as one of the mainstays really one of the best places for donuts here in vegas i absolutely love the blueberry filled and the inverted cinnamon donuts they are perfectly sweet to me since some donut shop donuts can be super sweet dont forget the checkin deal for yelpers you wont be disappointed in these donuts doughnuts donuts dog nutswhatever you call them for the most part theyre all tasty well maybe not dog nuts lets get real this place is like a fried dough time machine and i love it real donuts definitely keeps it real from the wood paneling on the walls to the  doughnut its like walking into the wonder years tv show i originally came here for the inverted cinnamon rolls but found myself buying up pretty much everything in the display case the maple  peanut covered cinnamon rolls cherry frosted french crullers bear claws the classic simpsons doughnut pink frosting  sprinkles maple bars and nearly everything inbetween not to forgot my savory side i also bought a jalapeño croissant stuffed with turkey swiss cheese and chunks of my favorite spicy pepper this was delicious the bread was super soft and i was told it was made fresh that morning sure tasted like it this treat is a must if your taste buds like to live on the spicy side before i left i asked about the two giant doughnuts that looked like they were drawn on a board behind the cash register one is called the texas which is a giant glazed doughnut about  inches in diameter the other doughnut is called the alaskan this is what looks like a  inch fried piece of heaven im not sure but sadly it didnt matter the texas was sold out and the alaskan is madetoorder next time my doughnut loving friends it was a quiet little donut shop with a very friendly lady working there she was nice and greeted all the customers by their names it smelled so good like fresh cooked goodness i bought a dozen and a half donuts and a dozen donut holes for the people i work with it was a reasonable price at  the donuts were very fresh and warm i had the lady working just give me a mix of everything i had a round one with chocolate frosting and orange sprinkles for halloween it was very tasty i also had a few or half the bag of donut holes and they were just as tasty i would definitely go back and would recommend this place to my friends donuts are consistently great  always fresh and never too greasy  they always have a huge variety to choose from also  love this place the employees made me laugh the entire time i was there i appreciate entertainment while i wait the donuts were mouthwatering and fresh i bought three dozen donuts to feed a class of folks and they were nearly gone within an hour people including me were going back for seconds i have been going here for years the best way to start your day fresh yummy and the prices are great good donuts really good super fresh the place was crowded with locals staff was friendly would go back for sure awesome place swooped in right before they closed and i tried an orange frosted donut i already love pink frosting but orange is my new favorite lady was super nice also what a sweet place to have sweets ha i couldnt believe it  we checked in and we got  specialty donuts for   how is that possible   owners are super friendly  everything was very tasty  we especially liked the fritters blueberry and regular and the apple filled first time at real donuts the costumer service was fabulous really enjoyed my time ordering donuts lol our clinic went on a donut adventure we order their top sellers and let me tell you they are all worth the calories before jayz and kanye west there was rundmc before justin timberlake and justin bieber there was michael jackson before coldplay there was ubefore root beer float donuts and maple bacon bars there were real donuts  not to say the course of donut history hasnt taken a turn for the delicious or creative but sometimes its good to remember the original  a stroll through this little shop across the street from the university medical center one does not need to crank their delorean flux capacitor to  gigawatts to go back in time to taste how donuts were made back in the day since the folks here have been making them the same way every day without infusing pop rocks into their custard or sprinkling green tea powder or ruining a perfect slice of bacon on top of their donuts  these are the donuts that sat atop starsky and hutchs dashboard or within the nuclear power plant control room of homer simpson   old school donuts done correctly and beyond reasonably priced  not the subtle sweetlocally sourced ingredientsbrioche dough modern donuts that are all the rage but the sinfully sweet unabashedly artificial variety that melts in your mouth due to the embarrassingly high sugar content  made fresh every morning perfect for dunking into a cup of cheap drip coffee   highlights are the airy french crullers the impossibly crispy fritters the blueberry variety is exceptional as well as old favorites like the sour cream donut buttermilk bar and the enigmatic inverted cinnamon roll which contains a strokestreak of geniusdevils food cake  the folks behind the counter are extremely friendly and they open at the crack of dawn so you know they take great pride in starting every local las vegans day off on the right foot  grab a dozen for your coworkers and you will be the most beloved person in the office  its comforting to know some things are not meant to change so be sure to support this local gem maybe it depends on what you get  i tried the blueberry fritter and tasted very crispy like burnt  so luckily i also got the inverted cinnamon roll type of donut and that was superb   very soft and chewy sweet and cinnamony  the donuts are priced right and the guy was super nice at the counter  i can see people being fabulous and getting some for their coworkers the first thing youll notice when you walk in are the two glass cases full of beautifully decorated oldschool donuts to be fair thats probably all youll pay attention to at any donut shop but the variety here is pretty extensive regular and inverted cinnamon rolls they kind of resemble brains classic and cake donuts a plenty sprinkle and frostingtopped versions for purists and fancies like maple bars no bacon here buttermilk bars a surprise hit giant bear claws and eclairs anything with fruit is generally really well done here too im not even really much of a donut fan but this place gets an extra star for not pulling that cashonly bs that other places do also theyre open til pm these are straight up delicious donuts none of that fancy crap just the good stuff its a hole in the wall establishment and youd miss it if you werent specifically looking for it the price is good nothing outrageous the cake donuts are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside i just got the blueberry muffin cake donut and it rocked my world seriously the service is amazing every time the guy i dont know his name i feel like a jerk about that even recommended a great band portugal the man awesome donut joint  it has an old school feel to it we saw it on the way to an errand we were running and decided to double back and get a few donuts  they have  employees there and they are super friendly  if you check in here you get a free donut code  my phone died right after i showed it to her and snapped a few photos but the lady there still gave me the free donut  it seems that this restaurant has been here for awhile  it has a well worn out look to it but the donuts are crazy delicious  they have this donut called an alaskan donut that is about as big as your head  i opted for the much smaller donutsan apple critterchocolate on chocolate and a blueberry fritter check it out if your on that side of town ihaveneverhadabetterdonut this place is amazing seriously the best donut shop in the state you can custom order giant donuts texas  alaska sizes you will not be disappointed my children are addicted to this place we all are the donuts that you like that is your favorite just call before hand youll love tonyas cakes she has a killer skill in making

sprinkled airy donuts to serve there are too may treats for me to list but the rainbow array caught my attention thank you michelle for attentive service      thank you blvds magazine your voice was
