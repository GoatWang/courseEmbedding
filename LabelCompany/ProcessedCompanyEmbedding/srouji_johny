most important apple executive you’ve never heard of a visit with cupertino’s chief chipmaker johny srouji by brad stone adam satariano and gwen ackerman  february   photographs by justin kaneps for bloomberg businessweek from a little over a year ago apple had a problem the ipad pro was behind schedule elements of the hardware software and accompanying stylus weren’t going to be ready for a release in the spring chief executive officer tim cook and his top lieutenants had to delay the unveiling until the fall that gave most of apple’s engineers more time it gave a littleknown executive named johny srouji much less srouji is the senior vice president for hardware technologies at apple he runs the division that makes processor chips the silicon brains inside the iphone ipad apple watch and apple tv the original plan was to introduce the ipad pro with apple’s tablet chip the ax the same processor that powered the ipad air  introduced in  but delaying until fall meant that the pro would make its debut alongside the iphone s which was going to use a newer faster phone chip called the a featured in bloomberg businessweek feb   subscribe now photographer justin kaneps for bloomberg businessweek this is the stuff that keeps technology executives up at night the ipad pro was important it was apple’s attempt to sell tablets to business customers and it would look feeble next to the iphone s so srouji put his engineers on a crash program to move up the rollout of a new tablet processor the ax by half a year the engineers finished in time and the pro hit the market with the faster chip and a inch display packed with  million pixels srouji was nicely rewarded for his efforts in december he became the newest member of cook’s management team and received about  additional shares of apple stock which vest over a fouryear period he also stepped into the kind of spotlight he’s avoided since joining apple in  srouji runs what is probably the most important and least understood division inside the world’s most profitable company since  when his team produced the a chip for the original ipad apple has immersed itself in the costly and complex science of silicon it develops specialized microprocessors as a way to distinguish its products from the competition the appledesigned circuits allow the company to customize products to perfectly match the features of its software while tightly controlling the critical tradeoff between speed and battery consumption among the components on its chip technically called a “system on a chip” or soc are an image signal processor and a storage controller which let apple tailor useful functions for taking and storing photos such as the rapidfire “burst mode” introduced with the iphone s engineers and designers can work on features like that years in advance without prematurely notifying vendors—especially samsung which manufactures many of apple’s chips at the center of all this is srouji  an israeli who joined apple after jobs at intel and ibm he’s compact he’s intense and he speaks arabic hebrew and french his english is lightly accented and when the subject has anything to do with apple nonspecific bordering on koanlike “hard is good easy is a waste of time” he says when asked about increasingly thin iphone designs “the chip architects at apple are artists the engineers are wizards” he answers another question he’ll elaborate a bit when the topic is general “when designers say ‘this is hard’ ” he says “my rule of thumb is if it’s not gated by physics that means it’s hard but doable” srouji recently spent several hours with bloomberg businessweek over several days and guided a tour of apple chip facilities in cupertino calif and herzliya israel this was no doubt strategic investors have battered apple stock over the past year sending it down more than  percent most people are already pretty satisfied with their phones the criticism goes and aren’t compelled to spend an additional few hundred bucks on an upgrade in march apple intends to announce an updated ipad and smallerscreen iphone featuring the latest ax and a chips according to a person familiar with the plans who wasn’t authorized to comment publicly apple’s usual response is to point to jony ive and his team of fastidiously cool wallabeeshod industrial designers or to highlight elegantly tooled aluminum or an app or some new feature or gadget there’s always something new to show off but none of that has ever explained anything about a crucial part of apple’s profit machine its chips “i think it’s too good of a story not to be told at this stage” srouji says “hopefully we won’t reveal too much” in israel srouji second from left and cook right with apple employees source apple when the original iphone came out in  steve jobs was well aware of its flaws it had no front camera measly battery life and a slow g connection from att it was also underpowered a former apple engineer who worked on the device said that while the handset was a breakthrough technology it was limited because it pieced together components from different vendors including elements from a samsung chip used in dvd players “steve came to the conclusion that the only way for apple to really differentiate and deliver something truly unique and truly great you have to own your own silicon” srouji says “you have to control and own it” one of jobs’s trusted advisers bob mansfield apple’s top hardware executive at the time recruited srouji to lead that effort srouji then at ibm was a rising star in the arcane world of semiconductor engineering mansfield promised him an opportunity to build something from scratch the decision to design semiconductors was risky about the size of a small postage stamp the microprocessor is the most important component of any computing device it does the work that makes playing games posting to facebook sending texts and taking pictures seem easy small currents of energy move from the battery through hundreds of millions of tiny transistors triggering commands and responses in nanoseconds it’s like an intricate city design that fits on the tip of your finger when the chip isn’t doing its job efficiently the device feels sluggish crashes or makes users want to throw it against a wall if there’s a bug in software you simply release a corrected version it’s different with hardware “you get one transistor wrong it’s done game over” srouji says “each one of those transistors has to work silicon is very unforgiving” among computer and smartphone makers industry practice is to leave the processors to specialists such as intel qualcomm or samsung which sink billions into getting the chips right and making them inexpensively apple used to codesign processors for the macintosh but jobs abandoned the work in  in favor of more powerful models from intel whose chips still power all macs when srouji joined apple the company had a group of about  engineers working on integrating chips from various vendors into the iphone that grew by about  people in april  after apple acquired a silicon valley chip startup called pa semi which had a powerefficient semiconductor design srouji’s team found itself interacting regularly with other departments from software programmers who wanted chip support for new features to ive’s industrial designers who wanted help making the phones flatter and sleeker an engineer who sat in on srouji’s meetings remembers senior managers preparing extensively for presentations because his support was critical for getting new features approved he was known for peppering engineers with technically sophisticated questions particularly about contingency options if something didn’t work out as planned he’d ask for example if a different form of plastic could be used that wouldn’t interfere with another component “the only way for apple to really differentiate and deliver something truly unique and truly great you have to own your own silicon” the first public signs of srouji’s work came in  with the debut of the ipad and iphone  the processor the a was a modified version of a design from arm holdings a british company that licenses mobile technology the a was designed to power the handset’s new highdefinition “retina display” srouji says it was a race to get that first systemonachip produced “the airplane was taking off and i was building the runway just in time” he says over the next few years apple kept making improvements to its designs introducing chips to accommodate fingerprint identification video calling and siri the iphone’s voiceactivated assistant among other enhancements when the companies using google’s android operating system started making tablets they mostly used conventional mobile phone processors starting with the thirdgeneration ipad in  srouji’s team designed specific chips the ax and ax to give the tablet the same pixelpacking highdefinition screens as the iphone these mysterious semiconductors coming from apple were the curiosity of the tech industry but it wasn’t until the release of the iphone s in  that rivals really started to pay attention the phone featured the a processor the first smartphone chip with  bits—double the bit standard at the time the new technology allowed for entirely new features such as apple pay and the touch id fingerprint scanner developers had to rewrite applications to account for the new standard but it gave way to smoother maps cooler video games and generally more responsive apps that don’t hog as much memory apple’s control over hardware and software is also useful for encrypting everything on the device a capability that has landed the company in a controversy on feb  a judge ruled that apple must help the fbi unlock an iphone owned by one of the san bernardino shooters apple is fighting the order saying it would set a precedent that would undermine the privacy of all its customers qualcomm then as now the biggest designer of phone chips made the expensive decision to scrap development of its bit chips and put all its resources into catching up handset companies all “wanted the shiny new thing” says ryan smith the editorinchief of anandtech a website that publishes exhaustive reviews of semiconductor designs “the a really turned the world upside down” srouji can’t restrain a smile when recalling competitors’ reactions to apple’s bit surprise “when we pick something” he says “it’s because we think there’s a problem that nobody can do or there is some idea that’s so unique and differentiating that the best way to do it is you have to do it yourself” chipdurability testing at an unmarked apple lab in cupertino photographer justin kaneps for bloomberg businessweek srouji was born in haifa a port city in northern israel he was the third child of four his family was christian arab a minority within a minority in the jewish state “haifa is one of the most integrated cities in israel” he says “you have christians you have muslims jews bahá’ís you have any religion you want and everyone lives together in peaceful harmony integration worked for me” srouji’s father owned a metal patternmaking business outside the city and from age  srouji spent weekends and summers helping him pattern wooden moldings that were used to make engine parts medical equipment and other machinery his father had an unusual philosophy he would undercharge customers for complicated work while overcharging for easier jobs “if there was a very complex thing that he’d never done he wanted to do it” srouji says his father who died in  constantly reminded him not to get comfortable in the family business education was more important in high school srouji got perfect grades in math physics chemistry and science he was introduced to computers by an instructor who also taught at the nearby technion israel institute of technology one of the world’s top engineering schools “i fell in love” srouji says he enrolled at the technion spent late nights in the computer lab drafting out code in pencil and earned undergraduate and master’s degrees in computer science his master’s thesis was on new techniques for testing software and hardware systems “at the time it was very progressive” says orna berry general manager of the emc center of excellence in israel and corporate vice president of innovation who met srouji at the technion “i’m not surprised he is where he is” after graduating srouji got a job with ibm which had placed its largest nonus research facility in haifa the better to attract the big brains coming out of the technion and other israeli universities he researched distributed systems an emerging field in which computers in different locations are networked together to complete computationally intensive assignments ensuring the machines communicated correctly required skill building hardware and writing software algorithms “sometimes i wondered—when he got an assignment and within a day it was complete and perfect—if he was brilliant or just didn’t sleep at night” says srouji’s first boss oded cohn vice president and lab director for ibm haifa research “in some cases the conclusion was both” although israel grapples with jewisharab tensions all the time none of it mattered in srouji’s world cohn who remains friends with him says their different backgrounds never came up “technical people treat technical people based on personality and technical ability” he says “you don’t think about it you just work together the rest goes away” in  srouji left ibm for intel where he created techniques for running simulations that test the strength of semiconductor designs during a visit to the us in  he used a minute car ride with a manager fellow israeli uri weiser to lobby for a threeyear stint at intel’s research hub in austin assuming srouji was also jewish weiser invited him to an israeli memorial day celebration at a synagogue in texas “he looked at me and said ‘i’m a christian arab’ ” recalls weiser who gave srouji the texas assignment “i said ‘well come and join and learn about your environment’ and he said ok he was there sitting with a kippah in the synagogue and following everything” standing in an aisle surrounded by exposed circuit boards and digital innards is like being inside the matrix “no one has seen this before” srouji says srouji lives a few miles from apple’s headquarters at one infinite loop cupertino he drives a black mercedesbenz and relaxes by lifting weights and riding his bike on weekends he smiles easily warmly touches a reporter’s shoulder when sharing a laugh blushes at compliments and absolutely clams up when he’s asked about anything that could remotely be considered a corporate secret “i don’t want to go into too much detail on that” is a common refrain friends have noticed the heightened discretion srouji once invited his former intel colleague weiser to give a speech about chip development at apple headquarters in cupertino after the presentation an assistant escorted weiser to srouji’s empty office where he noticed that the papers on the desk were all turned upside down then srouji entered the room and told weiser he had to move “he said ‘we are at apple you can’t sit here’ ” weiser recalls “he offered me to sit with his secretary and said ‘if you want to go to the bathroom she will escort you’ ” one morning in february srouji conducts a brief tour of his domain which is scattered in unmarked locations around silicon valley a shuttle bus leaves one infinite loop and drives  minutes through a series of residential neighborhoods to a lowrise office building near the santa clara city limits one of his deputies greets srouji at the bus and badges through several locked doors into a room where future chip designs are being tested the building is eerily quiet and still save for the hum of air conditioners and the blinking red and green lights of large dark boxes that are stacked together and resemble zambonis the room is applewhite and clean but not tidy thick wires and large plugs lie around old unused macs are lined up on a shelf like books that have already been read all the equipment is operated remotely the boxes are running software that scans for possible flaws in the chip architecture testing proceeds for several days on one element of the chip then moves on to the next and then the next until the process is done which can take months “we beat the silicon as much as we can” srouji says “if you’re lucky and rigorous you find the mistakes before you ship” in an adjacent room circuit boards are wired together in milk cartonsize stacks to simulate the capabilities of a future iphone or ipad apple’s software programmers sitting anywhere in the world can remotely test how their code holds up against a future chip design then the shuttle takes srouji a few more miles away to another unmarked building where rows of customized mac minis are testing prototype chips under various temperature and pressure conditions standing in an aisle surrounded by exposed circuit boards and digital innards is like being inside the matrix “no one has seen this before” srouji says everything looks exceedingly complicated srouji won’t discuss costs but apple’s research and development expenses hit  billion last year up from  billion in  and  billion in  many analysts attribute the rise in large part to chip development all srouji will say about his budget is that cook doesn’t scrutinize it “i run it very tight” he says “i truly believe that engineers will do their best when they are constrained by either money tools or resources if you become sloppy because you have too much money that’s the wrong mindset” apple isn’t completely in charge of its own destiny it remains in many ways a prisoner of its supply chain displays come from samsung and cellular modems from qualcomm samsung and tsmc based in taiwan still manufacture the processors apple’s ability to keep up with demand is in part dependent on the production capacity of those companies it also lags behind samsung in some areas of chip development such as adding a modem to the central processor to conserve space and power and transitioning from a nanometer chip design to a more compact nanometer format which means even more transistors can be crammed into a smaller space “if i was just arguing hardware and not apple’s marketing i would say samsung has the best processor” says mike demler a senior mobile chips analyst at the linley group a technology consulting firm in silicon valley or apple could just be getting started it relies on suppliers for wifi modems now but will it forever “i don’t want to go into wifi specifically” srouji says apple could also take a page from tesla’s playbook and start developing its own batteries “i don’t want to get into batteries too deeply” he says and since apple is doing a fine job with mobile processors it could conceivably decide to get into conventional chips and bump intel out of its mac laptops and desktops srouji of course won’t go there though he does allow that his team’s mission is finite “if we attempt to do everything on the planet” he says “i don’t think that would be very smart” —with reporting by ian king editor jim aleyproducers sheryl sulistiawan and

 facebook linkedin twitter email print ap apples chip program is the center of intense speculation in the technology industry because so little is known about it part of the reason apple has been able to keep the details of its chipmaking under wraps is that the man who runs it johny srouji is great at keeping secrets according to a profile of srouji in bloomberg the secrecy applies even to sroujis office srouji once invited his former intel colleague uri weiser to give a speech about chip development at apple headquarters in cupertino after the presentation an assistant escorted weiser to sroujis empty office where he noticed that the papers on the desk were all turned upside down then srouji entered the room and told weiser he had to move he said we are at apple you cant sit here weiser recalls he offered me to sit with his secretary and said if you want to go to the bathroom she will escort you apple designs the chips that power the iphone and the ipad a technical feat that gives apple a significant advantage for example the fact that apple designs its own chips allowed the company to ship a modern fingerprint reader on a phone a year before its competitors srouji is critical to those efforts which is why apple gave him a major promotion in the past year that came with  shares of apple stock heres one example of how critical srouji is last year apples businessfocused ipad pro was behind schedule and missed its expected spring release date sroujis team was able to develop an entirely new ipad pro chip so it wouldnt look underpowered next to that years iphones when it finally launched in the fall according to the bloomberg report apples chipmaking research happens both in unmarked labs in silicon valley as well as in labs in sroujis native israel the chip labs allow apple engineers to remotely test their code from anywhere in the world on the latest chip designs so they know whether future features will work well on whatever silicon will power the next iphone or ipad one of sroujis unmarked labs featured rows of customized mac minis  testing prototype chips under various temperature and pressure conditions according to bloombergs report there are three main possibilities that might answer the question of what apple might do with its chipmaking prowess apple could start developing its own modems apple could start developing its own batteries apple could release a mac computer running on an appledesigned arm chip but srouji is great at keeping corporate secrets and he declined to talk to bloomberg about any of the three

inconvenience having a nearby apple retail store arguably in business the only win or fail is financial results its not whether the apple watch is a perfect product or that it hasnt sold as many units as i imagine it should or whether i personally would own one  success is predicated on whether the product is profitable whether it met or exceeded sales targets did they make too many or not enough whether customers are satisfied with their purchase and so will buy more of the companys products etc in an imperfect world success or failure cannot be judged on the basis of imagined perfection it doesnt exist so what one imagines as perfection is besides the point all one can do is strive one could pick and choose all the great features of all the competing products wrap them up in a package and imagine the greatest product in the world but it doesnt exist each feature comes at a cost and costisnoobject is not reasonable in the end utility not perfection is what matters is it good enough to do the job in a satisfying manner or do users seek better elsewhere do benefits outweigh shortcomings one also has to question whether winner takes all best product based on reviews etc is ever reasonable first place doesnt necessarily make second place a failure other than that it failed to take first place are maps siri and apple pay a success how do you measure that its deeply integrated

drivepull them tofrom the competition in significant numbers before it can be judged a success or failure in and of itself while we have statistics on maps utilization high rates of usage on ios devices since its a captive product that number tells us little about consumer preference i dont think theres publiclyavailable hard data there that suggests the quality of maps is either hurting or helping apple internet gripes are not exactly hard data apples overall customer satisfaction numbers have not changed much one way or the other since maps siri or apple pay were introduced but considering how high satisfaction numbers are to begin with its pretty hard to make a dent on the upside improved satisfaction by  means less than a single percentage point move in the satisfaction ratings maps siri apple pay these arent even monetizable products theyre features intended to improve the overall appeal of other products apple undoubtedly has plenty of internal metrics on featurebyfeature utilization and customer satisfaction but external numbers are harder to come by if as a major shareholder i could get information to which the rest of the shareholding public is not privy i and the company would be in violation of insider trading laws in the absence of information the phrase arbitrary and capricious comes to mind so lets bring it back to financial results tim cook has presided over historically great financial results on numbers alone there are few in history who match that performance hundreds of billions in profits hundreds of billions in excess cash increased dividends huge share buybacks returning value to shareholders would you fire that person because you can imagine even better than historic results not likely you might fire a person for malfeasance or insubordination there may be tens of millions of people on this planet with the intelligence and skills to lead apple given the opportunities necessary to reach that particular place i certainly wont say that tim cook is the one person who ought to be leading apple he has the job and the company has been doing very very well during his tenure if i was that hypothetical large shareholder id be asking him what do you need in order to do an even better job rating  votes macnewbie  months ago and this is exactly why you will never be apples ceo or any companys ceo for that matter i would rather not work for directly a bunch of shareholders but thank you personally i prefer family businesses instead such as wegmans wegmans treats their employees well stays up to date on technology and also treats their customers well when you shop for the shareholders profits they dont care about you the customerbut just screwing you out of your money with nothing in return when you shop for a familys business you get great customer service and appreciation this is why people prefer to use a credit union over a bank a bank works for shareholders and does everything possible to maximize profits theyll rip you apart with ridiculous fees and the customer service will be mediocre at best unless youre lucky the credit union works for you and not shareholders who are actually the members of the credit union so they work for the members i wish more companies would be nonforprofit or family owned rating  votes stupotpot  months ago when i was in high school every other student had an ipod i havent met one person with an apple watch i havent seen one person thats heard of apple pay or even used it in over a year success and failure judged on whether you know someone with an apple watch or have seen someone use apple pay ive seen people use apple pay on an apple watch does that mean apple isnt failing anymore  i also have two apple stores within  mile of where i live this

thursday february    am pst by joe rossignol bloomberg businessweek has published an indepth profile of apple senior vice president johny srouji that reveals how the ipad pro was originally planned for a spring  launch with the same ax chip powering the ipad air  the inch tablet was running behind schedule however and apple ultimately decided to delay announcing the device until late  at its annual iphone event apple realized the inch tablet would seem lacking alongside the abased iphone s so srouji and his team were challenged to fasttrack development of the ax chip by half a year the chip was ultimately finished on time and srouji was rewarded with a promotion to apples executive team as senior vice president of hardware technologies and  rsus in december appledesigned chipsets allow the company to deeply integrate hardware and software on iphones and ipads but srouji admitted that silicon development is not easyif there’s a bug in software you simply release a corrected version it’s different with hardware “you get one transistor wrong it’s done game over” srouji says “each one of those transistors has to work silicon is very unforgiving” among computer and smartphone makers industry practice is to leave the processors to specialists such as intel qualcomm or samsung which sink billions into getting the chips right and making them inexpensivelyapple did not always develop its own chips as the profile explains the original iphone for example used components from different vendors including a samsung chip used in dvd players“steve came to the read full

apple in  as head of worldwide procurement becomes apples fourth clevel executive alongside ceo tim cook chief financial officer luca maestri and chief design officer jony ive as vice president of

your sagan on with these  aweinspiring photos of the final frontier apple iphone x  rumors and news apple watch  news and rumors samsung galaxy note  news and rumors making sense of it all smartphone specs and terms explained what do the latest ipad apple tv and iphone all share in common they sport systems on a chip socs whose designs were supervised by johny srouji apple’s senior vice president for hardware technologies he’s the executive charged with overseeing the creation of the proprietary processors that power apple’s many mobile products the a with the release of the ipad the ax alongside the ipad air  in  and most recently the ax with the ipad pro to name a few apple’s hardware division has lately taken a backseat in terms of publicity to say johnny ive’s design labs and angela ahrendts’ retail operation but srouji led bloomberg on a tour of the iphone maker’s chip design process at apple’s cupertino california and herzliya israel chip facilities this week the tidbits are tantalizing srouji a graduate of israel’s technion is certain an accomplished fellow his december promotion to his current position of vice president makes him the highestranking israeli in silicon valley according to the haaretz newspaper he’s fluent in arabic hebrew and french but perhaps more fascinating than the man is the division he built from the ground up the first iphone srouji explains was essentially cobbled together from offtheshelf parts — parts that included a samsung chip used in dvd players “steve jobs came to the conclusion that the only way for apple to really differentiate and deliver something truly unique and truly great you have to own your own silicon” he told bloomberg “you have to control and own it” apple’s thenhardware executive bob mansfield recruited srouji to lead an inhouse overhaul of apple’s semiconductor efforts and in the short span of a year srouji spearheaded the acquisition of silicon valley chip startup pa semi and grew the the company’s hardware division from  engineers to  from that point on silicon development accelerated srouji’s team designed the a the heart of the ipad and iphone  specifically to accommodate the latter’s retina display the subsequent ipadpowering ax and ax chips were similarly tailored to help apple’s newer ipads keep up with the processing demands of their highresolution displays srouji’s headliner though was arguably the a the first smartphone chip with  bits it took the industry by surprise chipmaker qualcomm which at the time lacked an answer to apple’s new architecture started investing significantly in the development of a competitive product “the chip architects at apple are artists the engineers are wizards” said srouji “when we pick something it’s because we think there’s a problem that nobody can do or there is some idea that’s so unique and differentiating that the best way to do it is you have to do it yourself” the team achieved another silicon miracle last year with the debut of the ipad pro’s a the tablet’s stylus software and other hardware issues forced apple to push back the launch of the pro from spring  to the fall of that year initial plans called for the pro to pack the ax the processor found in the ipad air  but srouji’s team took the delay as an opportunity to shift the ax’s release forward it debuted alongside the iphone s’s a srouji describes the chipmaking process as a difficult balance between the features apple’s software programmers request and space constraints imposed by the company’s industrial designers his team’s custom designs have enabled such functionality as the rapidfire photo burst mode video calling an alwayson voice assistant and an optimized battery and storage but ultimately the fundamentals are essential “you get one transistor wrong it’s done game over” he said “each one of those transistors has to work” to prevent any unpleasant surprises when apple’s new silicon ships in its latest iphones and ipads the company’s hardware team subjects candidate chip designs to rigorous tests large remotely operated boxes described as resembling “zambonis” scan for potential errors in candidate chip architectures for up to months at a time they’re then tested under extreme conditions and temperatures srouji’s philosophy is one of optimism though “when designers say ‘this is hard’ my rule of thumb is if it’s not gated by physics that means it’s hard but doable” apple  digital trends dt digital trends dt digital trends apple weekly rewind battery breakthroughs gamechanging evs floating solar

december    pm pt  pm et after playing integral roles in two of apples most important product innovations— its custom aseries processors and the touch id fingerprint sensor— johny srouji has been rewarded with a new title that sees him reporting directly to ceo tim cook as part of a series of changes among apples top brass srouji has been named senior vice president of hardware technologies the title makes him the newest member of apples executive team an arabisraeli from the city of haifa srouji earned bachelors and masters degrees in computer science at technion— israel institute of technology prior to joining apple he worked in silicon design at both intel where he was senior manager of its israel design center and ibm as director of development of its power  processor unit when he started at apple sroujis title was senior director of handheld chips and vlsi verylargescale integration it was in that role that he spearheaded development of the a processor a landmark achievement for apple that paved the way for advancements in future iphones and ipadsapples johny srouji left with israel president reuven rivlin credit amos bengershom israel government press office apples silicon development originally led to the a its first customdesigned system on a chip debuting in the ipad in  since then apples electricity sipping cpus have become even more powerful most notably with the desktopclass ax processor found in the inch ipad pro srouji was also involved in creating the first touch id fingerprint sensor apple first introduced in the iphone s in  according to israeli publication haaretz his expertise doesnt stop there however apple also noted that he has also overseen inhouse developments of new battery storage and display technology sroujis appointment to senior vice president hardware technologies puts his title essentially on par with dan riccio apples senior vice president of hardware engineering riccio has been with apple since  and currently leads the mac iphone ipad and ipod engineering teams in years past apples semiconductor teams were overseen by bob mansfield also a hardware engineer but in  he relinquished his role on apples executive team taking on a smaller position working on special projects under cook the ceo sroujis new more visible role at apple only serves to emphasize the importance of the companys inhouse silicon development a key hardware facet that helps to differentiate its products from competitors beyond the aseries chips in the iphone and ipad apple also has custom mseries motion coprocessors for advanced lowpower sensors and the s silicon that powers the apple watch there have also been recent rumors that apple could begin offering its own proprietary graphics processors as part of its aseries chips apple currently uses slightly modified powervr designs from imagination technologies but an inhouse gpu could allow for more powerful devices— and could even potentially allow apple to
