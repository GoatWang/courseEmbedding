owners portfolio name prints here  name and title northwestern mutual series fund inc  def a    proposal proposal        approval of an amendment to a component of the investment objective of the balanced portfolio balanced portfolio which portfolios shareholders will vote on this proposal proposal  applies to shareholders of the balanced portfolio as of the record date what are shareholders being asked to approve shareholders of the balanced portfolio are being asked to approve a change to a component of the portfolios fundamental investment objective the balanced portfolios current investment objective has two components primary and supplemental the primary component is to realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent investment risk the primary objective the primary objective remains unchanged the second component supplements the primary objective by utilizing the investment objectives and policies for the index  portfolio select bond portfolio and money market portfolio the supplemental objective shareholders are being asked to approve the removal of the supplemental objective as an investment objective of the balanced portfolio what are the reasons for the proposed change the balanced portfolio invests in the stock bond and money market sectors in the manner as described for the index  portfolio the select bond portfolio and the money market portfolio respectively the index  portfolios investment objective is to seek investment results that approximate the performance of the standard  poors ® composite stock price index the sp ® index the sp ® index is an unmanaged index of  selected common stocks and is comprised primarily of large capitalization companies that represent a broad spectrum of the us economy and a substantial part of the us stock markets total capitalization using a computer program the index  portfolio and therefore the equity portion of the balanced portfolio invests in stocks included in the sp ® index in proportion to their weighting in the sp ® index in order to track the performance of the sp ® index the supplemental objective therefore limits diversification of the equity component of the balanced portfolio to investments in those large capitalization companies that comprise the sp ® index msa believes and the board of directors concurs that in order to provide msa with more flexibility to achieve the balanced portfolios primary objective the portfolio should have the ability to further diversify its holdings by investing in companies with small and midsized market capitalizations and foreign companies  in addition to large capitalization companies such as those that comprise the sp ® index when and to the extent msa as investment advisor for the portfolio deems appropriate msa believes that by broadening the investment mandate among a greater number of asset classes msa can reduce the portfolios volatility and overall risk and potentially improve returns if the proposal is approved therefore the balanced portfolio would no longer be required to invest the equity component of its assets only in securities of large capitalization companies that comprise the sp ® index and would have the flexibility to invest in securities of small mid andor large capitalization companies and foreign companies the investment strategy of the balanced fund would also be modified to reflect this increased flexibility with respect to the components of the supplemental objective that reference the objective of the select bond portfolio and money market portfolio msa has recommended and the board of directors has concurred that these references are not necessary and their removal would avoid confusion as to the objective of the balanced portfolio the primary objective of the balanced portfolio and the primary investment objective of the select bond portfolio are identical ie to realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent investment risk msa as investment advisor to the balanced portfolio in seeking to achieve the balanced portfolios primary objective would continue to invest its fixed income component subject to the same investment policies currently applicable to the select bond and money market portfolios the select bond portfolio normally invests at least  of its net assets in a diversified portfolio of investment grade debt securities and may invest up to  of net assets in noninvestment grade high yieldhigh risk bonds also known as junk bonds it may also invest up to  of its net assets in foreign bonds these investment policies will continue to apply for the fixed income component of the balanced portfolio while historically the balanced portfolio has not purchased assets in the high yieldhigh risk bonds even though it had the authority to do so msa anticipates that it will begin to purchase high yieldhigh risk bonds for the balanced portfolio as is consistent with the balanced portfolios primary objective and being subject to the existing limit on investments in these types of securities msa believes that by diversifying the balanced portfolio among investment grade and noninvestment grade bonds along with investing in multiple equity classes it may better achieve its primary objective by potentially i reducing the portfolios volatility and ii improving returns the investment objective of the money market portfolio is to realize maximum current income to the extent consistent with liquidity and stability of capital it invests only in highquality short term money market instruments that present minimal credit risks as determined by msa msa intends to continue to manage the money market component of the balanced portfolio with this same goal and subject to similar investment policies  the chart below provides the changes that would be made to the balanced portfolios investment objective and investment policies if this proposal is approved by shareholders if the proposal is not approved the supplemental objective of the balanced portfolio will remain the same and the board of directors may consider other courses of action     current balanced portfolio   proposed changes to balanced       portfolio       investment objective to realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent investment risk the balanced portfolios investment objective is supplemented by investment objectives and policies for the stock bond and money market sectors these are presently substantially identical to those which have been established for the index  stock select bond and money market portfolios to realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent investment risk through income and capital appreciation      current balanced portfolio   proposed changes to balanced       portfolio       investment strategy investing in the stock bond and money market sectors as described for the index  stock select bond and money market portfolios management attempts to capitalize on the variation in return potential produced by the interaction of changing financial markets and economic conditions while maintaining a balance over time between investment opportunities and their associated potential risks by following a flexible policy of allocating assets across the three market sectors management may adjust the percentage of assets in each market sector in response to changing market and economic conditions the portfolio normally has some portion of its assets in all three asset categories however up to  may be invested in money market instruments and not more than  may be invested in either the stock or bond sector investing in the stock bond and money market sectors management attempts to capitalize on the variation in return potential produced by the interaction of changing financial markets and economic conditions while maintaining a balance over time between investment opportunities and their associated potential risks by following a flexible policy of allocating assets across the three market sectors the portfolio is actively managed to attempt to capitalize on changing financial markets and economic conditions following a flexible policy for allocating assets according to a benchmark of  equities  debt and  in money market instruments however these benchmarks are not minimum and maximum limits and msa may invest a greater or lesser percentage in any component               the equity component is invested in a manner designed to track the performance of the sp ® index which is comprised primarily of large capitalization companies equity investments will  be actively managed and may consist of small mid and large capitalization companies and foreign stocks based on msas economic and market outlook and its perceived opportunities in each class up to  of net assets may be invested in foreign stocks    debt securities will generally consist primarily of investment grade debt securities with maturities exceeding one year though the portfolio may invest up to  of the portfolios total net assets in noninvestment grade high yieldhigh risk bonds money market instruments will consist of highquality short term money market instruments that present minimal credit risks as determined by msa   up to  of the portfolios net assets may be invested in foreign bonds debt securities will generally consist of investment grade debt securities with maturities exceeding one year though the portfolio may invest up to  of the portfolios total net assets in noninvestment grade high yieldhigh risk bonds money market instruments will consist of highquality short term money market instruments that present minimal credit risks as determined by msa   up to  of the portfolios net assets may be invested in foreign bonds what are the risks to the balanced portfolio of investing in securities of small and midsized companies foreign companies and high yieldhigh risk bonds small and midsized companies may involve greater risk of loss and price fluctuation the trading markets for securities of small and midsized companies may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of larger companies this means that the portfolio could have greater difficulty buying or selling a security of a small or midsized company at an acceptable price especially in periods of market volatility in addition small and midsized companies can have more limited product lines markets and financial resources than larger more wellestablished companies foreign securities can involve additional risks relating to political economic or regulatory conditions in foreign countries these risks include fluctuations in foreign currencies withholding or other taxes and trading settlement custodial and other operational risks foreign securities may also be subject to the less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards of some foreign markets all of these factors can make foreign investments more volatile and potentially less liquid than us investments in addition foreign markets can perform differently from the us market  noninvestment grade high yieldhigh risk bonds sometimes referred to as junk bonds tend to offer higher yields than higherrated securities of comparable maturities however they usually present greater risk of loss of income and principal they are directly affected by the market perception of the creditworthiness of the securities issuers and are more likely to react to developments affecting market and credit risk than higher rated securities the yield and price therefore may experience greater volatility than is the case with higher rated securities in addition the secondary market for these securities which is concentrated in relatively few market makers may not be as liquid and under adverse market conditions the secondary market could contract further judgment plays a more significant role in valuing these securities than those securities for which more objective market data are available will there be any change in the balanced portfolios management fee or other operating expenses if the proposal is approved by shareholders the management fee paid to msa by the balanced portfolio will remain the same msa does not expect any change to the balanced portfolios other operating expenses as a result of the change except that with more asset classes available the ability to invest in foreign stocks and the intention to invest more in high yieldhigh risk securities portfolio turnover may be greater larger portfolio turnover rates result in more transaction costs which are paid out of the assets of the balanced portfolio and like other portfolio expenses can reduce returns in addition upon the implementation of the changes if approved by shareholders there will be an initial increase in these transaction costs as some assets are moved from large capitalization companies to smaller companies and foreign securities when will the proposed change become effective if approved by shareholders at the special meeting the proposed amendment to the balanced portfolios fundamental investment objective will become effective on april   what vote is required to approve the proposal only shareholders of the balanced portfolio will vote on this proposal approval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the balanced portfolio as defined in the  act that
