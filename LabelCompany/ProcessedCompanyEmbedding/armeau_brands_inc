nature a miracle of nature because its intense sweetness comes from grapes grown plump under the hot armenian sun and then frozen in the snows of armenian winter this is one of the world’s rarest and most luxurious wines—rare because only a handful of vineyards provide the climate extremes required for icewine luxurious because the yield is so small and so precious that every drop is pure gold nextancient armenia armenia ancient winemaking culture legend says the original vitis vinifera the first grape vine was planted by noah on mount ararat and this frieze on a th century aghtamar church shows the long history of armenian wine and it is not a legend it is a fact that archaeologists unearthed the world’s oldest known winery dated from  bc in armenia’s vayots dzor province in a cave close to the armeau vineyards next the perfect vineyard the perfect vineyard in recent years canada has developed an international reputation for fine icewine but armenia provides even more favorable conditions for the nurturing of icewine grapes—hotter summers up to  degrees celsius and colder winters down to  degrees armeau oenologists searched throughout armenia to find the perfect location analyzing weather charts of the last twenty years they chose a vineyard  metres above sea level in the ancient winemaking province of vayots dzor nextunique grapes unique grapes ideal for icewine the nectar that becomes armeau icewine comes from voskehat and areni grapes unique to armenia golden voskehat from vineyards in the fragrant foothills of vayots dzor gives armeau white the honeysweet flavor of pear and hazelnut lush and elegant areni grown from centuriesold vines brings plum and cherry ripeness with a tantalizing hint of spice to armeau red next expertise and passion canadian expertise armenian passion directing the production of armeau icewines in collaboration with armenia’s leading vintners is tilman hainle a pioneering winemaker for more than three decades whose wines have received numerous gold medals in international judging working with his father hainle developed north america’s first icewine called by wine critic jurgen gothe “a hallmark against which the rest of the world’s icewines must take their measure” next challenge and triumph the challenge and the triumph the challenge to vintners of icewine is great cultivation is highly labor intensive the vagaries of weather are a constant risk to grape development so is the threat of predators these are vines that require constant security then after dedicated nurturing has brought the grapes to the precise perfect moment harvesting by hand must be completed in a few hours the  icewine harvest took place january  with the temperature at  celsius next nectar to icewine from nectarto wine pressing has to be done while the grapes are still frozen and the yield while precious is small a vine that would produce grapes for a bottle of wine yields only enough for a glass of icewine but out of this come wines full of luscious fruit flavor and refreshing sweetness enlivened by high acidity—the blissful marriage of summer sun and winter snow truly a miracle of nature—and the winemaker’s art next how to serve how toserve icewine icewine is best presented in small portions — a twoounce serving is suggested — in larger white wine stemware this brings forth its bouquet it should be chilled but not overly cold  to  degrees celsius is recommended allowing the wine’s fruit to become more expressive although icewine may be enjoyed at any time it is traditionally served at the conclusion of meals it is the perfect ending with any dessert or by itself it is a one writer put it “a dessert in a glass” next armeau brands aboutarmeau brands armeau icewines are produced and distributed by

otherwise indicated   corporate overview   our company was incorporated in the state of nevada on march   our business objectives are to produce and market our own brand of ice wine made from grapes harvested in armenia a ice wine to china and russia we seek to significantly expand the production of our icewine which we believe is the first ice wine produced in armenia or its neighboring regions   our offices are currently located at  lyon court toronto ontario canada mb h our telephone number is   we have a website at wwwarmeaubrandscom   activities to date   in the summer of  our company sought proposals from various icewine experts in canada with the objective of producing icewine in armenia   on august   we accepted an icewine consultation proposal from mr tilman hainle of imbibedesign mr hainle along with his father had produced the first icewine in canada in  pursuant to this proposal imbibedesign outlined the scope of work schedule deliverables and terms of agreement for the icewine design and production process in armenia fees due to imbibedesign under this proposal were approximately  which was initially estimated at  and comprised of billings at an hourly rate of hour   in september  mr hainle accompanied our company to armenia in armenia we contracted mr gagik melyan the deputy director of the scientific centre of viticulture for armenia fruitgrowing and winemaking to accompany our team to various grape growing regions in armenia and to provide us with his scientific and expert guidance and supervision of vineyard activities in armenia for the  season the scientific centre of viticulture for armenia was founded in  and is a research institute engaged in plant breeding since its inception and in plant biotechnology since  activities concern grapes and other fruits  of its budget is directed to germplasm enhancement the  remaining is equally shared between line development and line evaluation        table of contents   on october   we entered into a contractor agreement with mr melyan where we would compensate him  per month in exchange for his expertise with the help of our experts our company identified a village near the town of areni in the province of vayots dzor that had the right climatic and soil conditions for icewine production two indigenous armenian grapes one red and one white were chosen to create our first vintage   our company then began negotiations with various local wine companies in armenia on october   our company and edvag group entered into a wine services agreement the “wine services agreement” whereas edvag group agreed to provide winemaking services to produce a canadianstyle icewine under the tutelage of mr hainle   under this agreement edvag shall manage and realize the entire winemaking process under the guidance and direction of our company and our technical contractors   we will also reimburse edvag for the following items procured for or on behalf of armeau in the winemaking process at landed cost plus taxes this agreement will continue in force for a minimum period of  years edvag is a wholly managed winemaking company duly registered in armenia and operating in the cis and international markets   on october    m  hectares of vineyard was reserved in a village in the province of vayots dzor armenia to reserve the vineyard the vineyard owner was paid in advance on an estimated yield edvag paid this advance on our behalf and we paid edvag back with an extra  service fee as per our agreement on january   six tons of white voskehat and three tons of red areni were harvested at a temperature of °c °f   on february   we accepted a proposal by imbibedesign to travel to armenia again this time to oversee the fermentation of our icewine pursuant to this proposal imbibedesign outlined the scope of work schedule deliverables and terms of agreement for the icewine winemaking in armenia fees due to imbibedesign under this proposal were approximately  which included a lump sum of  and additional services such as change in the scope of work by us that was billed at an hourly billing rate of hour    litres of icewine were produced the icewine produced consisted of  litres of white icewine voskehat grape and  litres of red icewine areni grape the red icewine was ultimately judged of insufficient quality and rejected due to technical problems the bottling of the white icewine was delayed until december  when the wine was deemed ready to drink  bottles of white icewine were bottled and  bottles were sent to canada in december  for sampling and evaluation we are using the remaining  bottles for tasting and sampling by potential customers and distributors   on february   we entered into a distribution agreement with alpha food services pursuant to this agreement we agreed to grant to alpha food services for a term of three years the exclusive right to sell and distribute our icewine products in armenia russia and the commonwealth of independent states the agreement does not apply to our first vintage which is being used for sample and marketing purposes   the purchase price of icewine to alpha food includes delivery to alpha food’s warehouse the delivery cost component of the purchase price shall be mutually negotiated and adjusted between the parties from time to time in response to account for any changes to the delivery requirements our company and alpha food shall negotiate any price increases for any icewine products at least  days prior to the effective date of any such increase alpha food shall have the right to order one month of supply of the icewine products at the current price prior to any increase   our company and alpha food shall agree on our price to alpha food and alpha food’s price to its customers all parties shall agree on an annual basis or more frequently if required as to the prices at which alpha food shall sell the icewine products to its customers   in the event that our company and alpha food cannot agree on either price within  days of commencement of the negotiations the prices then in effect for each of said prices will be increased by an amount equal to the change in the consumer price indexall us over a period of months equal to the number of months since the last price increase for each price this agreement shall continue in full force and effect for a period of three years        table of contents   our recent business   during fiscal  we were unable to raise the necessary funds to achieve our objectives of buying and equipping a winemaking facility in armeia we did not earn any revenues from march   date of inception to january   however we did produce  bottles of icewine which will be used for product sampling and marketing to potential customers and distributors we intend to apply any proceeds from the sale of our current icewine reserves toward the production of a second vintage we have not commenced the marketing stage of our business other than the review of data and online research the development of a logo and label selection of a bottle miniproduct brochure and the development of a website wwwarmeaubrandscom and can provide no assurance that we will generate revenue from the proposed sale of our beverages   competition and market position   canada is the world’s largest manufacturer of icewine and makes much more than all the other countries put together in  canada produced  million bottles worth on average approximately  million retail people relate to canada as a top icewine producer due to the wellknown cold canadian winters canada’s top international awards are dominated by icewine   while germany and austria also makes icewine their winters are not cold enough to consistently produce icewine every year   counterfeit icewines made by cryoextraction the process by which grapes are frozen with refrigeration and pressed have become prominent items in retail stores across asia bearing false labels these “freezer wines” lack the intensity and complexity of authentic icewines freezerfrozen grapes will usually not have hung on the vines as long undergoing the physical and chemical changes that give authentic icewines their unique aromas and flavors even more of a problem are artificially sweetened icewines some estimate that as much as  of icewines sold in china are fake   icewine has proven particularly popular in asia pacific and southeast asian markets in recent years as the fascination with icewine’s unique production ie handpicked frozen grapes during winter months is widespread among these regions’ consumers in fact icewine is a “sought afterexclusive” product and is often purchased when visiting canada as gifts or investments the growth of canadian icewine in asian markets is realized firsthand in export data approximately  of canadian icewine is exported to asian markets furthermore seven of the top ten canadian icewine export destinations are asian countries signifying the popularity of the dessert wine in this region   in  the canadian vintners association “ cva ” stated that icewine export value was  million and volume  litres furthermore the cva stated that china is the number one export market for canada with over  million of icewine  l exported in  the top  icewine export markets in  were china south korea singapore hong kong taiwan japan united states united kingdom malaysia and france representing  of icewine export sales volume    chinese consumers are attracted to the taste profile of the concentrated rich icewine they are impressed with the international awards and the prestige that accompanies icewine and they have a much stronger gifting culture   rising incomes especially in urban areas have led to greater demand for high quality prestige products that can demonstrate wealth and convey status in urban areas there is also greater receptiveness to new types of alcoholic beverages niche products and imported drinks like icewine   russia being a trade partner to armenia is also a major potential market for our company canadian icewine has not yet made inroads in russia however sweet wines do dominate this market russians like the chinese generally have a sweeter taste preference for wines than in the western world also the taste for premium and prestigious material possession and status remain important to russians we believe icewine has the potential to capture these trends        table of contents    suppliers   we signed a formal longterm agreement with edvag group to produce our icewine in armenia the contract is based on an à la carte pricing menu whereas we can purchase services as needed our intellectual property rights which include our trade secrets in icewine making are protected in the agreement   distribution methods   our winemaker edvag group provides warehousing and distribution services from their location in yerevan armenia they will bill us on a monthly basis for these services   intellectual property   previously we were granted an armenian trademark registration for “armeau” in  we started the process of a us trademark unfortunately after spending a considerable amount of money on legal services the trademark registration lapsed due to our inability to demonstrate use of the trademark which is a requirement in registering a trademark because of our delays in production of our icewine once we have the funds and are in a position to register our trademark we will begin the process again   government regulations   our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations in areas such as food and beverage alcohol consumer protection government contracts trade environmental protection labor and employment tax licensing and others for example in the canada and us most federal and local governments have alcohol laws and regulations directed specifically toward our industry including even environmental laws in certain jurisdictions we will have to obtain licenses or permits in order to comply with standards governing environmental regulations and the sale of alcoholic beverages   the alcoholic beverage industry is also subject to requirements codes and standards imposed by various insurance approval and listing and standards organizations depending upon the type of alcoholic beverage and requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction adherence to the requirements codes and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others   we do not believe that compliance with government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business given the alcohol related content that will be available on our website we will implement appropriate safeguards and electronic warnings to ensure that visitors to our site are aware of any age related restrictions that may be applicable to them while visiting our site and are abiding by applicable laws regarding alcohol such as age verification and ensure that all applicable duties and taxes are paid furthermore our distributors will be contractors who are experienced in alcoholic beverage distribution and product sold over the internet can be verified by either credit card information and limited by internet proxy information   the effects of material regulations on wine businesses are      limitations of sales to specific jurisdictionsgeographic areas          limitation of sales to specific consumers          compliance of food and beverage qualitative standards and measures          increased cost due to compliance with duties permitting and regulation and          compliance and limitation of means of marketing sales and advertising of products        table of contents    employees and employment agreements   we have no employees other than our sole director and officer management and office administration services are provided by cassandra tavukciyan we do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next  month period we do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed   we intend to engage contractors from time to time to consult with us on specific corporate affairs or to perform specific tasks in connection with our business objectives    research and development   we have not spent any amounts on that which has been classified as research and development activities in our financial statements during the last two fiscal years   reports to security holders   we are required to file annual quarterly and current reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission and our filings are available to the public over the internet at the securities and exchange commission’s website at httpwwwsecgov the public may read and copy any materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission at the securities and exchange commission’s public reference room at  f street ne washington dc  the public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the securities and exchange commission at  the sec also maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec at httpwwwsecgov   item a risk factors   risks related to our business   we have a formal longterm agreement with a winemaker in armenia but it can be terminated on a day notice   currently we have a formal agreement with a winemaker in armenia to produce icewine if we cannot continue to secure an agreement our current business will be severely impaired there can be no assurance that the agreement can continue indefinitely on terms that management deems sufficiently favorable if we are unable to obtain a new agreement for icewine production upon terms that management deems sufficiently favorable or at all it would have a material adverse impact upon our ability to conduct our business operations further we have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers in armenia protecting our icewinemaking knowledge and a noncompete clause that extends even after the termination of the agreements however we cannot assure that it can indefinitely protect that competitive knowledge   we require capital in order to take the necessary steps to grow our business   currently we do not have available funds to produce a new icewine vintage or fund other operating and general and administrative expenses necessary to grow our business further we do not have the funds available to hire independent contractors if we cannot secure additional financing our growth and operations could be impaired by limitations on our access to capital there can be no assurance that capital from outside sources will be available or if such financing is available that it will be on terms that management deems sufficiently favorable if we are unable to obtain additional financing upon terms that management deems sufficiently favorable or at all it would have a material adverse impact upon our ability to conduct our business operations and pursue our expansion strategy as of the date of this filing we have minimal operations and did not generate any revenues during the year ended january   in the event we do not raise additional capital from conventional sources it is likely that we may need to scale back or curtail implementing our business plan which could cause any securities in our company to be worthless        table of contents   we have generated no revenues and have a limited operation to date   we generated no revenues since our inception on march   and currently have minimal operations furthermore we anticipate our expenses increasing in the future especially when we commence production of our next vintage of ice wines we can make no assurances that we will be able to generate any revenues in the future that we will have sufficient funding to support our operations and pay our expenses andor that we will be able to gain customers in the future to build our business operations in the event we are unable to generate revenues andor support our operations we will be forced to curtail andor abandon our current business plan and any investment in our company could become worthless   we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability   although we intend to sell our products in us dollars pursuant to our distribution agreement with alpha food services we have and may be required in the future to conduct transactions in foreign currencies but report in us dollars as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies our predominant exposures are to the canadian dollar armenian dram russian ruble and the chinese renminbi “ rmb ” with respect to the effects on earnings if the us currency strengthens relative to other currencies our earnings could be negatively impacted the translation impact may be more material in the future we have not utilized risk management tools such as hedging   we acquire many products from our suppliers that are manufactured in armenia to the extent the dram or other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar we may experience cost increases on such purchases we may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted   our business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing in armenia   our future operations could be adversely affected by various factors including changes in armenia’s political or economic conditions the political system of armenia is currently stable with four political parties populating its emerging democratic landscape armenia has a functioning market economy   armenia has joined numerous international organizations including the united nations world trade organization the council of europe la francophonie and many others it is also part of the postsoviet trade agreement the eurasian union with russia kazakhstan and belarus   armenia is currently blockaded on two of its four borders by azerbaijan and turkey this situation is a result of a territorial dispute between armenia and azerbaijan leading to the nagornokarabakh war – although russia france and the united states are currently attempting to broker an end to this crisis we believe that this dispute may continue we believe that this blockade has severely hurt the armenian economy if war restarts our exports may be interrupted indefinitely if we cannot export our product we will be unable to implement our business plan   externally the availability of only two export routes out of armenia means the closing of borders or other trade restrictions imposed by armenia’s neighbors are an operational risk although landlocked armenia maintains positive relations with iran and georgia through which many of its exports travel   icewine production is subject to many risks   natural icewines require a minimum hard freeze  °c  °f or colder to occur sometime after the grapes are ripe which means that the grapes may hang on the vine for several months following the normal harvest if a freeze does not come quickly enough the grapes may rot  botrytis cinerea  or noble rot and the crop will be lost if the freeze is too severe no juice can be extracted the longer the harvest is delayed the more fruit will be lost to wild animals and dropped fruit theft is another concern in a poor country so the vineyard has to be constantly monitored and maintained since the fruit must be pressed while it is still frozen pickers often must work at night or very early in the morning harvesting the grapes within a few hours   also the juice is very sweet and can be difficult to ferment high sugars can create a hostile environment for the yeast and fermentation stops early leaving relatively low alcohol and high sugar levels in the finished wine        table of contents   we need to find distributors in china and russia for the longterm success of our product   china is the biggest potential market for our product followed by russia if we are unable to conclude an agreement with distributors in those countries we will be unable to implement our business plan   our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast our future results making any investment in our company highly speculative   we have a limited operating history and our historical financial and operating information is of limited value in predicting our future operating results we may not accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends changing preferences or competitive factors facing us and therefore we may fail to make accurate financial forecasts our current and future expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenue as a result we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall which could then force us to curtail or cease our business operations   our losses raise substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as a going concern   we have not generated any revenues since our inception have a working capital deficit of  as at january   and have had cumulative operating losses from our inception to the year ended january   of  these factors among others indicate that we may be unable to continue as a going concern particularly in the event that we cannot generate future revenues obtain additional financing andor attain profitable operations as such our independent auditors have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in their audited financial statements attached hereto the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we cannot continue as a going concern your investment in us could become devalued or worthless   we will sell and market a branded product which is an important asset violation of trademark rights by counterfeiters and imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation   unauthorized use of our products’ trademark rights may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent us to our customers contractors suppliers and increase litigation costs presently it is estimated that  of icewines in china are fake   our industry is competitive   the icewine industry is highly competitive and fragmented canada is the world leader in the production of icewine germany and austria also have similar products we will compete in its potential markets with numerous canadian companies many of which have substantially greater financial managerial and other resources than those presently available to us numerous wellestablished companies are focusing significant resources on icewine that currently compete and will compete with our products in the future in addition we expect other copycat products to appear from armenian competitors now that armeau brands successfully produced the first icewine in armenia we can make no assurance that it will be able to effectively compete with these other companies or that competitive pressures including possible downward pressure on the prices we charge for our products will not arise in the event that we cannot effectively compete on a continuing basis or competitive pressures arise such inability to compete or competitive pressures will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   our growth will place significant strains on our resources   since inception on march   we had little to no operations we are currently in the development stage with no operations and have not generated any revenues since inception our growth if any is expected to place a significant strain on our managerial operational and financial resources as we currently have only one employee and will likely continue to have limited employees in the future furthermore assuming we release our products and establish a customer base it will be required to manage multiple relationships with various distributors and other third parties these requirements will be exacerbated in the event of further growth of our company or in the number of its distribution contracts there can be no assurance that our systems procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that we will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully offer its services and implement its business plan our future operating results if any will also depend on its ability to add additional personnel commensurate with the growth of its business if any if we are unable to manage growth effectively our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected        table of contents   our bylaws limit the liability of and provide indemnification for our officers and directors   our bylaws provide that every person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action suit or proceeding whether civil criminal administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he or a

corporation law of the state of nevada from time to time against all expenses liability and loss including attorneys’ fees judgments fines and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement reasonably incurred or suffered by him in connection therewith thus our company may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions by the officers and directors for liabilities incurred in connection with their good faith acts for our company such an indemnification payment might deplete our assets stockholders who have questions respecting the fiduciary obligations of the officers and directors of our company should consult with independent legal counsel it is the position of the securities and exchange commission that exculpation from and indemnification for liabilities arising under the  act and the rules and regulations thereunder is against public policy and therefore unenforceable   risks related to management stockholder control and regulatory compliance   the success of our company depends heavily on cassandra tavukciyan and her contacts   the success of our company will depend on the abilities of cassandra tavukciyan the president and chief executive officer of our company to generate business from her existing contacts and relationships within the alcoholic beverage industry in armenia the loss of ms tavukciyan will have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations if any and financial condition of our company in addition the loss of ms tavukciyan may force our company to seek a replacement who may have less experience fewer contacts or less understanding of our business further we can make no assurances that we will be able to find a suitable replacement for ms tavukciyan which could force our company to curtail its operations andor cause any investment in our company to become worthless our company does not have an employment agreement with ms tavukciyan nor any key person insurance on ms tavukciyan    our ceo and director has other interests outside of our company and may not be able to devote sufficient time to our operations   cassandra tavukciyan our sole officer and director of our company currently has interests outside of our company ms tavukciyan is currently our only executive officer and spends approximately  hours per week on matters relating to our company   risks
