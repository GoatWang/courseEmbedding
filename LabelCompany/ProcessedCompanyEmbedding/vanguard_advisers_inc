clients with assets of  or more get their own dedicated advisor where vanguard personal advisor services shines low management fee is a  management fee low in the grand scheme of roboadvisors not really wealthfront charges a flat  on balances over  and manages the portion under  free other services like schwab intelligent portfolios and wisebanyan are free of management costs altogether — though as with all roboadvisors the investments carry expense ratios paid by the investor but it may be more reasonable to compare vanguard’s fees with similar hybrid services like betterment and personal capital vanguard comes in lower there betterment charges  for its service that is most similar to vanguard offering unlimited access to a team of financial advisors personal capital charges  for accounts up to  million compared with that — and the  or greater fee typically charged by a financial advisor — vanguard’s management fee is reasonable however personal capital clients get access to one or two dedicated financial advisors depending on their account balance vanguard provides a dedicated advisor only to clients with  or more under that amount clients have access to a team of over  advisors but won’t work with the same one regularly investments vanguard personal advisor services builds portfolios on a clientbyclient basis using primarily vanguard funds in many ways that benefits investors vanguard funds carry some of the lowest expense ratios available and many competitor roboadvisors also use them as the base of their portfolios however it allows vanguard to line its pockets twice once with the management fee and again with fund expense ratios which range from  to  unlike other roboadvisors vanguard’s service doesn’t exclusively use exchange traded funds portfolios are primarily constructed of index funds and in some cases actively managed funds vanguard says its advisors will incorporate etfs if the client wants to use them and clients also can include a money market fund for access to liquidity core portfolio holdings include admiral shares of vanguard’s total stock market index fund total bond market index fund international stock market index fund international bond market index fund and limited intermediate and longterm taxexempt funds which invest in municipal bonds comprehensive management vanguard personal advisor services directly manages brokerage and individual retirement accounts as well as trusts but the advisors will also take into account other aspects of a client’s portfolio like a k college savings plans or even accounts held at another firm when developing a financial plan it’s up to you to tell your advisor about those assets and they won’t be managed directly by vanguard advisors but the advice you get will be comprehensive and fitting of your full financial picture financial advisors part of the value in hiring a financial advisor is that you have someone to turn to when life gets stormy whether that means the markets have taken a dive or you’re experiencing personal turbulence an advisor will help you adjust your plan if needed or remind you that your plan is sound and you just need to ride out the waves likewise an advisor can help you plan for and adjust to major milestones like a marriage or the birth of a child vanguard personal advisor services does that too though it does it best for clients with  or more only at that asset level do you get a dedicated advisor something we found the company’s website fails to make clear at lower account balances you’ll work with vanguard’s band of advisors rather than one person assigned to your account the advisors will help you adjust your investments as needed and send you quarterly progress reports you can schedule time to speak to an advisor via phone or video conferencing and advisors are also available for quick questions via email where vanguard personal advisor services falls short account minimum there’s no way around this  is a high account minimum it’s clear vanguard is limiting its service to balances that given the low management fee will make a significant impact on its bottom line the minimum puts the service out of reach for many new investors though that minimum can be spread among multiple accounts the company adds another layer with the  minimum to access a dedicated financial advisor possible transaction fees many roboadvisors swallow the cost of any transaction fees incurred in client accounts such as trade commissions and mutual fund load or sales charges expense ratios typically are passed on to the investor these fees are generally minimal in roboadvisor accounts which primarily use etfs and index funds but vanguard’s service does use other investments in some cases and the advisor’s service brochure notes that the client is subject to any transaction fees brokerage charges sales charges commissions or other fees and expenses that stem from the purchase of nonvanguard investments the company notes that it typically recommends noload mutual funds and vanguard funds taxloss harvesting the service is available here but it isn’t automatic rather taxloss harvest opportunities are approached on a clientbyclient basis which the company says is by design vanguard’s investment research shows that while taxloss harvesting can be beneficial it also carries risk clients who want daily monitoring for taxloss harvesting opportunities may not be happy with this approach vanguard does allocate assets across account types optimizing for taxes for example taxefficient investments will be placed in taxable accounts and those that generate a tax burden will go into taxsheltered retirement accounts when the client has both types of account this is similar to betterment’s taxcoordinated portfolio is vanguard personal advisor services right for you compared with roboadvisors vanguard personal advisor services is on the pricey side with a high account minimum but this service is more than a roboadvisor offering personalized financial planning and financial advisors to clients it’s an excellent choice for investors who can meet the account minimum and want to use the computer algorithms of a roboadvisor while maintaining access to a human touch if you have the  balance required to get your own dedicated financial advisor you’ll be able to

perspectives more news how to choose an actively managed mutual fund uk economic outlook brexit looms large brokerage trades will soon settle in just  days down from  vacations barbeques lazy summer days—and giving to charity research our firm with finras brokercheck reference content layer openedread the transcript liz tammaro so we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast were going to get started with our first question and jim im going to give this one to you so it makes a lot of sense before we get started lets define what is an etf jim rowley simply put an etf is an exchangetraded fund right− its a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund the fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand furthermore and i should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors whether its an index in particular or a market strategy and when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of etfs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the investment company act of  and thats the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate so for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and etfs theyre overwhelmingly similar actually liz tammaro and even thinking about that we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an etf or sorry even vice versa etf versus mutual fund and even maybe what are some of the disadvantages jim rowley ill take that because i think i dont necessarily like the word disadvantage i think differences is maybe the more appropriate term and we just addressed some of the similarities between etfs and mutual funds so its maybe more important to know what are the actual differences and really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds right− were talking about exchangetraded funds etf investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities and the price that they get is a tradeable market price mutual fund investors on the other hand they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but its back and forth with the fund itself and they get an endofday nav so we think about all the similarities and again sometimes theres a discussion about how different they are but really the differences come down to those two items its trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and its trading at a market price rather than getting the endofday nav jim rowley i think we actually have a great way to illustrate that i think we have a chart that addresses that point that doug was talking about that etfs are overwhelming they just happen to be index funds and when the chart comes up a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios but instead of breaking them down by etf versus mutual fund we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into etf and mutual fund and when you see the expense ratios you see that given an indexing strategy whether its a mutual fund or an etf the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies whether its an etf or a mutual fund so it has a lot more to do with whether or not its an indexing strategy than whether or not its an etf or a mutual fund liz tammaro and similar to that question we have another one thats come in from bruce asking about how easy is it to buy andor sell an etf versus a mutual fund− jim rowley a lot of moving parts in that question because i think the default has always been mutual funds because theyve been around longer so it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars you put your orders in in dollar terms youre happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a  pm nav you might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you with an etf investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account and now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares mutually speaking theres no fractionals there when you put your order in shares you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount so you know the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing important information all investing is subject to risk including the possible loss of the money you invest diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss for more information about vanguard funds or vanguard etfs visit vanguardcom or call  to obtain a prospectus investment objectives risks charges expenses or other important information are contained in the prospectus read and consider it carefully before investing vanguard etf shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars instead investors must buy and sell vanguard etf shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account in doing so the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling this webcast is for educational purposes only we recommend
