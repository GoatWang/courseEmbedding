trustee and the sponsor with respect to the offering of the shares and fund management and the shareholders are governed by the provisions of the dsta and by the trust agreement on january   the initial form s for the fund was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission sec on january    creation baskets for the fund were issued representing  shares and  the fund began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse arca on february   the fund is designed and managed to track the performance of a portfolio the benchmark portfolio consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on   and year us treasury securities treasury instruments weighted to achieve a targeted negative  year average effective portfolio duration the benchmark component instruments    the investment objective of the fund the funds investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of the benchmark portfolio consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on   and year us treasury securities weighted to achieve a targeted negative  year average effective portfolio duration the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio the benchmark portfolio is maintained by sit fixed income advisors ii llc sit and will be rebalanced reconstituted or both monthly typically on the th of each month and on the next business day if the th is a holiday weekend or other day on which the national exchanges are closed to maintain a negative  year average effective duration the benchmark portfolio and the fund will each maintain a short position in treasury instruments the fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio as of march   include name ticker market value usd us yr futr optn mayc fvkc  us yr note cbt jun fvm   us  yr note cbt jun tum   us yr fut optn mayp tykp  the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio and anticipated rebalancing dates as well as the daily holdings of the fund are available on the funds website at wwwrisingrateetfcom the weighting of the treasury instruments constituting the benchmark component instruments will be based on each maturitys duration contribution the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year and  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the relative weightings of the benchmark component instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve for example if the federal reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates in such an instance sit which maintains the benchmark portfolio will increase the weightings of the  year and reduce the weighting in the  year maturity treasury instruments conversely sit will do the opposite if the federal reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly on the th except for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative year average effective duration in which case sit will adjust the maturities of the treasury instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution the sponsor anticipates that approximately  to  of the funds assets will be used as payment for or collateral for treasury instruments in order to collateralize its treasury instrument positions the fund will hold such assets from which it will post margin to its fcm in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange and transfer to its fcm any additional amounts that may be separately required by the fcm when establishing positions in treasury instruments the fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each treasury instrument position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the fcm on a daily basis the fund will be obligated to pay or entitled to receive variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its treasury instruments positions any assets not required to be posted as margin with the fcm will be held at the funds administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below    the benchmark portfolio will be invested in benchmark component instruments and rebalanced as noted above to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately  years duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates for example if interest rates rise by  the market value of a security with an effective duration of  years would decrease by  with all other factors being constant and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative  years would increase by  with all other factors being constant duration estimates are based on assumptions by sit and are subject to a number of limitations duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in shortterm and longterm securities investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise the risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities the fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations the fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as us treasuries or other high credit quality shortterm fixedincome or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the treasury instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis these expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the funds nav and changes in the benchmark portfolio because the benchmark portfolio does not reflect expenses or income the sponsor etf managers capital llc is the sponsor of the trust and the fund the sponsor is a delaware limited liability company formed on june   the principal office is located at  beechwood road suite b summit nj  the sponsor is registered as a commodity pool operator cpo with the commodity futures trading commission

difference is related to the cumulative impact on nav of the funds expenses for the period from february   to march   fund share price performance during the period from february   commencement of shares trading on the nyse arca to march   the nyse arca market value of each share decreased  from  per share representing the initial trade on february   to  per share representing the closing price

during the period from february   to march   net loss for the period from february   to march   was  resulting from net realized losses on futures and options contracts of  net unrealized losses on futures and options contracts of  and the net operating loss of  calculating nav the funds nav is calculated by � taking the current market value of its total assets    the administrator calculates the nav of the fund once each nyse arca trading day the nav for a particular trading day is released after  pm new york time trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at  pm new york time the administrator uses the cme closing price determined at the earlier of the close of the cme for the contracts traded on the cme but calculates or determines the value of all other fund investments using market quotations if available or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or  pm new york time in accordance with the current administrative agency agreement among us bancorp fund services the fund and the sponsor other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including without limitation relevant rates prices yields yield curves volatilities spreads correlations or other market data in the relevant market or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by the fund in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions the information may include costs of funding to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized third parties supplying quotations or market data may include without limitation dealers in the relevant markets endusers of the relevant product information vendors brokers and other sources of market information in addition in order to provide updated information relating to the fund for use by investors and market professionals the nyse arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value the indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior days closing nav per share of the fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and options held by the fund traded on the cme the indicative fund value share basis disseminated during nyse arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the nav because the nav is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the funds investments the indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every  seconds during regular nyse arca core trading session hours of  am new york time to  pm new york time the normal trading hours of the cme are  am new york time to  pm new york time this means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which the funds shares are traded on the nyse arca but realtime cme trading prices for contracts traded on the cme are not available during such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the cmes immediately preceding trading session in addition other investments and us treasuries held by the fund will be valued by the administrator using rates and points received from clientapproved third party vendors such as reuters and wm company and advisor quotes these investments will not be included in the indicative fund value the nyse arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of ctacq high speed lines in addition the indicative fund value is published on the nyse arcas website and is available through online information services such as bloomberg and reuters dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the fund shares on the nyse arca investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the fund and the indicative fund value if the market price of the fund shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades for example if the fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value a market professional could buy the fund shares on the nyse arca and take the opposite position in treasury instruments such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants critical accounting policies the funds critical accounting policies are as follows preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates the funds application of these policies involves judgments and the use of estimates actual results may differ from the estimates used and such differences could be material the fund holds a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts and a money market fund which are held at fair value the fund calculates its net asset value as of the nav calculation time as described above    the values which are used by the fund for its treasury instruments are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available in addition the fund estimates interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents these estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference if any is not considered material credit risk when the fund enters into benchmark component instruments it will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations for purposes of credit risk the counterparty for the benchmark component instruments traded on the cme and other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges in general clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members which should significantly reduce credit risk there can be no assurance that any counterparty clearinghouse or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to the fund the sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally � executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties as determined by the sponsor � limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the fund � not posting margin directly with a counterparty � limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the fcm and � ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for the commodity exchange act cea requires all fcms such as the funds clearing broker to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the cftc the cftc has similar authority over introducing brokers or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades the cea authorizes the cftc to regulate trading by fcms and by their officers and directors permits the cftc to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the cea the cea also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the cftc on november   the cftc published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for fcms the rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the fcms with which they may choose to do business fcms are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner the capital and liquidity of fcms are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the cftc and the selfregulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of fcms in a thorough manner liquidity and capital resources the fund does not anticipate making use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations the fund meets its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the cash cash equivalents andor the collateralizing treasury securities that it holds the funds liquidity needs include redeeming its shares providing margin deposits for existing benchmark component instruments the purchase of additional benchmark component instruments and paying expenses the fund generates cash primarily from i the sale of creation baskets and ii interest earned on cash cash equivalents and their investments in collateralizing treasury securities generally all of the net assets of the fund are allocated to trading in benchmark component instruments most of the assets of the fund are held in treasury instruments cash andor cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral for trading in benchmark component instruments the percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the benchmark component instruments change interest earned on interestbearing assets of the fund is paid to the fund    the investments of the fund in benchmark component instruments could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions regulatory considerations and other reasons such conditions could prevent the fund from promptly liquidating a position in benchmark component instruments market risk trading in benchmark component instruments such as futures contracts will involve the fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of instruments at a specified date in the future the gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements of the fund as the fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date as a result the funds market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts not from the need to make delivery under the contracts the fund considers the fair value of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts the market risk associated with the commitment by the fund to purchase a specific contract will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contracts held the exposure of the fund to market risk will depend on a number of factors including the markets for the specific instrument the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates the liquidity of the instrumentspecific market and the relationships among the contracts held by the fund regulatory environment the regulation of futures markets futures contracts and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive the cftc and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits increased margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading the regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the united states altering perhaps to a material extent the nature of an investment in the fund or the ability of the fund to continue to implement its investment strategy the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse the cftc possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of commodity pool operators and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons andor entities under the cea a registered cpo such as the sponsor is required to make annual filings with the cftc describing its organization capital structure management and controlling persons in addition the cea authorizes the cftc to require and review books and

futures contracts and options on futures contracts on us treasuries when the fund purchases a futures contract the fund is required to deposit with the selling fcm on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation at maturity this deposit is known as initial margin the fund will receive or pay depending on market movement variation margin as the value of the futures position increase or decreases the fund will pay premiums on the options contracts that it purchases the sponsor will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in us treasuries cash andor cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements the sponsor has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are · held on deposit with the fcm or other custodian · used for other investments and · held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves approximately  of the fund’s assets are expected to normally be committed as margin for futures contracts however from time to time the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more or less than such range ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for exchangetraded contracts based on changes in their value in light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchangetraded contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments it is not possible to estimate what portion of the fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time the us treasuries cash and cash equivalents held by the fund will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements all interest income will be used for the fund’s benefit the sponsor invests the balance of the fund’s assets not invested in futures or options on us treasuries with a maturity of  days or less cash and cash equivalents and such funds are available as reserves for changes in margin all interest income is used for the fund’s benefit an fcm counterparty government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the fund to hold trading positions at any time moreover margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held the assets of the fund posted as margin for futures contracts will be held in segregation pursuant to the cea and cftc regulations not specified company description the etf managers group commodity trust i the “trust” is a delaware statutory trust formed on july   the trust is a series trust formed pursuant to the delaware statutory trust act of which the fund is currently the sole series the fund is a commodity pool that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on the nyse arca stock exchange “nyse arca” the fund is managed and controlled by etf managers capital llc the “sponsor” a delaware limited liability company the sponsor is registered with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” as a commodity pool operator “cpo” and is a member of the national futures association “nfa” sit fixed income advisors ii llc “sit” is registered as a “commodity trading advisor” “cta” and will act as such for the fund the fund’s investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of a portfolio the “benchmark portfolio” consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on   and year us treasury securities “treasury instruments” weighted to achieve a targeted negative  year average effective portfolio duration the “benchmark component instruments” the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio the benchmark portfolio is maintained by sit and will be rebalanced reconstituted or both monthly typically on the th of each month and on the next business day if the th is a holiday weekend or other day on which the national exchanges are closed to maintain a negative  year average effective duration the benchmark portfolio and the fund will each maintain a short position in treasury instruments the fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio and anticipated rebalancing dates as well as the daily holdings of the fund are available on the fund’s website at wwwrisingrateetfcom the weighting of the treasury instruments constituting the benchmark component instruments will be based on each maturity’s duration contribution the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year and  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the relative weightings of the benchmark component instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve for example if the federal reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates in such an instance sit which maintains the benchmark portfolio will increase the weightings of the  year and reduce the weighting in the  year maturity treasury instruments conversely sit will do the opposite if the federal reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly on the th except for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative year average effective duration in which case sit will adjust the maturities of the treasury instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution the sponsor anticipates that approximately  to  of the fund’s assets will be used as payment for or collateral for treasury instruments in order to collateralize its treasury instrument positions the fund will hold such assets from which it will post margin to its futures commission merchant “fcm” in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange and transfer to its fcm any additional amounts that may be separately required by the fcm when establishing positions in treasury instruments the fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each treasury instrument position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the fcm on a daily basis the fund will be obligated to pay or entitled to receive variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its treasury instruments positions any assets not required to be posted as margin with the fcm will be held at the fund’s administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below the benchmark portfolio will be invested in benchmark component instruments and rebalanced as noted above to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately  years duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates for example if interest rates rise by  the market value of a security with an effective duration of  years would decrease by  with all other factors being constant and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative  years would increase by  with all other factors being constant duration estimates are based on assumptions by sit and are subject to a number of limitations duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in shortterm and longterm securities investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise the risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities the fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations the fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as us treasuries or other high credit quality shortterm fixedincome or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the treasury instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis these expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the fund’s nav and changes in the benchmark portfolio because the benchmark portfolio does not reflect expenses or income  the principal office of the trust and fund is located at  beechwood road suite b summit nj  the telephone number is   the sponsor’s principal
