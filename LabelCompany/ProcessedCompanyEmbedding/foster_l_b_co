management to provide investors and other users information to evaluate the performance of the companys segments on a more comparable basis to market trends and peers the exclusion of significant cost allocations to the reportable segments allows users to understand the operational performance of our reportable segments provides greater comparability to other registrants with similar businesses and avoids possible noncomparability at the reportable segment pretax profit level resulting from our specific corporate cost allocations and facilitates a clearer marketbased perspective on the strength or weakness of our reportable segments in their markets to better aid in investment decisions in addition these nongaap financial measures have historically been key metrics utilized by segment
