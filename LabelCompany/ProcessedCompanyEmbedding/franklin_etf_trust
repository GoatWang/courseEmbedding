principal generally those offering potential for higher returns are accompanied by a higher degree of risk stock prices fluctuate sometimes rapidly and dramatically due to factors affecting individual companies particular industries or sectors or general market conditions bond prices are affected by interest rate changes bond prices and thus a bond funds share price generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates as the price of bonds in a fund adjusts to a rise in interest rates the funds share price may decline special risks are associated with foreign investing including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors to the extent the fund focuses on particular countries regions industries sectors or types of investment from time to time it may be subject to greater risks of adverse developments in such areas of focus than a fund that invests in a wider variety of countries regions industries sectors or investments  smaller midsized and relatively new or unseasoned companies can be particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions and their prospects for growth are less certain than those of larger more established companies historically these securities have experienced more price volatility than larger company stocks especially over the

that a funds multifactor stock selection process will enhance performance exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments perhaps for extended periods  for actively managed etfs there is no guarantee that the managers investment decisions will produce the desired results these and other risks are discussed in the fund’s prospectus for more information on
