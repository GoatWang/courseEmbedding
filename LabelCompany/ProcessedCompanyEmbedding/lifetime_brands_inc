well plants and spices containing bioflavonoids have traditionally been used in eastern medicine and studied as a contributing factor to the outstanding heart health of the french and mediterranean populations bioflavonoids also demonstrate antioxidant activity as they are able to neutralize the free radicals that can cause oxidative stress damage to many of our cells what is quercetin quercetin

reduces damage caused by oxidation it also improves the efficacy of vitamins c and e two other wellknown antioxidants lipoic acid supports liver health immune system function healthy circulation clear vision and glucose metabolism as well as cardiovascular and neurological health its an important component of metabolic systems and since its both fat and watersoluble it has unique characteristics and a distinct advantage over other antioxidants alphalipoic acid ala is a naturallyoccurring compound that our body produces and that we also consume from dietary sources such as red meat spinach and wheat germ while our body produces sufficient lipoic acid under normal circumstances it may be considered a “conditionallyessential” nutrient like coenzyme q where the bodys own manufacture of alphalipoic acid may not be enough during conditions of oxidative stress in situations like this or for individuals who have a natural deficiency of this important antioxidant supplementation with alphalipoic acid would be extremely beneficial alphalipoic acids two primary functions alphalipoic acid serves two vital roles in the human body its an antioxidant as mentioned above and also a coenzyme that facilitates the action of enzymes in several metabolic functions as an antioxidant alphalipoic acid is useful in both oxidized and reduced forms which is rare among antioxidants in its oxidized form lipoic acid can scavenge free radicals and chelate or bond with metals in its reduced form as dihydrolipoic acid dhla it can regenerate other antioxidants like vitamins c and e and glutathione as well as repair oxidative damage alphalipoic acid is a “broad spectrum” antioxidant because of its activity in both oxidized and reduced forms its even more powerful an antioxidant than vitamin c or glutathione which makes it extremely potent indeed in addition to its antioxidant duties alphalipoic acid also serves as a coenzyme for the group of enzymes responsible for converting fats carbohydrates and proteins to biological energy or “cell fuel” this conversion takes place in the mitochondria the “battery” of your cell alphalipoic acid helps “burn” the metabolic intermediates and create energy for the cells easy and immediate use lipoic acid and healthy blood sugar metabolism plenty of evidence links increased oxidative stress with blood sugar imbalances as well as with insulin inefficiency unbalanced blood sugar levels may lead to increased production of free radicals oxidative stress can impact insulinstimulated glucose transportation and activation of insulin receptors making it harder for the body to move and detect sufficient levels of insulin in the blood alphalipoic acid has been shown to protect against the oxidative damage  so well in fact that scientists are acknowledging its ability to support tissue health even in instances where blood sugar levels are out of balance ala supplementation has also been found to support normal insulin sensitivity and efficiency in germany lipoic acid is used as a nutrient to support nerve health which can be impacted by blood sugar imbalances scientists and doctors agree that oxidized ldl the “bad” cholesterol is a high risk factor for suboptimal cardiovascular health studies have shown that alphalipoic acid can protect the integrity of ldl and other lipid molecules that have been exposed to oxidative stress as well as protect against protein glycation  which causes the production of free radicals and more oxidative damage that makes ala doubly effective in enhancing cardiovascular health unbalanced blood sugar levels can also lead to an accumulation of sorbitol in the eyes lens which can eventually affect visual function as a nutrient with antiglycation and antioxidant effects

overall wellness this company became aware of the unusually good health among the employees their subsequent investigation led to the discovery and production of epicor as a supplement to support human immune healthepicor production utilizes a proprietary process called metagen a multistage fermentation and drying process it contains both the yeast itself and the metabolites formed by the fermentation processfermentation is simply the chemical conversion of sugars into ethanol this process is wellknown to produce alcoholic beverages but it is also used in the leavening of bread and for

symptoms associated with seasonal immune complaints and experienced an overall shorter duration of symptoms compared to the placebo groupthe study associated with the initial discovery of epicors benefits compared the blood of  fermentation plant workers to age and gendermatched controls the results showed that the plant workers had significantly improved natural killer nk cell activity higher
