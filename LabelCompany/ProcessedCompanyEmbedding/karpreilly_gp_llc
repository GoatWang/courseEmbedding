patxi’s pizza gets boost from private equity investment posted in investment san francisco california patxi’s pizza gets boost from private equity investment exec says deal will help chain compete with fastcasual brands the patxi’s pizza chain is ramping up growth and testing new ovens that will help the fullservice deepdish concept compete with the growing crop of fastcasual pizza players the san franciscobased patxi’s — pronounced “pahcheese” — closed on a deal in february that gave privateequity firm karpreilly llc a controlling interest terms of the deal were not disclosed but bill freeman patxi’s chief executive said the growth capital will help support the unit chain’s planned expansion the chain plans to open four more units in  and another five to eight units in  the goal is to reach plus units within five years freeman said all units will be company owned and the chain has no plans to franchise freeman a former telecommunications entrepreneur founded patxi’s in  with friend and pizza chef francisco “patxi” azpiroz their aim was to create a warm and inviting neighborhood pizza joint offering chicagostyle deepdish pies with quality ingredients more recently patxi’s has been perfecting a thincrust addition to the menu the chain is testing and likely to roll out new electric degree ovens made specifically for thincrust pies that allow the chef to dial in the ideal cooking temperature for the top and bottom of the pizza thincrust pizzas will bake in about  minutes in the new ovens versus roughly  minutes in the chain’s existing ovens designed for the original signature deep dish that means guests will be able to order a custom pizza that can be served at a speed that would be more conducive to lunch it also means that patxi’s will be able to compete more directly with rapidly growing fastcasual pizza players like mod pizza blaze fast fire’d pizza and pizzarev “we can bake a pizza just as quickly as they can” noted freeman unlike the fastcasual pizza chains however patxi’s does about half of its business in dineout and delivery orders patxi’s also has a full bar with about  beers on tap the average check is about  and average unit volumes top  million in restaurants that are typically between  and  square feet said freeman the chain has recorded samestore sales increases of  percent or more over the past five years “overall the quality of our food is what differentiates us” he said “but people also see us as a great value you feel like you had a  experience for ” freeman said the partnership with karpreilly is a good fit for patxi’s karpreilly has a long history of investment in the restaurant space including chains such as café rio burger lounge café zupas habit burger grill miller’s ale house marie callender’s z tejas southwestern grill mimi’s café elephant bar the sprinkles cupcake concept and hooters as a result of the deal russ bendel habit burger’s chief executive and an industry veteran has joined patxi’s
