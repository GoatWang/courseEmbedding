commentary the first quarter of  concluded on a strong up swing as all of our divisions displayed notable quarteroverquarter topline revenue growth said seers ceo john combs we delivered solid operating results in our environmental technology and material divisions this confirms our commitment to growing this highermargin and recurring revenue side of the seer business we are particularly pleased with the progress mv technologies made in the first quarter of  with revenues up  to  million this also represented the highest revenue growth segment at seer  million in new purchase orders for our hsplus hydrogen sulfide removal system and highermargin sem revenues were generated in the first quarter we expect to continue growing this important component of our environmental technology solutions as our number of installations increase nationwide along with our new product media sales we are particularly focused on immediately leveraging our enhanced and expanded board of directors to increase our mv lfg installations and associated media sales our service offerings remain important and tactical revenue continued its upward trajectory reaffirming our belief that a material turnaround is in place regs also made progress during the first quarter driven in large part by the introduction of our new chemical cleaning services and our recent success in securing new customers both within and outside of the oil and gas sectors the momentum is continuing in the second quarter with our patented fugitive emission capture systems the vru™ and the vru plus™ systems as we announced recently we are aggressively targeting the canadian market with our new partner innovative energy technologies initially the collective efforts will be focused to deploy the fugitive emission capture technologies in major oil and gas fields located in western canada particularly the lloydminster area phase i will be to deploy its vru systems and phase ii will be to introduce the vru plus system that not only captures emissions but also produces natural gas liquids for resale or beneficial uses in oil field operations in canada these programs are currently much more developed and economically rewarding when compared to the us and we believe this market represents an imminent and potentially very lucrative opportunity for the company and our new canadian partners continued combs finally and most important yesterday we announced a major enhancement to our board and executive suite by appointing former usa waste services chairman and ceo donald moorehead as chairman of the seer board of directors and ceo of paragon waste solutions dons appointment represents one of the most important milestones in seers operating history to date and we believe the company is well positioned to make available to mr moorehead a unique portfolio of assets that will enable him to leverage his  years of successful acquisitions and mergers as well as decades of stellar operations across all aspects of waste markets worldwide the companys initial focus will be to provide mr moorehead with several patented technologies to change the way medical waste is handled in the us and abroad paragon as well as capture market share in the lfg space mv we couldnt be more excited to start the next phase of our growth cycle for our disruptive coronalux technology and our mv lfg environmental technology solutions technologies concluded combs first quarter  financial results total revenue in the first quarter of  increased  to  million compared to  million in the same yearago quarter this increase is primarily driven by an increase of approximately  million in environmental solutions revenue partially offset by a  million reduction in service revenue industrial and railcar

statements which speak only as of the date the statement was made unless the context requires otherwise when we refer to we us and our we are describing seer and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis overview seer was formed as a publicly traded company in early  through a reverse merger seer is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental cleantechnology businesses that provide safe innovative cost effective and profitable solutions in the oil  gas environmental waste management and renewable energy industries seer currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and midwestern us through these operating companies seer provides products and services throughout the us and has licensed and owned technologies with many customer installations throughout the us each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below the company also has noncontrolling interests in joint ventures some of which have no or minimal operations the companys domestic strategy is to grow internally through seers subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and simultaneously establish longterm alliances with andor acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy waste and water treatment and oil  gasindustrial services the focus of the seer family of companies however is to increase margins by securing or developing proprietary patented and patentpending technologies and then leveraging its  plusyear service experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control renewable green gas capture and sale compressed natural gas fuel generation as well as general solid waste and medicalpharmaceutical waste destruction many of seers current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams financial condition at december   we had approximately  million in negative working capital which represents a decrease of approximately  million from  million in negative working capital at december   the significant decrease in our working capital results primarily from the net loss before noncontrolling interest of  million for  we were notified by a significant customer that effective april   we would no longer be providing routine maintenance services but still would be eligible to bid on other industrial cleaning services the reduction of revenue from this customer during the year ended december   was approximately  million during the year ended december   the company opened additional rail car cleaning facilities in the midwest illinois and on the east coast maryland to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the refinery sector in may  regs filed an offer in compromise with the irs regs received a letter from the irs dated march   rejecting its offer in compromise and in accordance with the rejection letter regs has submitted a written appeal as a result of the irs rejection of the offer in compromise the installment plan mentioned in part  item  was terminated in june  regs received notices of intent to levy property or rights to property from the irs for the amounts owed for the past due payroll taxes penalty and interest the appeal submitted by regs was denied by the irs however the irs has not taken any current action as of december   the outstanding balance due to the irs was  and regs continues to be represented by tax counsel specializing in federal tax matters as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company has experienced recurring losses and has accumulated a deficit of approximately  million as of december   and  million as of december   for the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of approximately  million and  million respectively realization of a major portion of our assets as of december   is dependent upon our continued operations the company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable in addition we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern we continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing aggressive cost management and overhead reductions critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell permit and operate though our joint ventures and licensees our coronaluxtm waste destruction units we have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding markets attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission control regulations in addition the company is evaluating various forms of financing which may be available to it there can be no assurance that the company will secure additional financing for working capital increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years these financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the company be unable to report on a going concern basis results of operations results of operations for the years ended december   and  total revenues were  million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively the decrease of approximately  million or  in revenues comparing the year ended december   to the year ended december   is primarily attributable to the decreases in revenues from our industrial cleaning segment which decreased from approximately  million in  to approximately  million in  a decrease of  million or approximately  and was primarily attributable to a single customer our railcar cleaning segment revenues were  million for  compared to  million for  an increase of approximately  and the increase was attributable to an increase in the number of railcars serviced during that period our environmental solutions segment revenue increased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately  the increase is primarily attributable to higher media replacement sales and higher long term contract revenues our solid waste disposal segment generated  in  from the sale of  coronaluxtm units but did not generate any revenue from sales of coronaluxtm units during  the solid waste disposal segment also generated licensing and placement fees of  in  and  in  freight revenue of  in  as a result of the delivery of coronaluxtm units in  but  in  in addition the solid waste disposal segment generated approximately  in other fees for  compared to  in other fees for  the solid waste disposal segment has received approximately  in nonrefundable fees in  and from inception through december

fixed asset and other asset impairment and litigation settlement were approximately  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december    an increase of product cost of  million corresponds with the increase in product revenue by  over   a decrease in service costs of approximately  associated with a  decrease in service revenues of  million  a decrease in sga of approximately  million comparing  to  this was a result of decrease of professional fees of  million rent of  million marketing of  million salaries of  million share compensation of  million subcontractors and fuel of  million research and development of  million and an increase in insurance of  million and bad debts of  million  a decrease in solid waste costs of approximately  million associated with a  decrease in solid waste revenues of  service costs as a percentage of service revenues were  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   the decrease in margin is due to a reduced utilization of equipment and manpower as a result of the significant reduction in service revenue in  we saw a significant decrease in equipment and manpower utilization as a result of a significant decrease in revenue in  product costs as a percentage of product revenues was  in  compared to  in  the change is not significant but is primarily due to recurring product sales that typically have lower margins than the normal onetime long term projects that have higher margins solid waste costs were  million in  and  in  the decrease is primarily due to two factors  no sales of coronalux tm units in  and  an increase in personnel to support the placement and operation of coronalux tm units with customer along with product development and product enhancement activities sga expense decreased from approximately  million for the year ended december   to approximately  million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately  million the decrease in

million research and development of  million and an increase in insurance of  million and bad debts of  million the slight decrease in salaries and wages in  was due to a reduction on corporate

of  including the related legal fees total nonoperating other income expense net was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   the increase in  compared to  is

approximately  million and in  net noncash adjustments totaled  in  the net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in cash by approximately  million primarily due to the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  million an increase of  in billings in excess of revenue on uncompleted contracts offset by an increase of  in accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets of  the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the timing of invoicing on client contracts the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in  was primarily increases in vendor payables due to the significant increase in environmental solutions revenue in  in  the net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in cash by approximately  million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of  million and the decrease in fixed assets from the sale of  coronaluxtm units for  in  other changes in operating assets and liabilities offset each other resulting in no significant change in cash investing activities net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures our net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   in  we had addition to property and equipment of  increases in intangible assets of  and received  of insurance proceeds financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for  and  for  proceeds from the sale of common stock and exercise and extension of warrants was

payments on related party notes payable was  in  and  in  overall our cash changed very minimally from  to  primarily due to our net loss from operations offset by lower capital expenditures sale of common stock and exercise and extension of warrants and debt financing in  that provided some working capital to offset our operating losses critical accounting policies judgments and estimates use of estimates the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of intangible assets valuation allowances and reserves for receivables inventory and deferred income taxes revenue recognition related to contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method sharebased compensation and loss contingencies including those related to litigation actual results could differ from those estimates accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable historical experience and management judgment accounts receivable balances are reviewed individually for collectability and balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that the potential for recovery is remote an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  and  had been reserved as of december   and  respectively we are exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business primarily related to accounts receivable our customers operate primarily in the oil production and refining rail transport biogas generating and wastewater treatment industries in the united states accordingly we are affected by the economic conditions in these industries as well as general economic conditions in the united states to limit credit risk management periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   and  we do not believe that we have significant credit risk fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of our financial instruments including accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost which approximates their fair value due to their shortterm maturities we believe that the carrying value of notes payable with third parties including their current portion approximate their fair value as those instruments carry market interest rates based on our current financial condition and liquidity we believe the amounts due to related parties also approximate their fair value as their carried interest rates are consistent with those of our notes payable with third parties longlived assets we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable an asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows for the year ended december   the company recognized an impairment to five coronalux tm units of  no impairment was determined as of december   revenue recognition we recognize revenue related to contract projects and services when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an agreement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured our revenue is primarily comprised of services related to industrial cleaning and railcar cleaning which we recognize as services are rendered product revenue generated from projects which include the manufacturing of products for removal and treatment of hazardous vapor and gasses is accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method for projects with durations in excess of three months and the completedcontract method for all other projects total estimated revenue includes all of the following  the basic contract price  contract options and  change orders once contract performance is underway we may experience changes in conditions client requirements specifications designs materials and expectations regarding the period of performance such changes are change orders and may be initiated by us or by our clients in many cases agreement with the client as to the terms of change orders is reached prior to work commencing however sometimes circumstances require that work progress without obtaining client agreement revenue related to change orders is recognized as costs are incurred if it is probable that costs will be recovered by changing the contract price the company does not incur precontract costsunder the percentageofcompletion method we recognize revenue primarily based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses are identified and included as additional loss provisions for estimated losses on contracts are shown separately as liabilities on the balance sheet if significant except in circumstances in which related costs are accumulated on the balance sheet in which case the provisions are deducted from the accumulated costs a provision as a liability is reported as a current liability for contracts accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method we include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction contracts realizable and payable costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent the excess of contract costs and profits recognized to date over billings to date and are recognized as a current asset billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits recognized to date and are recognized as a current liability the companys revenues from waste destruction licensing agreements are recognized as a single accounting unit over the term of the license in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  for revenues which contain multiple deliverables the company separates the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria i the delivered items have a standalone value to the customer ii the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined and iii if the arrangement includes a general right of return delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting unit revenue from each accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature primarily asc  the company has fiveyear agreements with three companies in which the company amortizes various fees on a straightline basis over the initial fiveyear term of the agreement stockbased compensation we account for stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation over the service period that they are expected to vest we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated value of the portion of a stockbased award that is ultimately expected to vest taking into consideration estimated forfeitures is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised recently issued accounting pronouncements changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap are established by the financial accounting standards board fasb in the form of accounting standards updates asus to the fasbs accounting standards codification the company considers the applicability and impact of all new or revised asus new accounting pronouncements implemented in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance creating accounting standards codification asc section  revenue from contracts with customers the new section will replace section  revenue recognition and creates modifications to various other revenue accounting standards for specialized transactions and industries the section is intended to conform revenue accounting principles with a concurrently issued international financial reporting standards with previously differing treatment between united states practice and those of much of the rest of the world as well as to enhance disclosures related to disaggregated revenue information the updated guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those annual periods on july   the fasb approved a one year delay of the effective date the company will now adopt the new provisions of this accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year  in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  compensation  stock compensation topic  accounting for sharebased payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period asu  current us gaap does not contain explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a nonvesting condition that affects the grantdate fair value of an award the new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grantdate fair value of the award the updated guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period the adoption of this asu did not have any impact on the companys consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations in april  the fasb issued asu  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs asu  asu  requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts asu  is effective for the

of nevada on february   for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses under the name of satellite organizing solutions inc “sozg” in january  sozg changed its name to strategic environmental  energy resources inc reduced its number of outstanding shares through a reverse stock split and consummated the acquisition of both regs llc and tactical cleaning company llc seer is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental cleantechnology businesses that provide safe innovative cost effective and profitable solutions in the oil  gas environmental waste management and renewable energy industries seer currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and midwestern us through these operating companies seer provides products and services throughout the us and has licensed technologies with many customer installations throughout the us each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below the company also has noncontrolling interests in joint ventures some of which have no or minimal operations   the company’s domestic strategy is to grow internally through seer’s subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and simultaneously establish longterm alliances with andor acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy waste and water treatment and oil  gas services the focus of the seer family of companies however is to increase margins by securing or developing proprietary patented and patentpending technologies and then leveraging its  plusyear service experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control renewable “green gas” capture and sale compressed natural gas “cng” fuel generation as well as general solid waste and medicalpharmaceutical waste destruction many of seer’s current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams   the company now owns and manages five operating entities and one entity that has no significant operations to date   subsidiaries   regs llc dba resource environmental group services “regs” operating since  provides general industrial cleaning services and waste management to many industry sectors focusing primarily on oil  gas production upstream and refineries downstream   tactical cleaning company llc “tactical” operating since  provides cleaning services to the tanker rail car industry with offices in two states and a focus on both foodgrade

agricultural and food product processors wastewater treatment facilities and petroleum product refiners mv also develops and designs proprietary technologies and systems used to condition biogas for use as renewable natural gas “rng” for a number of applications such as transportation fuel and natural gas pipeline injection   paragon waste solutions llc “pws” formed late  pws is an operating company that has developed a patented waste destruction technology using a pyrolytic heating process combined with “nonthermal plasma” assisted oxidation this technique involves gasification of solid waste by heating the waste in a lowoxygen environment followed by complete oxidation at higher temperatures in the presence of plasma the term “nonthermal plasma” refers to a low energy ionized gas that is generated by electrical discharges between two electrodes this technology commercially referred to as coronalux™ is designed and intended for the “clean” destruction of hazardous chemical and biological waste ie  hospital “red bag” waste thereby eliminating the need for costly segregation transportation incineration or landfill with their associated legacy liabilities pws is a  owned subsidiary          reachbiogas “reach” trade name for benefuels llc formed february  owned  by seer reach develops renewable natural gas projects that convert raw biogas into pipeline quality gas andor renewable “rng” for fleet vehicles reach has had minimal operations as of december     seer environmental materials llc “sem” formed september  is a wholly owned subsidiary established as a materials technology business with the purpose of developing advanced chemical absorbents and catalysts that enhance the capability of biogas produced from landfill wastewater treatment operations and agricultural digester operations   joint ventures   mv rcm joint venture  in april  mv technologies inc “mv” and rcm international llc “rcm” entered into an agreement to develop hybrid scrubber systems that employ elements of rcm technology and mv technology the “joint venture” rcm and mv technologies will independently market the hybrid scrubber systems the contractual joint venture has an initial term of five years and will automatically renew for successive oneyear periods unless either party gives the other party one hundred and eighty  days’ notice prior to the applicable renewal date operations to date of the joint venture have been limited to formation activities   paragon waste uk ltd  in june  pws and pci consulting ltd “pci” formed paragon waste uk ltd “paragon uk joint venture” to develop permit and exploit the pws waste destruction technology within the territory of ireland and the united kingdom pws and pci each own  of the voting shares of paragon uk joint venture operations to date of the paragon uk joint venture have been limited to formation the delivery of a coronalux™ unit with a third party in the united kingdom and application and permitting efforts with regulatory entities   pp company  in february  pws and particle science tech of environmental protection inc “particle science” formed a joint venture particle  paragon environmental solutions inc “pp” to exploit the pws technology in china including hong kong macao and taiwan pws and particle science each own  of pp operations to date have been limited to formation of pp and the sale and delivery of a coronalux™ unit to particle science in china   pws mws joint venture  in october  pws and medical waste services llc “mws” formed a contractual joint venture to exploit the pws medical waste destruction technology in  mws licensed and installed a coronalux™ unit at an mws facility and subsequently received a limited permit to operate from the south coast air quality management district “scaqmd” and the california department of public health operations to date have included the destruction of medical waste while demonstrating the ultralow emissions necessary for application of a more expansive operating permit submitted to scaqmd in march  and scaqmd issued a ‘notice of intent to issue permit to operate’ in march           segment information   the company currently has identified four segments as follows            of annual revenues           regs   industrial cleaning     tcc   rail car cleaning     mv sem   environmental solutions     pws   solid waste       reach is not currently operating but when operations commence it would be part of the environmental solutions segment the mv rcm joint venture is not currently operating but when operations commence it would be part of the environmental solutions segment   as of december   and  we had one customer with sales in excess of  of our revenue and they represented approximately  and  of total revenues for the year ended december   and  respectively the loss of this customer or a material reduction in revenue from this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business our results of operations and our working capital in early  we were notified by this significant customer that effective april   we would no longer be providing routine maintenance services but still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services during  the loss of revenue from this customer was approximately  million see notes  and  to the consolidated financial statements and item a risk factors   financial condition   as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company has experienced recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit of approximately  million as of december   and for the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses before noncontrolling interest of approximately  million and  million respectively as of december   and  our current liabilities exceed our current assets by approximately  million and  million respectively our total liabilities exceed total assets at december   by approximately  million and at december   our total assets exceeded our total liabilities by approximately  million the primary reason for the increase in negative working capital and the reduction in total assets over total liabilities from  to  is due to the impairment of paragon coronalux™ waste destruction units the impairment of a long term asset litigation settlement costs and the net loss incurred in  as noted above also see notes  and  to the consolidated financial statements in early  regs a wholly owned subsidiary was notified that effective april   it would no longer be providing routine maintenance services to its largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services the loss of revenue from this customer was approximately  million for the year ended december   the company opened an additional rail car cleaning facility in the midwest illinois and east coast maryland to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the refinery sector   realization of a major portion of our assets as of december   is dependent upon our continued operations the company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable in addition we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern we continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies diversifying our service customer and market concentrations and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing aggressive cost management and overhead reductions critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell permit and operate through our joint ventures and licensees our coronalux™ waste destruction units we have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding domestic markets attributable to increased federal and state emission control regulations particularly in the nation’s oil and gas fields and a growing demand for energy conservation and renewable energies in addition the company is evaluating various forms of financing that may be available to it there can be no assurance that the company will secure additional financing for working capital increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years these financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the company be unable to report on a going concern basis          industry   seer with its diverse services technologies and environmental solution offerings participates in the worldwide markets of industrial cleaning environmental compliance renewable energy and waste minimizationmanagement there are everincreasing emissions and solid waste regulations and statutory programs at the local state federal and international levels that create and mandate the need for renewable energies and waste minimization proper handling storage treatment and disposal of virtually all types of waste   the industrial waste management industry in north america was shaped first by the resource conservation and recovery act of  “rcra” which requires waste generators to among other things store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations subsequent to rcra growing national awareness of environmental issues coupled with corporate and institutional awareness of environmental liabilities have contributed to the growth of the industry and associated governing legislation on the state and federal levels   today collection and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes are subject to local state and federal requirements and controls that regulate health safety the environment zoning and landuse included in these regulations is the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  “cercla” of the united states cercla holds generators and transporters of hazardous substances as well as past and present owners and operators of sites where there has been a hazardous release strictly jointly and severally liable for environmental cleanup costs resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous materials   the enactment of the federal clean air act of  caa resulted in a major shift in the federal government’s role in air pollution control this legislation authorized the development of comprehensive federal and state regulations to limit emissions from both stationary industrial sources and mobile sources the act has been amended and expanded in scope many times since its enactment and remains a major consideration for safely and responsibly conducting business in the us   these and countless other similar regulatory programs mandate the need for environmental and industrial cleaning services and technologies such as those offered by seer and its companies   there are substantial barriers to entry in the waste management industry including the high degree of expertise and training required regulatory compliance insurance and licensing costs and procedures strict federal state provincial and local permitting and oversight processes and significant capital costs of equipment and qualified personnel   business strategy   seer’s growth to date has been fueled by a combination of synergistic and vertical integration acquisitions strategic alliances and organic growth seer acquired regs tactical and mv as whollyowned subsidiaries in  sem was created to provide recurring and highmargin revenue to the company by offering an internal source of diverse media solutions that are required for the treatment of various waste and off gas streams this also enables greater pricing flexibility by the technology solutions affiliates that in turn should result in increased sales of systems that leads to greater demand of media the increased installation and demand for media change outs also creates service opportunities for the company’s service sector we intend to continue pursuing an aggressive strategy of both acquisitions and organic growth while expanding our geographic footprint into other regions of the united states and foreign markets potential acquisitions may include businesses that secure supply chain and vendor logistics or are complementary to our core businesses or companies that provide a similar set of services in regions where the company does not currently have operations   upon full development of certain of our patented and patentpending technologies we intend to explore licensing relationships with larger established companies to generate sustainable revenue streams from both domestic and international applications          intellectual property   mv was issued a patent in  related to “oilgas vapor collection storage and recovery system etc” patent no us  b mv was issued a second patent in  titled “fugitive gas capture” us patent no  b that expanded claims in the earlier patent the patents will expire in  and  respectively unless otherwise extended mv is in the process of expanding the scope and number of claims of this issued patent   in  pws filed provisional and nonprovisional patent applications in the name and for the benefit of seer arising out of and related to its waste disposal technology involving a pyrolitic first phase and a “cold plasma” second phase system referred to as “plasma light” or coronalux™ technology in october  seer was issued patent no  for this coronalux™ technology in  pws filed a provisional patent related to destruction of volatile organic compounds a pyrolytic process is basically the decomposition of any material at elevated temperatures in a very low oxygencontaining atmosphere as compared to conventional incineration or pyrolysis processes in july  seer was issued patent no  for this coronalux™ technology the patents will expire in    competition   the industrial services industry is highly competitive our competitors vary in size geographical coverage and by the mix of services they offer our larger competitors include philip services clean harbors and veolia environmental services additionally we compete with a number of small and medium size companies in the face of this competition we have been effective in growing our revenue due to the wide range of services we offer a competitive pricing structure our innovative and proprietarypatent pending technologies and a reputation for reliability built over the nearly  years of business operations as well as the care we take in performing and completing each customer project   in all its businesses the company currently holds very small parts of very large and growing markets mv competes by providing superior hydrogen sulfide “h  s” “scrubbing” solutions that result in more cost effective removal of h  s from process gas streams h  s is highly corrosive and is a precursor to sulfur dioxide a highly regulated air pollutant therefore removing h  s from industrial process waste streams is important in order to enhance the safety of personnel extend the life of industrial equipment and to minimize resulting air pollution in the markets served by mv there are a number of competing technologies employed such as biological scrubbing chemical scrubbing and dry scrubbing with activated carbon regs and tactical cleaning company compete by offering superior customer response and lower total cost of service pws plans to compete by offering a unique onsite ondemand waste destruction solution eliminating the need for waste segregation transportation incineration autoclaving andor landfilling in turn eliminating all of the associated costs and legacy liabilities associated with current options for medical waste handling we believe that the patented coronalux™ technology results in a radically superior option in the medical waste management sector and in ultimate emissions cleaner than other solutions available in the market   environmental matters and regulation   significant federal environmental laws affecting us are the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” also known as the “superfund act” the clean air act the clean water act and the toxic substances control act “tsca”   rcra rcra is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation treatment transportation storage and disposal pursuant to rcra the us environmental protection agency the “epa” has established a comprehensive “cradletograve” system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous or solid waste states that have adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the epa have been delegated authority by the epa to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the epa’s program every facility that treats stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a rcra permit from the epa or an authorized state agency unless a specific exemption exists and must comply with certain operating requirements           the superfund act the superfund act is the primary federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties it also provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the epa of the release of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the government to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order responsible persons to perform any necessary cleanup the statute provides for strict and in certain cases joint and several liability for these responses and other related costs and for liability for the cost of damages to natural resources to the parties involved in the generation transportation and disposal of such hazardous substances under the statute we may be deemed liable as a generator or transporter of a hazardous substance which is released into the environment or as the owner or operator of a facility from which there is a release of a hazardous substance into the environment   the clean air act the clean air act was passed by congress to control the emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits to be obtained for certain sources of toxic air pollutants such as vinyl chloride or criteria pollutants such as carbon monoxide in  congress amended the clean air act to require further reductions of air pollutants with specific targets for nonattainment areas in order to meet certain ambient air quality standards these amendments also require the epa to promulgate regulations which i control emissions of  hazardous air pollutants ii create uniform operating permits for major industrial facilities similar to rcra operating permits iii mandate the phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals and iv provide for enhanced enforcement   clean water act this legislation prohibits discharges into the waters of the united states without governmental authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources including disposal sites and treatment facilities    toxic substances control act tsca established a national program for the management of substances classified as pcbs which include waste pcbs as well as rcra wastes contaminated with pcbs we conduct field services remediation activities that are regulated under provisions of the tsca   other federal laws in addition to regulations specifically directed at the transportation storage and disposal facilities there are a number of regulations that may “passthrough” to the facilities based on the acceptance of regulated waste from affected client facilities each facility that accepts affected waste must comply with the regulations for that waste facility or industry in our transportation operations we are regulated by the us department of transportation the federal railroad administration the federal aviation administration and the us coast guard as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass health and safety standards under the occupational safety and health act or “osha” are applicable to all of our operations   pursuant to the epa’s authorization of their rcra equivalent programs a number of states have regulatory programs governing the permitting and operation of hazardous waste facilities our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes including those addressing clean water and clean air our facilities are also subject to local siting zoning and land use restrictions although our facilities occasionally have been cited for regulatory violations we believe we are in substantial compliance with all federal state and local laws regulating our business    incomepayroll taxes   in  and  regs a subsidiary of the company became delinquent for unpaid federal employer and employee payroll taxes and accrued interest and penalties related to the unpaid payroll taxes   in or around  regs retained washington dcbased legal counsel specializing in resolving federal tax matters regs has been represented by this firm throughout all phases of this tax matter and related proceedings in september  regs received approval from the internal revenue service “irs” to begin paying the outstanding federal payroll tax liability plus related interest and penalties totaling approximately  in installments the “installment plan” under the installment plan we were required to pay minimum monthly installments of  commencing september  which increased to  per month in september  until the liability was paid in full through the duration of the installment plan the irs continued to charge penalties and interest at statutory rates if the conditions of the installment plan were not met the irs could cancel it and could demand the outstanding liability to be repaid through traditional enforcement proceedings available to the irs additionally the irs has filed a notice of federal tax lien against certain of regs assets in order to secure the obligation the irs is to release this lien if and when we pay the full amount due two of the officers of regs also have liability exposure for a portion of the taxes if regs does not pay them          in may  regs filed an offer in compromise “oic” with the irs while the oic was under review by the irs the requirement to pay  a month under the installment plan was suspended regs was informed by its legal counsel that the irs had accepted regs’ oic however by a letter dated march   regs was notified that the oic had been rejected regs appealed that rejection decision however that appeal has been denied as a result the installment plan is terminated in june  regs received notices of intent to levy property or rights to property from the irs for the amounts owed for the past due payroll taxes penalty and interest the irs has not taken any current action against regs and regs continues to be represented by its legal counsel   as of december   and december   the outstanding balance due to the irs was  and  respectively   other than this outstanding payroll tax matter arising in  and  all state and federal taxes have been paid by regs in a timely manner   insurance   to cover potential risks associated with the variety of services that the operating companies provide we maintain adequate insurance coverages including  casualty insurance providing coverage for commercial general liability automotive liability professional liability insurance and employee benefits liability in the amounts of  million each respectively per year  contractor’s pollution liability insurance which has limits of  million per occurrence and  million in the aggregate  transportation liability insurance with a  million per occurrence and  an excess umbrella liability policy of  million per occurrence and  million aggregate limit overall   health safety and compliance   preserving the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate as well as remaining in compliance with local state and federal rules and regulations are the highest priorities for us and our companies we strive to maintain the highest professional standards in our compliance and health and safety activities to achieve this objective we have an inhouse fulltime health  safety officer and emphasize comprehensive training programs for new employees as well as ongoing mandatory refresher programs and safety bonus programs for existing employees these programs are administered at both the corporate and field levels on a daily basis our efforts to ensure the health and safety of employees have been formally recognized by our customers as well as by the colorado department of labor and employment   research and development   research and development “rd” costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses rd expenses consist primarily of salaries project materials contract labor and other costs associated with ongoing product development and enhancement efforts we spent approximately  and  on rd for the years ended december   and  respectively   employees   as of december   we employed approximately  full time nonunion hourly and salaried employees there is some seasonality to our business which requires us to use day laborers   public information   persons interested in obtaining information on the company may read and copy any materials that we file with the commission at the sec’s public reference room at  f street ne washington dc  on official business days during the hours of  am to  pm the public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the commission at sec the commission maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the commission at httpwwwsecgov          item a risk factors   an investment in our securities involves certain risk factors including those described below investors should carefully consider these risk factors along with information included or referred to in this report as well as other sec filings before investing in our securities   risks relating to our business   our business and results of operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to secure reasonably priced insurance that is required for our operations   because our business sometimes involves the handling and disposal of hazardous materials we are required to maintain insurance coverage that can be expensive our ability to continue conducting business could be adversely affected if we should become unable to secure sufficient insurance coverage surety bonds and financial assurances at reasonable cost to meet our business and regulatory requirements the availability of insurance could be affected by factors outside of our control as well as the insurers’ or sureties’ assessment of our risk   the environmental services industry in which we participate is subject to significant economic and business risks   our future operating results may be affected by such factors as our ability to win new business and remain competitive in the face of price competition from competitors who are often larger and better capitalized than us maintain andor build market share in an industry that has experienced downsizing and consolidation reduce costs without negatively impacting operations minimize downtime and disruptions of operations weather economic downturns or recessionary conditions   a significant portion of our business is derived as a result of events and circumstances over which we have no control   certain services that we provide are impacted by events such as accidental spills of hazardous materials increasingly stringent environmental regulations governing hazardous waste handling and seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers’ spending for remedial activities many of our customers are affected by the price of crude oil and refined products primarily because these customers do not produce crude oil but must purchase crude oil in the market the fluctuating price of crude oil can have a significant impact on their operating margins unfavorable or volatile trends in fossil fuel prices oil diesel natural gas may result in decreased demand for the company’s services we do not control such factors and as a result our revenue and income can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year prior financial performance for certain periods may not be a reliable indicator of future performance for comparable periods in subsequent years   seasonality makes it harder for us to manage our business and for investors to evaluate our performance   our operations may be affected by seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers’ needs for remedial and other services that we provide this seasonality in our business makes it harder for us to manage our business and for investors to evaluate our performance   our common stock is thinly traded the prices at which it trades are volatile and the buying or selling actions of a few shareholders may adversely affect our stock price   as of december   we had a public float which is defined as shares outstanding minus shares held by our officers directors or beneficial holders of greater than  of our outstanding common stock and restricted common stock of  shares or  of our outstanding common stock the average number of shares traded in any given day over the past year approximately  has been relatively small compared to the public float for the year ended december   we traded a total of  shares or  of our public float thus the actions of a few shareholders either buying or selling shares of our common stock may adversely affect the price of the shares historically securities similar to our common stock have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that do not necessarily relate to operating performance          because our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate the market price for our stock may be volatile   our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future fluctuations in operating results may result in volatility of the price of our common stock these quarterly and annual fluctuations may result from a number of factors including the size of new contracts and when we are able to recognize the related revenue our rate of progress under our contracts the timing of customer and market acceptance of our products and service offerings budgeting cycles of our customers the mix of products and services sold changes in demand for our products and services level and timing of expenses for product development and sales general and administrative expenses competition changes in our strategy general economic conditions   personnel costs are a significant component of our budgeted expense levels and therefore our expenses are to a degree variable based upon our expectations regarding future revenue our revenue is difficult to forecast because the market for our products and services is rapidly changing and our sales cycle and the size and timing of significant contracts varies substantially among customers accordingly we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue any significant shortfall from anticipated levels of demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   based on these factors we believe our future quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result quartertoquarter and yeartoyear comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful nor do they indicate what our future performance will be furthermore we believe that in future reporting periods if our operating results fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors it is possible that the market price of our common stock could go down   our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage our liquidity   our ability to meet our obligations as they come due could be negatively impacted if we are unable to invoice and collect from our customers in a timely manner if our revenue levels fall below forecast or expenses exceed what we projected or an unexpected adverse event or combination of events occurs therefore if the timing of cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements we may require access to additional funds to support our business objectives through debt restructuring a credit facility or possibly the issuance of additional equity additional financing may not be available at all or if available may not be obtainable on terms that are favorable to us and not dilutive as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company has experienced recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit of approximately  million as of december   for the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses before noncontrolling interest of approximately  million and  million respectively as of december   our current liabilities exceed our current assets by approximately  million   our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   our financial statements as of december   have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our need to obtain additional financing and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity financing or other capital attain further operating efficiencies reduce expenditures and ultimately to generate revenue          the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty we are continually evaluating opportunities to raise additional funds through public or private equity financings as well as evaluating prospective business partners and will continue to do so however if adequate funds are not available to us when we need it and we are unable to enter into some form of strategic relationship that will give us access to additional cash resources we will be required to even further curtail our operations which would in turn further raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   we depend on a limited number of significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our business   we earn a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers the loss of any significant customer or a material reduction in revenues from the sale of product or services delays in delivery or acceptance of any of our products by a customer delays in the performance of services for a customer or delays in collection of customer receivables could have a negative impact on our business and operating results effective april   we were notified that we would no longer be providing routine maintenance services to our largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services the loss of revenue from this customer in  was approximately  million see note  to the consolidated financial statements   our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees   our ability to manage future expansion if any effectively will require us to attract train motivate and manage new employees successfully to integrate new management and employees into our overall operations and to continue to improve our operations financial and management systems we may not be able to retain personnel or to hire additional personnel on a timely basis if at all because of the complexity and training required in certain of our services a significant time lag exists between the hiring date of technical and sales personnel and the time when they become fully productive our failure to retain personnel or to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis could adversely affect our business by impacting our ability to service certain customers and to secure new contracts   we are subject to extensive environmental regulations that may increase our costs and potential liabilities   the operations of all companies in the environmental services industry are subject to federal state provincial and local environmental requirements although increasing environmental regulation often presents new business opportunities for us it also results in increased operating and compliance costs efforts to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including environmental rules and regulations require programs to promote compliance such as training employees and customers purchasing health and safety equipment and in some cases hiring outside consultants even with these programs we and other companies in the environmental services industry are faced with governmental enforcement proceedings which can result in fines or other sanctions and require expenditures for remedial work on waste management facilities and contaminated sites certain of these laws impose strict and under certain circumstances joint and several liability for cleanup of releases of regulated materials and also liability for related natural resource damages   at some time in the future we may be required to pay fines or penalties due to regulatory enforcement proceedings and such fines or penalties could have a negative impact on our earnings additionally regulatory authorities have the power to suspend or revoke permits or licenses needed for our operations which may affect our customers’ willingness to do business with us andor out ability to conduct business this in turn would impact our revenue and profitability to date we have never had any of our operating permits revoked suspended or nonrenewed involuntarily although it is possible that could occur in the future   changes in environmental regulations or entry into related businesses may require us to make significant capital expenditures   changes in environmental regulations or our entry into new businesses could require us to make significant capital expenditures periodically the government revises rules and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous waste that requires us and other companies in the environmental services industry to invest in new equipment training or other areas in order to remain in compliance additionally because we intend to expand our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses we anticipate the need to raise additional capital to support these acquisitions future environmental regulations and acquisitions could cause us to make significant additional capital expenditures and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow          if our internal growth objectives prove to be inaccurate our results of operations could be adversely affected   while we believe that increasing environmental regulations and our growing product and services portfolio provide us with ample growth opportunities it is possible that we will not be able to achieve our internal growth objectives due to causes such as a lack of growth capital intense competition regulatory issues loss of permits and licenses and other factors likewise while we also intend to grow through acquisition it is possible that we will be unable to grow this way due to lack of adequate financing lack of viable acquisition candidates competition for possible acquisitions and other factors to the extent that our growth objectives prove to be significantly different than actual results our results of operations could be adversely affected   disruptions from terrorist activities or military actions may have an adverse effect on our business   the continued threat of terrorism within the us and acts of war may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders delays in collecting cash a general decrease in corporate spending or our inability to effectively market manufacture or ship our products we are unable to predict whether war and the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any longterm commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any longterm material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows   we do business in a highly competitive industry and compete with companies that have substantially more resources that we do   the industrial services industry is highly competitive several of the companies with which we compete are larger offer more services and products have better access to growth capital have larger sales and marketing departments and larger workforces and other advantages that may make it difficult for us to win new business when in competition with them   we have not paid and do not expect in the foreseeable future to pay dividends on our common stock   we have not paid and do not anticipate paying for the foreseeable future any dividends on our common stock we intend to reinvest future earnings if any into the operation and expansion of our business and payment of our outstanding debt   certain directors and officers own substantial amounts of our common stock and as a group will have the ability to exercise substantial influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval   as of december   j john combs iii president ceo and director of seer and michael j cardillo founder and president of our regs subsidiary and fortunato villamagna president of our pws subsidiary beneficially held approximately  of our outstanding common stock the beneficial ownership of all officers and directors at december   was  as a result our directors and officers may be able to exercise substantial influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transactions these stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders the significant concentration of stock ownership might cause the trading price of our common stock to decline if investors were to perceive that conflicts of interest may exist or arise over any such potential transactions potential future sales of common stock by our directors and executive officers and our other principal stockholders may cause our stock price to fall          we depend on certain key personnel    we are highly dependent on a limited number of key management personnel particularly our president and ceo j john combs iii fortunato villamagna president of our subsidiary pws mike cardillo president of our subsidiary regs and richard robertson coo of seer and president of our subsidiary mv technologies our loss of key personnel to death disability or termination or our inability to hire and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flow   general risk statement    based on all of the foregoing we believe it is possible for future revenue expenses and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result quartertoquarter and yeartoyear comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance furthermore we believe that it is possible that in any given quarter or fiscal year our operating results could differ from the expectations of public market analysts or investors in such event or in the event that adverse conditions prevail or are perceived to prevail with respect to our business

“our” we are describing seer and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis   overview   seer was formed as a publicly traded company in early  through a reverse merger seer is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental cleantechnology businesses that provide safe innovative cost effective and profitable solutions in the oil  gas environmental waste management and renewable energy industries seer currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and midwestern us through these operating companies seer provides products and services throughout the us and has licensed and owned technologies with many customer installations throughout the us each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below the company also has noncontrolling interests in joint ventures some of which have no or minimal operations   the company’s domestic strategy is to grow internally through seer’s subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and simultaneously establish longterm alliances with andor acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy waste and water treatment and oil  gasindustrial services the focus of the seer family of companies however is to increase margins by securing or developing proprietary patented and patentpending technologies and then leveraging its  plusyear service experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control renewable “green gas” capture and sale compressed natural gas fuel generation as well as general solid waste and medicalpharmaceutical waste destruction many of seer’s current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams   financial condition   at december   we had approximately  million in negative working capital which represents a decrease of approximately  million from  million in negative working capital at december   the significant decrease in our working capital results primarily from the net loss before noncontrolling interest of  million for  we were notified by a significant customer that effective april   we would no longer be providing routine maintenance services but still would be eligible to bid on other industrial cleaning services the reduction of revenue from this customer during the year ended december   was approximately  million during the year ended december   the company opened additional rail car cleaning facilities in the midwest illinois and on the east coast maryland to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the refinery sector          in may  regs filed an offer in compromise with the irs regs received a letter from the irs dated march   rejecting its offer in compromise and in accordance with the rejection letter regs has submitted a written appeal as a result of the irs rejection of the offer in compromise the installment plan mentioned in part  item  was terminated in june  regs received notices of intent to levy property or rights to property from the irs for the amounts owed for the past due payroll taxes penalty and interest the appeal submitted by regs was denied by the irs however the irs has not taken any current action as of december   the outstanding balance due to the irs was  and regs continues to be represented by tax counsel specializing in federal tax matters   as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company has experienced recurring losses and has accumulated a deficit of approximately  million as of december   and  million as of december   for the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of approximately  million and  million respectively   realization of a major portion of our assets as of december   is dependent upon our continued operations the company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable in addition we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern we continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing aggressive cost management and overhead reductions critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell permit and operate though our joint ventures and licensees our coronalux™ waste destruction units we have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding markets attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission control regulations in addition the company is evaluating various forms of financing which may be available to it there can be no assurance that the company will secure additional financing for working capital increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years these financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the company be unable to report on a going concern basis   results of operations   results of operations for the years ended december   and    total revenues were  million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively the decrease of approximately  million or  in revenues comparing the year ended december   to the year ended december   is primarily attributable to the decreases in revenues from our industrial cleaning segment which decreased from approximately  million in  to approximately  million in  a decrease of  million or approximately  and was primarily attributable to a single customer our railcar cleaning segment revenues were  million for  compared to  million for  an increase of approximately  and the increase was attributable to an increase in the number of railcars serviced during that period our environmental solutions segment revenue increased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately  the increase is primarily attributable to higher media replacement sales and higher long term contract revenues our solid waste disposal segment generated  in  from the sale of  coronalux™ units but did not generate any revenue from sales of coronalux™ units during  the solid waste disposal segment also generated licensing and placement fees of  in  and  in  freight revenue of  in  as a result of the delivery of coronalux™ units in  but  in  in addition the solid waste disposal segment generated approximately  in other fees for  compared to  in other fees for  the solid waste disposal segment has received approximately  in nonrefundable fees in  and from inception through december    which are being recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreements          operating expenses which include cost of products cost of services and selling general and administrative sga expenses fixed asset and other asset impairment and litigation settlement were approximately  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december    an increase of product cost of  million corresponds with the increase in product revenue by  over   a decrease in service costs of approximately  associated with a  decrease in service revenues of  million  a decrease in sga of approximately  million comparing  to  this was a result of decrease of professional fees of  million rent of  million marketing of  million salaries of  million share compensation of  million subcontractors and fuel of  million research and development of  million and an increase in insurance of  million and bad debts of  million  a decrease in solid waste costs of approximately  million associated with a  decrease in solid waste revenues of  service costs as a percentage of service revenues were  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   the decrease in margin is due to a reduced utilization of equipment and manpower as a result of the significant reduction in service revenue in  we saw a significant decrease in equipment and manpower utilization as a result of a significant decrease in revenue in  product costs as a percentage of product revenues was  in  compared to  in  the change is not significant but is primarily due to recurring product sales that typically have lower margins than the normal onetime long term projects that have higher margins solid waste costs were  million in  and  in  the decrease is primarily due to two factors  no sales of coronalux ™ units in  and  an increase in personnel to support the placement and operation of coronalux ™ units with customer along with product development and product enhancement activities sga expense decreased from approximately  million for the year ended december   to approximately  million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately  million the decrease in  compared to  was primarily due to  a decrease of professional fees of  million rent of  million marketing of  million salaries of  million share compensation of  million subcontractors and fuel of  million research and development of  million and an increase in insurance of  million and bad debts of  million the slight decrease in salaries and wages in  was due to a reduction on corporate support staff we impaired in  our idle coronalux ™ units in the amount of  our other long term asset related to sterall in the amount of  see note  and accrued a litigation settlement in the amount of  including the related legal fees total nonoperating other income expense net was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   the increase in  compared to  is primarily due to i an increase in interest expense of  as a result of an increase in convertible debt and shortterm debt in  ii a decrease of  in gain in settlement of debt from    there is no provision for income taxes for both the year ended december   and  due to our net losses for both periods   net loss before noncontrolling interest for the year ended december   was  million compared to a net loss before noncontrolling interest of  million for the year ended december   the net loss attributable to seer after deducting  for the noncontrolling interest was  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million after deducting  in noncontrolling interest for the year ended december   as noted above the  decrease in revenue in  compared to  coupled with the other expenses incurred during  was the primary reason for the increase in the net loss   changes in cash flow   operating activities   net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december   was  compared to  during the year ended december   cash used in operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments primarily include depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and intangible assets stock based compensation expense and in  asset impairment expense in  net noncash adjustments totaled approximately  million and in  net noncash adjustments totaled  in  the net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in cash by approximately  million primarily due to the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  million an increase of  in billings in excess of revenue on uncompleted contracts offset by an increase of  in accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets of  the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the timing of invoicing on client contracts the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in  was primarily increases in vendor payables due to the significant increase in environmental solutions revenue in  in  the net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in cash by approximately  million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of  million and the decrease in fixed assets from the sale of  coronalux™ units for  in  other changes in operating assets and liabilities offset each other resulting in no significant change in cash           investing activities   net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures our net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   in  we had addition to property and equipment of  increases in intangible assets of  and received  of insurance proceeds   financing activities   net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for  and  for  proceeds from the sale of common stock and exercise and extension of warrants was  and  in  and  respectively proceeds from the issuance of convertible and shortterm debt was  and  in  and  respectively payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations was  in  and  in  and payments on related party notes payable was  in  and  in    overall our cash changed very minimally from  to  primarily due to our net loss from operations offset by lower capital expenditures sale of common stock and exercise and extension of warrants and debt financing in  that provided some working capital to offset our operating losses   critical accounting policies judgments and estimates   use of estimates   the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of intangible assets valuation allowances and reserves for receivables inventory and deferred income taxes revenue recognition related to contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method sharebased compensation and loss contingencies including those related to litigation actual results could differ from those estimates   accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk   accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts and do not bear interest the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable historical experience and management judgment accounts receivable balances are reviewed individually for collectability and balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that the potential for recovery is remote an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  and  had been reserved as of december   and  respectively   we are exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business primarily related to accounts receivable our customers operate primarily in the oil production and refining rail transport biogas generating and wastewater treatment industries in the united states accordingly we are affected by the economic conditions in these industries as well as general economic conditions in the united states to limit credit risk management periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   and  we do not believe that we have significant credit risk   fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amounts of our financial instruments including accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost which approximates their fair value due to their shortterm maturities we believe that the carrying value of notes payable with third parties including their current portion approximate their fair value as those instruments carry market interest rates based on our current financial condition and liquidity we believe the amounts due to related parties also approximate their fair value as their carried interest rates are consistent with those of our notes payable with third parties          longlived assets   we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable an asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows for the year ended december   the company recognized an impairment to five coronalux ™ units of  no impairment was determined as of december     revenue recognition   we recognize revenue related to contract projects and services when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an agreement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured our revenue is primarily comprised of services related to industrial cleaning and railcar cleaning which we recognize as services are rendered   product revenue generated from projects which include the manufacturing of products for removal and treatment of hazardous vapor and gasses is accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method for projects with durations in excess of three months and the completedcontract method for all other projects total estimated revenue includes all of the following  the basic contract price  contract options and  change orders once contract performance is underway we may experience changes in conditions client requirements specifications designs materials and expectations regarding the period of performance such changes are “change orders” and may be initiated by us or by our clients in many cases agreement with the client as to the terms of change orders is reached prior to work commencing however sometimes circumstances require that work progress without obtaining client agreement revenue related to change orders is recognized as costs are incurred if it is probable that costs will be recovered by changing the contract price the company does not incur precontract costs under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize revenue primarily based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses are identified and included as additional loss provisions for estimated losses on contracts are shown separately as liabilities on the balance sheet if significant except in circumstances in which related costs are accumulated on the balance sheet in which case the provisions are deducted from the accumulated costs a provision as a liability is reported as a current liability   for contracts accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method we include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction contracts realizable and payable costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent the excess of contract costs and profits recognized to date over billings to date and are recognized as a current asset billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits recognized to date and are recognized as a current liability   the company’s revenues from waste destruction licensing agreements are recognized as a single accounting unit over the term of the license  in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc”  for revenues which contain multiple deliverables the company separates the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria i the delivered items have a standalone value to the customer ii the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined and iii if the arrangement includes a general right of return delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller  deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting unit  revenue from each accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature primarily asc    the company has fiveyear agreements with three companies in which the company amortizes various fees on a straightline basis over the initial fiveyear term of the agreement          stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation over the service period that they are expected to vest we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated value of the portion of a stockbased award that is ultimately expected to vest taking into consideration estimated forfeitures is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised   recently issued accounting pronouncements   changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap are established by the financial accounting standards board fasb in the form of accounting standards updates asu’s to the fasb’s accounting standards codification the company considers the applicability and impact of all new or revised asu’s   new

provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period” “asu ” current us gaap does not contain explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a nonvesting condition that affects the grantdate fair value of an award the new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grantdate fair value of the award the updated guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period the adoption of this asu did not have any impact on the company’s consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations   in april  the fasb issued asu  “simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs” “asu ” asu  requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts asu  is effective for the first interim period for fiscal years beginning after december   the adoption of this asu did not have any impact on the company’s consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations   in july  the fasb issued asu  “simplifying the measurement of inventory” under this asu inventory will be measured at the “lower of cost and net realizable value” and options that currently exist for “market value” will be eliminated the asu defines net realizable value as the “estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation” no other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement asu  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   management is evaluating the provisions of this statement and has not determined what impact the adoption of asu  will have on the company’s financial position or results of operations          in september  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no  “simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” the new guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination under the asu the

consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations   in november  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” the new guidance eliminates the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts the amendments will require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those annual periods the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance   in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  financial

entities generally be measured at fair value through earnings and ii when the fair value option has been elected for financial liabilities changes in fair value due to instrumentspecific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income additionally the asu  changes the disclosure requirements for financial instruments the new standard will be effective for the company starting in the first quarter of fiscal  early adoption is permitted for certain provisions the company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as whether to adopt certain provisions early   in february  the fasb issued new guidance related to leases that outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model and supersedes the current lease guidance the new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets for all leases with lease terms of great than  months it also

going concern continued   realization of a major portion of our assets as of december   is dependent upon our continued operations the company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable the company opened two additional rail car cleaning facilities one in the midwest illinois and one on the east coast maryland during  that began to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the oil refinery sector for the year ended december   we raised  in convertible debt financing and we raised  from the sale of common stock and exercise and extension of common stock warrants in addition we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern we continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing aggressive cost management and overhead reductions critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell permit and operate though our joint ventures and licensees our coronalux™ waste destruction units we have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding markets attributable to increased interest in energy conservation and emission control regulations in addition the company is evaluating various forms of financing which may be available to it there can be no assurance that the company will secure additional financing for working capital increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years these financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the company be unable to report on a going concern basis   note   summary of significant accounting policies   reclassifications   certain reclassifications have been made in the  consolidated financial statements to conform to the  presentation   use of estimates   the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the cash flows used in the impairment testing of definite lived tangible and intangible assets valuation allowances and reserves for receivables revenue recognition related to contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method and sharebased compensation actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   we consider all highly liquid debt investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents periodically we maintain deposits in financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits the company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents as of december   and  we did not hold any assets that would be deemed to be cash equivalents   f        strategic environmental  energy resources inc notes to consolidated financial statements   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk   accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable historical experience and management judgment accounts receivable balances are periodically reviewed for collectability and balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that the potential for recovery is remote an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  and  had been reserved as of december   and  respectively   we are exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business primarily related to accounts receivable our customers operate primarily in the oil production and refining rail transport biogas generating landfill and wastewater treatment industries in the united states accordingly we are affected by the economic conditions in these industries as well as general economic conditions in the united states to limit credit risk management periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   we do not believe that we have significant credit risk   as of december   we had no one customer who comprised  or more of our accounts receivable as of december   we had one customer who comprised  of our accounts receivable   for the year ended december   and  we had one customer with sales in excess of  of our revenue and they represented approximately  and  of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively the loss of this customer or a material reduction in revenue from this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business our results of operations and our working capital in early  we were notified by this significant customer that effective april   we would no longer be providing routine maintenance services but still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services during  the loss of revenue from this customer was approximately  million   inventories   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and maintained on a first in first out basis   vendor concentration   the company does not have any purchases from any one vendor comprising more that  of total purchases for  and  the company does not believe it is substantially dependent upon nor exposed to any significant concentration risk related to purchases from any single vendor   fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amounts of our financial instruments including accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost which approximates their fair value due to their shortterm maturities we believe that the carrying value of notes payable with third parties including their current portion approximate their fair value as those instruments carry market interest rates based on our current financial condition and liquidity we believe the amounts due to related parties also approximate their fair value as their carried interest rates are consistent with those of our notes payable with third parties   f        strategic environmental  energy resources inc notes to consolidated financial statements   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   fair value   as defined in authoritative guidance fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date “exit price” to estimate fair value the company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable   the authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities “level ” measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs “level ” measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level   observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities   level   other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs which are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability   level   unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which the company makes its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities   in instances in which multiple levels of inputs are used to measure fair value hierarchy classification is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability   property and equipment   property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation expenditures for replacements renewals and betterments are capitalized repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred   depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of generally five to seven years for equipment five to ten years for vehicles and three years for computer related assets assets are depreciated starting at the time they are placed into service a portion of depreciation expense is charged to cost of product revenue on the consolidated statement of operations   leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods which range from three to seven years or their estimated useful life   intangible assets   intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their respective estimated useful lives verses their estimated residual values and are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable we conduct our annual impairment test on december  of each year the company has evaluated its intangibles for impairment and has determined that no impairment was necessary as of december   no impairment was necessary as of december     f        strategic environmental  energy resources inc notes to consolidated financial statements   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   impairment of longlived assets   we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable further testing of specific assets or grouping of assets is required when undiscounted future cash flows associated with the assets is less than their carrying amounts an asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows no impairment was necessary as of december   however as of december   the company determined an impairment to five coronalux ™ units of  incurred due to lack of sale or license of the five units for a period of more than  months since completion of the units   revenue recognition   we recognize revenue related to contract projects and services when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an agreement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured our revenue is primarily comprised of services related to industrial cleaning and railcar cleaning which we recognize as services are rendered   product revenue generated from projects which include the manufacturing of products for removal and treatment of hazardous vapor and gasses is accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method for projects with durations in excess of three months and the completedcontract method for all other projects total estimated revenue includes all of the following  the basic contract price  contract options and  change orders once contract performance is underway we may experience changes in conditions client requirements specifications designs materials and expectations regarding the period of performance such changes are “change orders” and may be initiated by us or by our clients in many cases agreement with the client as to the terms of change orders is reached prior to work commencing however sometimes circumstances require that work progress without obtaining client agreement revenue related to change orders is recognized as costs are incurred if it is probable that costs will be recovered by changing the contract price the company does not incur precontract costs under the percentageofcompletion method we recognize revenue primarily based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses are identified and included as additional loss provisions for estimated losses on contracts are shown separately as liabilities on the balance sheet if significant except in circumstances in which related costs are accumulated on the balance sheet in which case the provisions are deducted from the accumulated costs a provision as a liability is reported as a current liability   for contracts accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method we include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction contracts realizable and payable costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent the excess of contract costs and profits recognized to date over billings to date and are recognized as a current asset billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits recognized to date and are recognized as a current liability   the company’s revenues from waste destruction licensing agreements are recognized as a single accounting unit over the term of the license  in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc”  for revenues which contain multiple deliverables the company separates the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria i the delivered items have a standalone value to the customer ii the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined and iii if the arrangement includes a general right of return delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller  deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting unit  revenue from each accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature primarily asc    f        strategic environmental  energy resources inc notes to consolidated financial statements   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   the company has fiveyear agreements with three companies in which the company amortizes various fees on a straightline basis over the initial fiveyear term of the agreement   stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation over the service period that they are expected to vest we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants using the blackscholes option pricing model the estimated value of the portion of a stockbased award that is ultimately expected to vest taking into consideration estimated forfeitures is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised   research and development   research and development “rd” costs are charged to expense as incurred and are included in selling general and administrative costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations rd expenses consist primarily of salaries project materials contract labor and other costs associated with ongoing product development and enhancement efforts rd expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively r  d expenses are included in general and administrative expenses   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification “asc”  income taxes which utilizes the asset and liability method of computing deferred income taxes the objective of this method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for any temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company’s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled   asc  also provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements tax positions must meet a “morelikelythannot” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized during the years ended december   and  the company recognized no adjustments for uncertain tax positions   the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense no interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were recognized at december   and  the company expects no material changes to unrecognized tax positions within the next twelve months   the company has filed federal and state tax returns through december   the tax periods for the years ending december   through  are open to examination by federal and state authorities   recently issued accounting pronouncements   changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap are established by the financial accounting

revenue accounting principles with a concurrently issued international financial reporting standards with previously differing treatment between united states practice and those of much of the rest of the world as well as to enhance disclosures related to disaggregated revenue information  the updated guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those annual periods on july   the fasb approved a one year delay of the effective date the company will now adopt the new provisions of this accounting standard at the beginning of

performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period” “asu ” current us gaap does not contain explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a nonvesting condition that affects the grantdate fair value of an award the new guidance requires that a performance

option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire the company estimated a volatility factor utilizing a weighted average of comparable published volatilities the company applied the simplified method to determine the expected term of grants the risk free interest rate is based on or approximates the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the

grew  year over year to  million from  million more than offsetting a decrease in product revenue from  million to  million for the comparative first quarters services revenue includes industrial and rail car cleaning services performed by the companys regs and tactical cleaning subsidiaries both of which carried growth momentum from  into the first quarter of  product revenue which is comprised of air quality fugitive emissions and renewable fuel solutions provided by the companys mv technologies subsidiary declined primarily due to timing issues involving project revenue recognition mv is however expected to show solid growth in  over  paragon waste solutions continues to win new business and is expected to begin contributing more significantly to revenue as its coronalux™ systems are placed into service later this yearseer continued to implement its aggressive growth initiatives during the first quarter and as a result total operating expenses increased to  million from  million

several operating locations our environmental and industrial services businesses performed very well growing revenue by  this growth more than offset lower product revenue from our mv technologies division we saw this coming since mv uses a project revenue recognition model based on percent of completion accounting and revenue can vary on a quartertoquarter basis independent of new orders and cash received in the first quarter we attended several industry conferences and saw increased interest in mvs products for odor control fugitive emissions management and renewable fuels so we are confident this level of activity combined with mvs existing project pipeline will position the business for solid fullyear revenue growth in we are also pleased that seers paragon waste solutions business continued to secure prepaid customer commitments for its coronalux™ waste destruction systems combs added in the first quarter approximately  of cash from these customers was received but deferred and will be amortized under our accounting practices seer invested approximately  million in the manufacture of coronalux™ systems during the first quarter and now has a total of five units
