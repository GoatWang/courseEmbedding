before or after the date hereof and regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings except to the extent expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing   cautionary statement regarding financial and operating data   the company cautions investors and potential investors not to place undue reliance upon the information contained in the monthly operating reports which was not prepared for the purpose of providing the basis for an investment decision relating to any of the securities of the company the company cannot predict what the ultimate value of any of its securities may be and it remains too early to determine whether holders of any such securities will receive any distribution in the debtors’ reorganization in particular in most cases under chapter  of the bankruptcy code holders of equity securities receive little or no recovery of value from their investment the monthly operating reports are limited in scope cover a limited time period and have been prepared solely for the purpose of complying with the monthly reporting requirements of the bankruptcy court the monthly operating reports were not audited or reviewed by independent accountants are in a format prescribed by applicable bankruptcy laws and regulations and are subject to future adjustment and reconciliation therefore the monthly operating reports do not necessarily contain all information required in filings pursuant to the exchange act or may present such information differently from such requirements there can be no assurance that from the perspective of an investor or potential investor in the debtors’ securities the monthly operating reports are complete the monthly operating reports also contain information for periods which are shorter or otherwise different from those required in the company’s reports pursuant to the exchange act and such information might not be indicative of the company’s financial condition or operating results for the period that would be reflected in the company’s financial statements or in its reports pursuant to the exchange act results set forth in the monthly operating reports should not be viewed as indicative of future results         cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements   this form k accompanying exhibits and other statements that we may make contain forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are statements that are not historical facts and include statements about our expectations for the timing and execution of our restructuring plan our future financial condition and future business plans and expectations the effect of and our expectations with respect to the operation of our business adequacy of financial resources and commitments and operating expectations during the pendency of our court proceedings such forwardlooking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management but are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results andor the timing of events to differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements including among others we filed for protection under chapter  of the united states bankruptcy code and are subject to risks and uncertainties operating under chapter  may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies our employees face considerable uncertainty due to the chapter  proceedings we may suffer from a protracted restructuring our ability to emerge from chapter  and operate profitably thereafter will depend on increasing our revenue lowering our costs and obtaining sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully we have substantial liquidity needs and due to our current chapter  proceedings may not be able to obtain any equity or debt financings in the capital market for the foreseeable future we may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the chapter  proceedings our restructuring efforts through the chapter  proceedings may be expensive take resources and distract management we are in the process of rejecting and abandoning a significant portion of our helicopter fleet through the chapter  proceedings which may result in an inability to quickly respond to new opportunities and a significant loss of market share and profit margins our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern our independent registered public accounting firm has raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern and we have not included any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty we have a history of net losses our substantial level of indebtedness operating lease commitments purchase and other commitments could materially adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under our debt agreements our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs all flights with the aircraft type h and as l have been temporarily grounded which may cause a material and adverse impact to our financial viability operating helicopters involves a degree of inherent risk and we are exposed to the risk of losses from safety incidents if we are unable to mitigate potential losses through a robust safety management and insurance coverage program our financial condition would be jeopardized in the event of a safety or other hazardous incident failure to maintain standards of acceptable safety performance could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and could adversely impact our reputation operations and financial performance our operations are largely dependent upon the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry the oil and gas industries on which we are largely dependent are suffering through a severe downturn resulting in significant negative impact on demand for our services and no assurance can be given that the downturn will not continue to be prolonged many of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and if we are unable to effectively compete it may result in a loss of market share or a decrease in revenue or profit margins we rely on a limited number of large offshore helicopter support contracts with a limited number of customers if any of these are terminated early or not renewed our revenues could decline negative publicity may adversely impact us our fixed operating expenses and longterm contracts with customers could adversely affect our business under certain circumstances we depend on a small number of helicopter manufacturers and any safety issues can severely limit our ability to continue operating helicopters already in our fleet we depend on a limited number of thirdparty suppliers for helicopter parts and subcontract services restructuring of our operations and organizational structure may lead to significant costs our business requires substantial capital expenditures lease and working capital financing which we are currently blocked from accessing through the capital markets and banks any further deterioration of current industry or business conditions the capital and banking markets or a prolonged period in chapter  proceedings generally could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations we rely on the secondary used helicopter market to dispose of our older helicopters and parts due to our ongoing fleet modernization efforts our operations are subject to extensive regulations which could increase our costs and adversely affect us our mro business helione could suffer if licenses issued by oems andor governmental authorities are not renewed or we cannot obtain additional licenses we derive significant revenue from nonwholly owned variable interest entities if we are unable to maintain good relations with the other owners of such nonwholly owned entities our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected our operations may suffer due to political regulatory commercial and economic uncertainty our business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increases the compliance risks associated with our international activities we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws rules regulations and ordinances that could have an adverse impact on our business we are subject to many different forms of taxation in various jurisdictions throughout the world which could lead to disagreements with tax authorities regarding the application of tax laws the offshore helicopter services industry is cyclical we are exposed to foreign currency risks our failure to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates effectively could unfavorably affect our financial performance we are exposed to credit risks our customers may seek to shift risk to us if oil and gas companies undertake cost reduction methods there may be an adverse effect on our business reductions in spending on helicopter services by government agencies could lead to modifications of sar and ems contract terms or delays in receiving payments which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations failure to develop or implement new technologies and disruption to our systems could affect our results of operations we rely on information technology and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively affected the loss of key personnel could affect our growth and future success labor problems could adversely affect us if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we could be required to make substantial cash contributions and our liquidity could be adversely affected adverse results of legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the event we are or become treated as a passive foreign investment company or pfic for us federal income tax purposes our us shareholders could be subject to adverse us federal income tax consequences we are controlled by a shareholder group which might have interests that conflict with ours or the interests of our other shareholders due to our chapter  bankruptcy proceedings our ordinary shares may have no value and any investment in our shares is highly speculative the market for our ordinary shares historically has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations we have not paid dividends on our ordinary shares historically and may not pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares or preferred shares for the foreseeable future pursuant to the terms of the preferred shares which rank senior to our ordinary shares we are required to pay regular cash dividends or issue shares in respect of amounts accrued as dividends on the preferred shares and we may be required under certain circumstances to repurchase the preferred shares we are currently unable to pay such obligations while we are in chapter  proceedings and are likely not to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future our preferred shares have rights preferences and privileges that are not held by and are preferential to the rights of holders of our ordinary shares such preferential rights could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and may result in the interests of the holders of our preferred shares differing from those of the holders of our ordinary shares we are a holding company and accordingly are dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management provisions of our articles of association and cayman islands corporate law may discourage or prevent an acquisition of us which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares our organizational documents contain a variety of antitakeover provisions that could delay deter or prevent a change in control shareholder rights under cayman islands law may differ materially from shareholder rights in the united states which could adversely affect the ability of us and our shareholders to protect our and their interests as a shareholder you might have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands and our major investors clayton dubilier  rice and first reserve management lp may compete with us and our articles of association contain a provision that expressly permits our nonemployee directors to compete with us and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including the company’s annual report on form k as amended for the year ended april   the company’s filings with the securities and exchange commission are available at wwwsecgov you are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forwardlooking statements herein and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements which are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement the forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update such forwardlooking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances no assurances can be given that our efforts to effectively reorganize under chapter  of the bankruptcy code will ultimately be successful or that we will succeed in strengthening our balance sheet or increase our financial flexibility

value for oneoff termination costs associated with an exit or disposal activity in accordance with asc  exit or disposal cost obligations the debtors recognize a liability for excess helicopter operating lease obligations when the debtors cease using the helicopter permanently in operations the liability is measured at fair value based on the remaining lease rentals including any contractually required costs including maintenance adjusted for the effects of any prepaid or deferred items recognized under the lease this liability is further reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the helicopter even if the debtors do not intend to enter to a sublease  at the inception of an operating lease where the debtors have guaranteed a portion of the helicopter residual values at the end of the lease term a liability is recognized with a corresponding prepaid rent asset that represents the fair value of the guaranteed helicopter residual the
