officer to find out more about the western asset macro opportunities fund talk to your financial advisor learn more about how to invest with legg mason  what i should know before investing the funds investment strategies and portfolio investments differ from those of many other mutual funds the manager may devote a significant portion of the funds assets to pursuing an investment opportunity or strategy including through the use of derivatives that create a form of investment leverage in the fund this approach to investing may make the fund a more volatile investment than other mutual funds and cause the fund to perform less favorably than other mutual funds under similar market or economic conditions  the fund makes significant use of derivatives for both hedging and nonhedging purposes which could result in substantial losses and greater volatility in the funds performance  fixedincome securities involve interest rate credit inflation and reinvestment risks and possible loss of principal as interest rates rise the value of fixedincome securities falls high yield bonds are subject to greater price volatility illiquidity and possibility of default international investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations and social economic and political uncertainties which could increase volatility these risks are magnified in emerging markets assetbacked mortgagebacked or mortgagerelated securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks potential active and frequent trading may result in higher transaction costs and increased investor liability the manager’s investment style may become out of favor andor the manager’s selection process may prove incorrect which may have a negative impact on the fund’s performance as a nondiversified fund it is permitted to invest a higher percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund which may magnify the fund’s losses from events affecting a particular issuer fund facts

additional information an investor cannot invest directly in an index unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees expenses or sales charges net asset value nav an investment option’s net asset value “nav” per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding  effective june   the fund changed its security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices of underlying fund holdings to calculate the nav funds may show a onetime increase of the nav which is due to this change in pricing methodology

centrepoint ken leech photographed in an alley in whitechapel photo frank baron for the guardian pm bst  sep  comments the reverend kenneth leech who has died aged  was unique among the anglican clergy of his generation in combining orthodox christian faith high churchmanship a deep spirituality radical socialism and unwavering commitment to the welfare of the underprivileged – mainly in london’s east end he was also a prolific writer there was nothing trendy or superficial about this he strongly opposed the liberal theology originating in the s and the more recent outburst of evangelicalism he was a profound thinker and believed that only the inherited catholic doctrine of the incarnation and its sacramental consequences could sustain a christian involvement in political and social action “subversive orthodoxy” was his own description of his position he believed that “an alliance between prophetic christianity and progressive marxism” offered “the last human hope of mankind” for him new labour came nowhere near to providing such a hope and he said that while there was overwhelming evidence of tony blair’s faith there was no evidence of his socialism in some ways leech was a throwback to the thcentury anglocatholic priests who ministered heroically in the slums of east london and other cities and became politically radical he acknowledged their inspiration but denied a romantic attachment to their example and was in fact driven by powerful intellectual forces an enduring monument to his work is centrepoint which he founded as a soho curate in  to help homeless young people who had migrated to london the princess of wales was its first patron it is now a national charity and has so far helped over  young people the reverend kenneth leech  photo st chrysostom’s church kenneth leech was born in ashtonunderlyne in greater manchester on june   his workingclass parents had no church connections but as a teenager he attended an anglocatholic church in nearby hyde the turning point came in  when he went to manchester’s free trade hall to hear father trevor huddleston recently returned from his epic witness against apartheid in south africa this convinced him of the unbreakable link between christian faith and social action and drove him in the direction of holy orders in  he went to king’s college london to read modern history and during this time lived with a franciscan community in cable street in the east end of london where victorian slums remained and the friars were exercising a ministry to prostitutes he soon became aware of wider social needs leech next went to trinity college oxford to read theology and completed his ordination training at st stephen’s house a curacy at holy trinity hoxton from  to  took him back to east london and to a neocatholic church where the tradition of ministry to the poorest continued this led to a move to st anne’s soho and what he called a “loitering ministry” on streets where social problems of many sorts abounded the foundation of the soho drugs group and centrepoint were his response after four years he became chaplain and tutor at st augustine’s theological college canterbury where he was able to share his experience and ideas with a new generation of ordinands and wrote youthquake  this was designed to alert the churches to the radical changes taking place in youth culture and the rise in drug abuse it was also widely read in the field of social work the reverend kenneth leech in younger days  photo st chrysostom’s church in  leech returned to parish ministry as rector of st matthew’s bethnal green where the challenge now was the existence of the harassed bangladeshi and bengali communities in and around brick lane during the next six years he closely identified himself with their life and came to be regarded by them as a friend and spokesman at the same time he was involved in protest marches and demonstrations against the national front and other extreme rightwing organisations he also founded in  the jubilee group which became a national network promoting the cause of what he called “sacramental socialism” when a manifesto was needed he turned for assistance to rowan williams at that time an oxford college chaplain the future archbishop of canterbury became an enthusiastic member for the next  years the group folded in  and leech was one of its few members who supported the cause of women priests in  he joined the staff of the british council of churches and then of the general synod’s board of social responsibility as a field work officer he was also a curate in notting hill an area which still had many race and poverty problems he then spent three years from  to  as director of the runnymede trust concerned nationally with the promotion of ethnic and racial harmony he commented often critically on government policies and travelled widely including in north america to give lectures from  until his retirement in  leech was an honorary curate of st botolph’s aldgate on the border between the city and fastchanging whitechapel as a “community theologian” financed by the christendom trust he believed that true theology is produced not in the ivory towers of academia but on the streets where christian thinkers engage with human life and need for leech this involved close identification with the muslim community as well as others “living outside the gates of affluent british life and the churches” in doing theology in altab ali park  he provided a stimulating challenging account of his project a quietly spoken somewhat shy man leech could have never been mistaken for anything other than a priest there was a deeply spiritual contemplative element in his character that sustained his demanding ministry and attracted others for counselling and help with prayer his publications soul friend  true prayer  and the eye of the storm spiritual resources for the pursuit of justice which won the  harper collins religious book prize were widely read he neither expected nor received any preferment in the church and in the s said that bishops were “state nominees charming and pleasant but bear the marks of the beast” he was however awarded a lambeth dd by archbishop rowan williams he is survived by his wife julie and by a son from a previous marriage the rev kenneth leech born june   died
