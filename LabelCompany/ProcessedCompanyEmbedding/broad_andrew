business but for those who do moving from branded product to brand platform is one way to add value andrew whitman managing partner at x consumer products growth partners talked about the process of what he called – and trademarked as – “brand platformation” and the benefits and challenges that come with creating that kind of broad product suite during a presentation at nosh live in new york last month when deciding the ways a brand can form a broader business platform or variety of product types whitman said “it always always always starts and ends with the consumer” he advised businesses to consider packaging ingredients technology and distribution as well as determining which potential pillar means the most to customers for flaxmilk and yogurt maker good karma a x consumer products growth portfolio company it was the “amazing nutrient profile” of flax seed that allowed the brand to build an alluring platform which ultimately led to an investment by dean foods “they were hyperfocused on their consumer and where their supply chain was” whitman said “so then good karma wasn’t just our name but became inspiration for everything we do that messaging led to our portfolio expansion” while whitman noted that platforming a brand can make it more valuable for brands to see that return “the devil’s in the details” platforming without catering to those details whitman said can be potentially harmful “platforming is not something you would do on day one and a matter of fact if you do it too early it will be the death of your business” he said “just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should” watch below to see whitman’s complete presentation top news nosh voices disruptive cultured food at the daily table press clips herbicide traces found in ben  jerry’s
