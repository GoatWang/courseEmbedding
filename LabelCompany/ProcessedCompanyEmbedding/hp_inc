incs new product lineup is spoton  the motley fool skip to main content the motley fool foolcom foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why hp incs new product lineup is spoton like other tech giants the pc leader unveiled a host of new products at ces  with one underlying theme tim brugger timbrugger jan   at pm hp nysehpq enjoyed nearly unanimous positive industry reviews surrounding its slew of new or upgraded devices released at the recent consumer electronics show ces while the multiple devices wowed at ces it could be argued that hps approach to product sales as much as the products themselves is whats driving its success in the pc market taking that a step further the same tack hp so clearly exhibited at ces should turn its printing fortunes around as well image source hp introductions are in order hp unveiled five upgraded products recently beginning with its elitebook x unit billed as the worlds thinnest convertible the elitebook x is designed for mobile business users with a battery life of over  hours and a focus on facilitating online conferencing next up is the improved hp spectre x one theme throughout ces was that hp doesnt just invite customer feedback it implements it as it did with spectre x nearly twothirds of laptop customers said they preferred inch displays and  wanted ultrahigh definition so hps spectre x now delivers both its screen size is  inches up from  and features longtime partner nvidias nasdaq nvda highly touted new geforce graphics chip and theres more the enhanced hp envy offers immersive media fans an even wider curved screen now boasting a inch display and an integrated fourspeaker sound bar sure the envy is a pc but its a device with the worlds video streamers youtube fanatics and digital photographers in mind along with enough power and goodies to satisfy those in need of a pc hp likely hit a home run with its first omen  which also comes with nvidias highend geforce graphic capabilities  in the fastgrowing virtual reality vr market particularly among gamers and the fact it now comes with a whopping inch curved screen should have the gaming crowd applauding finally theres the improved sprout pro g that was initially designed for consumers however sprouts combination of pc scanning d and overhead projector features has proved to be a hit in the classroom and its full redesign is aimed at schools and businesses the revamped sprout pro g is smaller to fit on a teachers desktop and has better resolution for its projector along with other industryspecific improvements the common theme the underlying theme among hps upgraded product lineup is that each targets a specific market either by industry or usage requirements that said there is surely overlap into other opportunities hps vrready omen is an example as vr expands beyond gaming into social media its easy to imagine social fans designers and engineers considering omen as an alternative the targeting of specific markets via its devices and features isnt new though it is becoming more refined and the results are there to see the global pc sales race has narrowed to two current leader lenovo nasdaqothlnvgy and hp a year ago lenovo owned  of the global pc market a full  percentage points higher than hp as of s third quarter lenovos margin over hp had shrunk to just half a percentage point   for lenovo and  for hp  thanks to its target marketing and development strategy as hp demonstrated at ce its not just sticking to the plan its enhancing it which is why hp will likely soon be the top pc seller in the world and with its  dividend yield hp stock warrants a good hard look from growth and income
