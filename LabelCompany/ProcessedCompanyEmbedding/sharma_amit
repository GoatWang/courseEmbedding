answers to these questions can help us understand how information diffuses through society support sharing of information in online social systems and create better recommendation systems i use online traces of human activity to make progress on these broad largely open questions i employ online experiments and data mining from a variety of domains such as entertainment ecommerce and collaborative

publications conference papers accounting for preference similarity when estimating social influence in online sharing networks amit sharma and dan cosley in submission to www  abstract pdf web abstract many online social networks thrive on automatic sharing of peoples activities to their friends and followers a fundamental question in the study of such online sharing networks is how exposure to their friends activities influences peoples future actions we consider a specific form of social influence mimicry or copying others actions and propose a test to estimate the extent of influence in a sharing network our test assumes that nonfriends are unlikely to exert any influence on a users actions and thus comparing the extent of correlation in activity of a user with her friends versus nonfriends can be used to separate the effect of social influence from personal preferences unlike past tests for influence from observational data our test relies only on available activity history of users and directly gives estimates of influence at both the individual and network level experiments on a dataset from lastfm show that the proposed test can rule out influence for a majority of friends activities that correlate with each other to verify whether these results extend to other sites we also applied our test to data from three other websites with preference data for books movies and photos we find while the fraction of correlated actions between friends that could have happened without influence varies influence estimates for all four websites fall into a narrow range  suggesting that only about one percent of the total user actions on such sharing networks can be attributed to social influence estimating the causal impact of recommender systems amit sharma jake hofman and duncan watts in submission to www  abstract pdf web abstract recommendation systems are an increasingly prominent part of the web accounting for up to a third of all traffic on several of the worlds most popular sites nevertheless little is known about how much activity such systems cause over and above what would occur if recommendations were absent from these sites although such questions about the causal impact of recommendations usually require costly experiments here we present a method for estimating these effects from purely observational data specifically we show that causal identification is possible when a product experiences an instantaneous shock in direct traffic and the products recommended next to it do not we then apply our method to browsing logs containing anonymized activity for  million users on amazoncom over an  month period and analyze over  unique products that experience such shocks we find that while  of all views on these products do indeed come from recommendation clickthroughs at least  of this activity would likely occur in the absence of recommendations we conclude with a discussion about the assumptions under which the method is appropriate and caveats around extrapolating results to other products sites or settings studying and modeling the connection between peoples preferences and content sharing amit sharma and dan cosley cscw  abstract pdf web abstract people regularly share items using online social media however peoples decisions around sharingwho shares what to whom and whyare not well understood we present a user study involving  pairs of facebook users to understand how people make their sharing decisions we find that even when sharing to a specific individual peoples own preference for an item individuation dominates over the recipients preferences altruism peoples openended responses about how they share however indicate that they do try to personalize shares based on the recipient to explain these contrasting results we propose a novel process model of sharing that takes into account peoples preferences and the salience of an item we also present encouraging results for a sharing prediction model that incorporates both the senders and the recipients preferences these results suggest improvements to both algorithms that support sharing in social media and to information diffusion models friends strangers and the value of ego networks for recommendation amit sharma mevlana gemici and dan cosley icwsm  abstract pdf web abstract two main approaches to using social network information in recommendation have emerged augmenting collaborative filtering with social data and algorithms that use only egocentric data we compare the two approaches using movie and music data from facebook and hashtag data from twitter we find that recommendation algorithms based only on friends perform no worse than those based on the full network even though they require much less data and computational resources further our evidence suggests that locality of preference or the nonrandom distribution of item preferences in a social network is a driving force behind the value of incorporating social network information into recommender algorithms when locality is high as in twitter data simple knn recommenders do better based only on friends than they do if they draw from the entire network these results help us understand when and why social network information is likely to support recommendation systems and show that systems that see egocentric slices of a complete network such as websites that use facebook logins or have computational limitations such as mobile devices may profitably use egocentric recommendation algorithms do social explanations work studying and modeling the effects of social explanations in recommender systems amit sharma and dan cosley www  abstract details pdf web abstract recommender systems associated with social networks often use social explanations eg xy and  friends like this to support the recommendations we present a study of the effects of these social explanations in a music recommendation context we start with an experiment with  users in which we show explanations with varying levels of social information and analyze their effect on users decisions we distinguish between two key decisions the likelihood of checking out the recommended artist and the actual rating of the artist once the user has listened to several songs we find that while the explanations do have some influence on the likelihood there is little correlation between the likelihood and actual listening rating for the same artist based on these insights we present a generative probabilistic model that explains the interplay between explanations and beckground information on music preferences and how that leads to a final likelihood rating for an artist acknowledging the impact of explanations we discuss a general recommendation framework that models external informational elements in the recommendation interface in addition to inherent preferences of users pairwise learning in recommendation experiments with pairwise recommendation on linkedin amit sharma and baoshi yan acm recsys  abstract details pdfslides abstract many online systems present a list of recommendations and infer user interests implicitly from clicks or other contextual actions for modeling user feedback in such settings a common approach is to consider items acted upon to be relevant to the user and irrelevant otherwise however clicking some but not others conveys an implicit ordering of the presented items pairwise learning which leverages such implicit ordering between a pair of items has been successful in areas such as search ranking in this work we study whether pairwise learning can improve community recommendation we first present two novel pairwise models adapted from logistic regression both offline and online experiments in a large realworld setting show that incorporating pairwise learning improves the recommendation performance however the improvement is only slight we find that users preferences regarding the kinds of communities they like can differ greatly which adversely affect the effectiveness of features derived from pairwise comparisons we therefore propose a probabilistic latent semantic indexing model for pairwise learning pairwise plsi which assumes a set of users latent preferences between pairs of items our experiments show favorable results for the pairwise plsi model and point to the potential of using pairwise learning for community recommendation algorithms for generating ordered solutions for explicit andor structures extended abstract priyankar ghosh amit sharma partha pratim chakrabarti and pallab dasgupta ijcai  abstract pdf abstract we present algorithms for generating alternative solutions for explicit acyclic andor structures in nondecreasing order of cost our algorithms use a best first search technique and report the solutions using an implicit representation ordered by cost experiments on randomly constructed andor dags and problem domains including matrix chain multiplication finding the secondary structure of rna etc show that the proposed algorithms per form favorably to the existing approach in terms of time and space networkcentric recommendation personalization with and in social networks amit sharma and dan cosley ieee socialcom  abstract pdf ieee abstract people often rely on the collective intelligence of their social network for making choices which in turn influences their preferences and decisions however traditional recommender systems largely ignore social context and even networkaware

recommendations and introduce popcore a platform for studying them in facebook an initial user study with popcore gives insights into tradeoffs around the popularity likeability and rateability of

explore the idea of networkcentric recommendations in contrast to individuallyoriented recommendations enabled by social network data a networkcentric approach to recommendations introduces new goals such as effective information exchange enabling shared experiences and supporting userinitiated suggestions in addition to conventional goals like recommendation accuracy we are building a facebook
