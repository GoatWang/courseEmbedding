plans expectations and assumptions regarding our future performance including discussing full year guidance these statements involve risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements for a discussion of these risks you should refer to the cautionary information about forwardlooking statements in our press release from yesterday the presentation posted to our website for this call and the risk factors section of our form k that we filed oh i guess about an hour ago that is posted to our website we will also discuss certain nongaap financial measures that we believe are useful in evaluating our performance reconciliation of those measures to the most directlycomparable gaap measures and other information about these nongaap metrics are also described in our earnings release from yesterday following the call today we will head up to vail for the credit suisse conference where we hope to see many of you we will also attend the simmons and raymond james conferences in the coming weeks and again hope to see many of you there speaking this morning will be jay ottoson president and chief operating sic executive  officer wade pursell executive vice president and chief financial officer and i am very pleased to introduce herb vogel our evp of operations who will cover certain operational accomplishments in  and how what we learned in  shapes our  plans as well as reserves in economic inventory herb is covering a lot of good information today so get out your notepads after the prepared remarks we may be timelimited for qa so in order to stay within an hour i ask you to limit your questions to one or two and with that i will turn the call over to jay javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director well thank you jennifer good morning thank you to everyone for calling in today well im going to address just right upfront what seems to be a key issue for people following our release last night we do expect our production volumes to be down sharply this quarter and down yearoveryear because in both our operated and nonoperated eagle ford programs discretionary capital was cut starting late last year we are transitioning to spending more in the permian because at current product prices our program in the permian generates better cashoncash returns and higher operating margins than our eagle ford programs our eagle ford volumes however are large and they decline rapidly when you first cut activity and it takes awhile for the permian volumes to kick in so overall you get a steep drop in production and then rate flattens out our overall operating margin per barrel should improve significantly as our black oil percentage of production rises which will have a positive impact on cash flows and on our debt leverage look i know the optics of this initially arent great but its the right thing to do in order to optimize cash flow and cash flow is the lifeblood of our business now there is no question that the macro is tough right now however we came into this downturn in a better position than most of our peers from a leverage and balance sheet standpoint and we believe we can maintain that advantage our strategic priorities are first to preserve liquidity secondly were going to persevere through this downturn without shareholder dilution and thirdly we believe we can continue to make progress in improving our well results and our project portfolio even here at the bottom of the cycle we strongly believe that we have both the capacity and the discipline to perform differentially for shareholders as prices begin to recover im now going to turn the call over to wade and herb so they can fill you in on the details of our  financial and operating plan wade a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks jay well good morning everyone well as jay said these are certainly very difficult times for us and i know for everyone on the phone this morning however i will say the fact that our stock is less than half of where it began this year and our bonds are trading below  seems to be implying something that i believe is simply not going to happen we continue to be steadfast in our plan to keep our debt metrics and liquidity in good standing while our operations team continues to drive value regardless of commodity prices so lets start with the balance sheet and capitalization structure on slide  im going to make four very important points this morning first and foremost liquidity nothing is more important in this environment we currently have a revolver with a  billion borrowing base and  billion commitment level only  million is drawn on the facility and our longterm plan keeps spending less than ebitdax generated ill make a quick comment on the upcoming spring redetermination we all expect borrowing bases to fall significantly as banks lower their price decks with respect to sm i can tell you that i think ours could fall below the  billion commitment level but not too far below that level so we will still have significant liquidity available to us second point maturities you can see from the slide that the earliest maturity on any of our bonds is  even our revolver does not mature until  so we are in very good shape there third point coverage levels those of you that have been following this for awhile know that we were disciplined in not levering the balance sheet during the highcommodity price years like a lot of our peers did because of that our debttoebitdax is currently only  times which compares very favorably with the peer average we currently have a covenant with the banks to maintain a level below four times i can tell you that our  business plan which ill walk through momentarily run at current strip pricing stays within this level and looking ahead to  we have a plan that stays below four times as well assuming oil prices average  and natural gas  these prices approximated a recent strip now while we believe prices will be at or above these levels in  we obviously will not bet the balance sheet on it accordingly weve already had discussions with our banks about changing this covenant to something we would be much more comfortable with should prices not recover were hoping to get this done in connection with the spring borrowing base redetermination so my fourth and final point on the balance sheet relates to the significant discount on the bonds and whether we would try to capture some of that by repurchasing them we obviously do the math and are very tempted by it the first thing i will repeat is theres nothing more important than liquidity right now extreme caution should be employed when using liquidity to retire very attractive longterm unsecured debt now you might ask why drill any wells right now why not just buy back bonds first of all youll note in our business plan discussion that we continue to reduce activity significantly and as you know investing some level of capital into drilling wells does support our longterm business and financing capacity continued drilling ensures that we meet our commitments to our lessors allows us to retain our substantial drilling inventory and better positions us for significant upside leverage to a price recovery with all that said i can tell you that we are exploring ways to take advantage of this opportunity but were not interested in hampering our liquidity or diluting shareholders particularly at these depressed levels so lets now move on to the  business plan so im on slide  capital expenditures are planned to be around  million which is aligned with projected ebitdax for this period this was a recent strip with averaged  for oil and  for natural gas this level of spending is down more than  from  as a result of low natural gas and ngl prices we plan to redirect capital from the natural gas condensate development in the eagle ford which we actually began slowing in the fourth quarter as jay mentioned to our oilfocused programs in the permian and williston basins that have favorable recycle ratios and returns at current commodity prices and service costs we will be completing a number of wells in our duc inventory you can see these projected levels on slide  as well as the rig count in each area throughout the year of note we plan to pick up a second rig in the permian beginning in the second quarter our permian position is the core of the core we believe our position there has tremendous upside value as we proveup additional zones and continue to refine our already bestinclass well performance the results of this activity is a capex split  permian about  divide county williston and about  eagle ford predominantly in the east we expect this plan to generate production of  million to  million barrels of oil equivalent for  with an increasing oil mix the oil percentage of fourth quarter  production was about  we expect this to increase to about  by the fourth quarter of  i mentioned earlier that we began to slow activity in the eagle ford during the fourth quarter again this is an intentional shift to the oilier assets driven by economics and liquidity preservation the result is a pretty steep decline in our forecast production for the first quarter of this year especially natural gas and ngls of note we have not connected any new wells in the eagle ford to sales since november  therefore were projecting first quarter  production of around  million to  million barrels of oil equivalent with production then remaining relatively flat the remainder of the year for  we have assumed a similar level of drilling activity generating relatively flat production and keeping capex under projected ebitdax we believe if prices do not materially recover by then costs will continue to fall another  or  in our estimation and we will likely make some further changes to our cost structure with respect to portfolio activity we plan to continue to coreup by divesting of various noncore acreage throughout the company just based on pdp value we anticipate at least  million of proceeds from these divestitures by the fourth quarter of this year with respect to our  production guidance we removed about  barrels of oil equivalent – and that was about  oil – from the fourth quarter related to these divestitures finally as a reminder on slide  we have substantial hedges in place at very favorable prices that help support our cash flows and liquidity position details of these are included in the appendix of this presentation and the k which was filed this morning so in the interest of time im not going to walk through the fourth quarter results which are summarized on slide  much of this was reported last month there are a lot of detailed schedules in the release and the ir materials with further detail in the k were happy to answer any questions regarding this material directly by phone so with that im going to turn the call over to herb vogel to discuss our yearend reserves and economic inventory and also to provide a little more color on the operations detail in the  plan herb herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations thank you wade and good morning everyone behind the metrics of the  plan that wade just discussed were doing a number of things operationally that are driving performance building drilling inventory and ultimately value simply stated we are continually delivering better wells at lower cost which are imperative in the current price environment during  our regional operations teams executed drilling and completion tests in each of our core areas that improved well performance and importantly significantly increased our view of viable inventory at fiveyear strip pricing this in turn is shaping our  plan to optimize returns from our capital program i will speak to overall inventory growth in a few minutes but let me first touch on some of these  accomplishments and what we learned and speak to how they feed the  plan im at slide  theres some headlines there about the eagle ford but in the interest of time im going to jump right to slide  and talk about our eagle ford pilot test where we made substantial progress in  executing on our pilot across the five pilots that have commenced production todate we have reached several general and in some cases preliminary conclusions that will drive our future plans first increasing sand loading to the  to  pound per lateral foot range substantially enhances well economics across the vast majority of our acreage the only exception todate is at the eastern end of our acreage position in galvan where the lower eagle ford is somewhat thinner and our older lower sand loading levels are appropriate and optimal second the upper eagle ford is productive across our acreage position we see very similar early production profiles in the upper and lower eagle ford in lower yield areas in higher yield areas we see room to optimize our completion design and land spacing  target in the upper eagle ford third tighter well spacing is viable with optimal spacing dependent on the pay thickness the configuration of wells across the upper and lower eagle ford and the condensate yields codevelopment at tighter spacing achieves stronger economic returns than later infill development given that we have some of the thickest rock across the entire eagle ford play we see potential for w or stackedstaggered configurations but need more production history from recent pilots to reach firm conclusions pilot  in particular gives us quite a bit of encouragement where we see the staggered or w configuration between both the upper eagle ford and the lower eagle ford on foot spacing resulting in wells as productive as our older lower eagle ford wells spaced at plus feet clearly we are very excited about the potential inventory additions from what weve seen todate fourth drilling well bores with a high percentage of the lateral in the optimal targeted facies matters much more than we previously recognized and became a key area of focus in  we are now approaching  of our lateral lengths being completed in the optimal target facies interval and this helps us develop the complex fracture networks that we seek to maximize the reservoir area contacted by our fracture stimulation fifth we evaluated many other completion optimization techniques such tighter stage spacing use of diverters use of lower fluid volumes tighter cluster spacing and different perforation clusters and will be incorporating what we have learned in future completion designs now let me touch on pilot  for a couple minutes the  wells in this pilot were all drilled with foot laterals at the north end of our briscoe ranch acreage we targeted facies  in the lower eagle ford and facies  and  in the upper eagle ford in a stackedstaggered configuration in some of the thickest eagle ford section in the entire play a gross thickness of almost  feet we aggressively and appropriately targeted drilling the wells at  feet laterally between wells in the same facies which would look like  feet between wells in a planned view the uppermost upper eagle ford facies  wells were targeted to be drilled directly above the lower eagle ford facies  well or roughly  to  feet apart vertically if successful and applicable broadly this pilot would more than triple our perceived inventory in the area so we were clearly shooting for a big inventory impact with this pilot now weve been flowing hydrocarbons from all  wells since midnovember so we have about three months of production data all naturally flowing with no artificial lift installed yet production todate from the four lower eagle ford wells have averaged right at our expected type curve for the area on a per thousand foot lateral basis todate we havent seen any interference here with the offset upper eagle ford wells early yields range from  barrels per million cubic feet to  barrels per million cubic feet with gas rates between  million cubic feet and  million cubic feet per day the good news is that these wells on foot spacing fit a floor at one times our inventory expectations for the area the wells drilled in the upper eagle ford facies  and  are not performing as well as the wells in the lower eagle ford some of these wells were drilled a bit closer to each other than planned and from the tracer surveys that we have run we can see that there has been crossflow between wells and that the stimulated rock volumes may have overlapped however looking at other places that we have completed in facie  we have now determined that facies  is a better target than facies  in the upper eagle ford early days but given the performance so far we see that there is potential of down spikes further in the lower eagle ford in this area and perhaps a staggered facies  and  configuration may be better up here in the north where condensate yields are higher looking across all the pilots we see the upper eagle ford working about equal to the lower eagle ford in the vast majority of our acreage to the south and east where tested at the north end of briscoe the lower eagle ford outperforms the upper eagle ford we should be able to work from here to customize and optimize our completion design in the upper eagle ford in the north and see whether we can do better on wells up there in short our extensive eagle ford tests have given us the confidence to significantly increase our drilling inventory relative to a year ago by over  in the eagle ford alone under identical fiveyear strip assumptions as last year this is a great asset with a lot of hydrocarbon in place well over  billion barrels equivalent on our  operated acres and many years of growth potential from a large inventory of future drilling location finally we have reduced the drill and complete cost of wells by over  from over  per lateral foot in mid to around  per lateral foot during fourth quarter  from a combination of service sector deflation and many efficiency improvements such as faster drilling and zipper fracking as shown in slide  we are clearly achieving better wells at lower costs in the eagle ford today during  we can meet our acreage commitments with less than one rig and one completions crew we have renegotiated our gas gathering and processing commitments and production can be maintained well above commitment levels at this drill and complete activity level given the high gas percentage of our eagle ford production and the current commodity price environment economics of new wells here are less attractive than the oily parts of our portfolio in the williston and permian basin recognizing balance sheet priorities and the current economics of drilling gassier plays less capital will be allocated to eagle ford in our  plan than previous years as a result we will complete and evaluate pilot tests that have been drilled todate at a slower pace and use the added time available to evaluate and further optimize completion design turning now to the williston basin in slide  in  we focused on incremental completion design improvements and testing and optimizing well performance across the significant acreage acquisitions that we closed in divide county during  ill just touch on a few notable advancements here first cemented plugandperforated completions have performed well delivering superior economics and higher eurs of the same sand loading levels as our previous swellpacker sliding sleeve design and have become our standard design as shown in slide  second tests of the bakken in divide county where we had previously focused solely on the three forks have yielded similar economics and eurs as the three forks in the locations we have tested todate this is another area where we have significantly increased our view of viable inventory at fiveyear strip pricing doubling our inventory by adding the bakken where we previously only accounted the three forks stacked pay also enables attractive economies of scale with two productive intervals theres more developable oil in place per section doubling up our ability to utilize infrastructures such as roads pads and sump  facilities thereby improving returns from wells drilled at both intervals and third weve been able to drive cost down to the  million level for a  foot lateral in divide county from a combination of efficiency gains and service cost reductions in slide  you can see that we have made progress improving returns in the current commodity price environment and expect to see further improvement for example we just negotiated new lower cost rig and completion contracts in december which will benefit the economics id like to point out one thing thats frequently overlooked about our position in divide county in comparison to bakken plays to the south in williams and mckenzie counties and that is that the bakken and three forks are at shallower depths in divide county this results in lower cost wells for the same lateral length in a target interval while the initial production rates are lower the decline rates are shallower this combination better wells by a shallower declines and lower costs leads to very competitive economics for  in the williston we can retain our prospective acreage with one rig and we have a substantial inventory of ducs that we will be completing and bringing on production we plan to run a slightly reduced program in  relative to  as cash payouts in the permian basin are somewhat faster turning now to the permian basin in slide  youre likely aware that our acreage in sweetie peck is held by production or hbp as a result we were able to dial back activity in  without losing acreage which enabled us to deploy capital to other regions where we had commitments and good returns this enabled us to focus on understanding production performance and completion design influence on the  plus new horizontal wells we completed at sweetie peck through february of  as peers began to report more of their well results in the midland basin we quickly realized that sweetie peck horizontal well production performance was truly extraordinary and among the best in the basin as shown in slide  the ips of our sweetie peck wolfcamp b wells really stand out this trend continued and became even more evident after about a year of production history as shown on slide  which confirmed that wolfcamp b wells in our acreage are some of the best in the basin as compared to results reported by other major operators in the basin in the slide we show actual sweetie peck well production performance normalized to a foot lateral length and compare the results published by other operators from the legend you can see some of the range of completion techniques we tested at sweetie peck our testing program at sweetie peck led us to conclude that longer laterals completed with a cemented plugandperf design a slick water fluid system higher sand loading zipper fracking and tighter cluster spacing all contributed to improved well performance or improved efficiencies while most of our horizontal wells targeted the wolfcamp b zone our lower spraberry wells are showing some promise that returns in this shallower zone will be equal to or better than wolfcamp b zone as a result of lower well costs coupled with shallower decline rate we started drilling and completion activity at sweetie peck again at the start of the year and have achieved drilling and completion costs over  lower than mid the completion design improvements which led to better wells coupled with the lower costs from efficiency gains and service sector deflation have materially improved the economics of wells at sweetie peck we are now able to achieve nearly  irrs at flat  per barrel oil prices with a foot lateral as shown with the lower spraberry example on slide  sweetie peck economics are the best in our portfolio and as a result our plan for  includes capex for redeploying an eagle ford rig to sweetie peck during april in addition to the rig which started operations there at the start of the year overall we view sweetie peck as a true tier  asset in the midland basin we have a contiguous acreage footprint with ownership of water and surface rights that enable particularly efficient and lowcost operations that yield outstanding margins our roughly  net acre position is comparable in size to diamondbacks spanish trail asset and has potential in five horizons and weve only tested two todate our  program will target the wolfcamp b and the lower spraberry in order to deliver the best proven returns on capital given the track record of our wells todate we have no doubt that our sweetie peck program will deliver industryleading returns in the midland basin ill now move on to reserves and economic inventory im on slide  theres several tables in the press release presentation and of course k providing backup data for our yearend proved reserves we ended the year with  million barrels equivalent which is down  from yearend  adjusted for the assets we sold during the year while price and fiveyear rule revisions slightly more than offset the positives the performance revisions and reserve additions through drilling are a testament to a successful  program despite the decline in commodity prices i will reiterate that production replacement from reserve additions and performance revisions was  and point to a few other highlights in slide  and in slide  you can see our solid track record of building our proved reserves with a compound annual growth rate in proved reserves of  over the past six years turning now to drilling inventory in slide  we started  with a number of pilot tests in the eagle ford and bakkenthree forks with a goal of doubling our economic inventory over the next few years at yearend  we had a drilling inventory of about  billion barrels from  net drilling locations in our operated eagle ford and bakkenthree forks programs this assessment assumed fiveyear average strip pricing as of yearend  or  barrel oil  gas  per barrel ngls and a  irr hurdle rate we believe that for evaluating multiyear inventory levels it is important to assess with a longerterm view hence the use of the fiveyear strip average applying these same prices and hurdle as used to calculate our drilling inventory at year end  the companys drilling inventory at the end of  increased by more than  to  million barrels equivalent or  billion barrels and nearly  net drilling locations demonstrating the success of our tests todate in all regions of course prices have fallen since last year so we also looked at our inventory assuming yearend  fiveyear average strip pricing and a  irr and that case still left us with economic inventory of about  billion barrels or roughly  years of inventory at our current production level in a nutshell our operations teams delivered better wells at lower costs in all our core plays through continued innovation in completion design and efficiency improvements this enabled better returns and significant increases in our drilling inventory which should put us in an excellent position at the other side of the cycle now back to jay jay javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director thanks herb so in summary although the current operating environment is very difficult were very pleased about our ability to take advantage of the oily optionality in our portfolio we believe we can achieve good returns on wells were drilling in our focus areas while preserving valuable acreage and value for the future liquidity as weve said multiple times is our first priority right now but our longerterm objective is always to generate top quartile debtadjusted per share metrics over multipleyear time periods shareholderfriendly balance sheet management and operational execution are both critical to achieving that goal im extremely proud of the way our people worked in  to capture cost savings and improve our well results and i know they will do the same in  with that well turn the call over for questions thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of pearce hammond with simmons  company your line is open pearce wheless hammond  simmons  company international yes good morning i was intrigued with your commentary about liquidity and the importance thereof but also the opportunities to buy back some of the distressed debt how do year bridge that gap where you can maintain that liquidity thats important to you but take advantage of the opportunity that the debt market is offering you a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey pearce this is wade i dont want to get too detailed on things we might be looking at but you said it very well were not going to simply just use liquidity it would be other sources of capital whether thats other financing alternatives or from some asset divestitures things like that pearce wheless hammond  simmons  company international now would that be above and beyond the  million of asset divestitures that you targeted in the release last evening a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president possibly possibly i would lean more toward the other financing sources but yeah thats something wed be looking at also pearce wheless hammond  simmons  company international great and then my followup wade would be on the credit agreement covenants are you looking to get some relief on that front through a renegotiation a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president thats what i said i dont want to get too detailed im obviously not going to speak for the banks but we are intending to get some relief as you call it or amendments to our covenants as we go into the spring borrowing base pearce wheless hammond  simmons  company international okay thank you very much a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david tameron with wells fargo your line is open david r tameron  wells fargo securities llc good morning javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director morning david r tameron  wells fargo securities llc page  that you referenced i kind of missed the number you said at current strip it was  billion barrels is that what i heard you say herb herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations yeah this is herb yeah thats correct its  billion barrels with the assumptions we have for yearend  david r tameron  wells fargo securities llc okay okay and then just not to get into too much detail but is the reduction there from that  billion barrels do i think about that as mostly eagle ford and a little bakken how should i think about that herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations oh yeah you know the eagle ford dominates our inventory so its mostly eagle ford david r tameron  wells fargo securities llc okay that was a simple answer and then jay if i just think about big picture i dont know if you go back a year year and a half you guys had  rigs running you take it down to your current of four how does the organization rightsize for that meaning i assume theres been layoffs through attrition et cetera but how do you think about when you come out of this on the other side assuming we do get some higher oil prices and you start to ramp back up how do you envision that javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director well i think if you look back right now david and i think its a great question and certainly my organization is asking that question too and im not going to say anything today that i havent said to them if you look back at the peak we were at about  or  people today were at about  thats a consequence of us closing our tulsa office last year and exiting the midcontinent attrition and then some small reductions weve taken just recently as a part of downsizing our exploration program so were down   in terms of total head count and you can see that already in our ga reductions were obviously managing every ga line item every cost item as closely as we can i think when you look into the future clearly activity is way down and we really believe that this first six months of  is going to be very ugly from a price standpoint and then youll start to see some improvement and thats certainly what most people believe too i mean its a hopelessly conventional perspective i guess but were trying not to kneejerk on head count because we really believe that well need a lot of our people eventually now my people our people know this if we get to the point in this cycle or at any part in this where we look out a number of years and say look our activity levels are going to be low for a long time then clearly we will need to make additional adjustments in cost structure and those are baked in to our longerterm projections when we run lowprice cases we certainly hope we dont have to get to that point we dont want to lose technical talent but certainly in any case when you look at really low price cases cost structure is something we simply have to look at along with everybody else in the industry i will say and i think its important that we say this if you look at where we are relative to our peers when we start talking about things like cost reduction and leverage and all these other things were much better off than most of our peers and sometimes i feel like people arent listening to us or just dont look at the numbers frankly on this so we probably have a little more runway than most people before we have to make those difficult decisions but if we get to the point where we have to make them we will make them david r tameron  wells fargo securities llc okay no thats good answer and then just final question service costs since even december it sounds like a number of producers are seeing additional service cost reductions you kind of alluded to that is that what youre seeing on your end as well herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations yeah david this is herb yes we are both on the rig side and the completion side i would say we didnt see as big a reduction as last year in the bakken and in december january we did see further declines there so yes we do see runway for lower service costs given price levels where they are a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president and then thats baked into the guidance i think weve assumed  to  reduction in  were already seeing ish right javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director yep david r tameron  wells fargo securities llc okay i appreciate the qa thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin smith with raymond james your line is open kevin c smith  raymond james  associates inc good morning appreciate all the prepared remarks especially the roadmap you laid out for the next few years as far as debt levels and you hit on some of this in your prepared remarks but would you mind discussing your bakken completion activity specifically maybe the change in completion activity in the bakken you were contemplating three versus six months ago versus todays budget herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations okay i think i understand your question kevin this is herb so our program we completed  divide bakken wells in  previously it was all three forks because of the results there being positive we plan to complete  divide bakken wells in  and weve gone from the swellpacker sliding sleeve design to the plugandperf is that your question sand loadings are similar to what they were before kevin c smith  raymond james  associates inc yeah right i was trying to get to i think before last quarter you were talking about getting very aggressive with the completion activity and now it seems like youre slowing some of it down and so i was trying to figure out what you were thinking about for the duc inventory herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations no i see where youre going so we are draining our duc count fairly significantly in the bakken and this is just from memory its around  ducs at the end of the year and were dropping down to about  so we are completing quite a few wells in the bakkenthree forks that have already been drilled kevin c smith  raymond james  associates inc gotcha and then one more question and ill jump off on your targeted divestitures did i hear correctly youre targeting selling  barrels a day and thats been fully removed from all  guidance a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president that was  barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter of  is whats been removed thats what been removed from the guidance kevin c smith  raymond james  associates inc okay perfect thanks for clarifying that thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt portillo with tph your line is open matthew merrel portillo  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc good morning javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director morning matt matthew merrel portillo  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc just wanted to circle around on the preservation of liquidity and just i guess ask a philosophical question on spending at an ebitdax level versus spending at a cash flow level so obviously as we include interest expense in the line items theres some incremental debt being added this year just wanted to understand how you guys think about that philosophically and what would be the triggers to potentially reduce your capital budget further if we progress through this year javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director you know matt its a question that we really put an enormous amount of thought into and it really comes down to preserving acreage if you look at our eagle ford position and even to our bakken position to some extent we have to drill a certain number of wells we have to maintain a certain level of activity to hold all our acreage and the way we look at the future thats very valuable acreage for the future value of the company when this thing turns around as i assume everybody on this call thinks its going to or we wouldnt even be on the call anymore that acreage is going to have real value to us and we dont want to give it up and so in order to keep like for example acreage in the eagle ford where frankly our margins arent that great right now and still have significant cash flows by generating higher cash margins in the permian we have to mount a larger capital program than cash flow thats just the way the numbers work out now if things get really awful at some point and youre convinced this is a lower than longer thing gas prices are going to be low for a long long time then clearly that assumption has to be revisited losing acreage somewhere where youll never drill it obviously is not a loss in value but at this point given where we are in the cycle given where we are from a balance sheet standpoint given how we see the world it makes sense to us to hold that acreage and that really drives our capital spending over cash flow thats the simple answer to the question matthew merrel portillo  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great thats helpful and then i just wanted to circle back on i think a previous comment from a previous conference call you guys provided some color around your expectations from a pdp decline or base decline perspective but wanted to just get your updated thoughts around your base decline at the corporate level and then i guess specifically as you guys have shut down your eagle ford completions from november till now how your eagle ford base declines are trending or how we should think about that on an annualized basis javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director well what weve said before and is accurate now is that our base declines for the overall company if you just stop drilling its high s high  range over  and i will say that if you look at what weve done in eagle ford eagle ford dominates our production i think total eagle ford productions almost  of our total production if you look at the fact that we dont intend to complete any wells from november all the way to the end of march and you look at the production drop between fourth quarter and first quarter and just do the math on that thats almost exactly how it works out you take more than half your production at say   decline over that period of time you get almost exactly to the math were showing for our first quarter result of course as we pick up our activity in the permian and we just completed our first two wells there starting into our program then the production starts to – it flattens out and your oil percent your black oil percentage particularly starts to come up and i want to remark on that because people need to understand a lot of our oil that we produce that we report as oil is actually condensate that comes from our eagle ford production and a lot of that is on the nonop side most of you are aware that anadarko has slowed way way down on the anadarko side so in fact our condensate production is falling quite a bit because our activity layer is coming down so a lot of what were adding here is highmargin black oil and that is really the big benefit of going to black oil that optionality is the ability to drive higher operating margins at a time when we really need cash so thats whats driving the decisionmaking there matthew merrel portillo  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc thats helpful thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brad carpenter with cantor fitzgerald your line is open brad carpenter  cantor fitzgerald securities hey morning everyone thanks for fielding my questions in the k you put out this week regarding the gas gathering agreement with regency and sorry if i missed this in the prepared remarks but i was hoping you could provide some additional details on that did you have to make any payments to regency to cancel the contract and i guess secondly what gathering agreements or commitments do you now have in place in the eagle ford herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations okay brad i can cover this this is herb so youre probably aware early in  we entered into a contract to expand the gas gathering capacity in the eagle ford from  million cubic feet a day to  million cubic feet a day that was not actually to be at that level until mid so regency had really not commenced the work yet so it was not a difficult negotiation i think both parties got together and we are having some expansions done that are more around efficiency across the gathering system that will give us some nominal increases but it significantly reduced our commitment youre probably aware our downstream takeaway commitments feather down over the next couple of years so weve worked it out to extend some of that with etc on our longhaul transport but not with a shiporpay commitment so i would say were quite robust on the takeaway side long distance and on gathering and we dont see any shiporpay risk in the next two years javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director yeah thanks herb and ill say just in general were working in every area we can to minimize the number of commitments we have in areas that frankly from a discretionary standpoint wed prefer not to drill so every area like that were working on ways to reduce commitment levels reduce our required spend to be able to get to lower levels brad carpenter  cantor fitzgerald securities okay great i appreciate that and then i guess staying in the eagle ford i think previously youve said you needed two rigs running down there to hold all your acreage but with the new  plan looks like youre dropping to zero by the end of the year how should we think about that are you able to hold it just by drawingdown on the – i think you show  ducs down there in the eagle ford and if so what do you expect to exit  as far as your duc inventory in the eagle ford herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations okay brad this is herb again ill address that one so on the acreage commitments the way our arrangements are were real fortunate first of all that were with these big ranches and have consolidated drilling arrangements so we were able to bank previous drilled wells that in a given year you can drawdown that bank on wells that youve already completed so that defers the day where you have to have activity higher so that is basically during  and into  one ranch were staying above the minimum and then the other ranch were drawing down those commitments and we have the ability to also do cash payout if necessary obviously were working with our lessors closely they understand the environment theyre sophisticated landowners and well be working that down does that answer your question brad brad carpenter  cantor fitzgerald securities it does yeah i appreciate that and have you discussed a kind of yearend duc number for your eagle ford that youre planning on hitting herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations yeah we drained the duc count in the eagle ford also i dont recall exactly where it is but its got to be in the s or s the number of ducs at the end of the year versus probably around  at the end of the year brad carpenter  cantor fitzgerald securities okay got you javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director i think itd be fair to say that given – we assume were going to have to do some drilling in the eagle ford in  herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations yeah javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director in any plan that weve built herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations yeah javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director but its not a lot and weve been able to reduce those commitments quite a bit and were still working on reducing them further herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations yeah in  we drill  wells in the eagle ford in the budget and then we complete  brad carpenter  cantor fitzgerald securities okay great all right thank you thats helpful operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike kelly with seaport global your line is open michael kelly  seaport global securities llc hey guys good morning wade gave an expected oil cut i think of  for q  was just hoping you could give us an annual figure for  and then maybe just talk in ballpark terms for how you expect this percentage to really trend in  as you put on more permian wells thanks a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks mike this is wade you know for  i did mention wed go from  currently to around  by the end of the year i think if you just assumed adding a percent per quarter youd get to that level by the fourth quarter i think that gets you pretty close as far as  were being very high level with respect to  and not really giving specific guidance but maintaining that level i think would be something you could assume now you would have to replace some oily divestitures in the fourth quarter of  but as we said thats about  barrels for the fourth quarter michael kelly  seaport global securities llc got it and are you assuming those divestitures all happen in the fourth quarter of  i just want to make sure i understand that a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president we are michael kelly  seaport global securities llc okay got it a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah exactly michael kelly  seaport global securities llc okay and then second question for me on the pv number that  billion i was i guess a little surprised at the magnitude of the drop yearoveryear and i just wanted to get your comments on this and really do you think that  billion value is a fair representation of the total value there of your proved reserves at a  oil  gas number or is there something that isnt really being accounted for whether its further cost declines efficiency gains et cetera that you think that that could be biased higher thanks javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director well mike obviously we understand these are sec numbers theyre run at current costs essentially and so obviously costs can come down further let me make a couple comments about that though you quote the  billion number youre leaving out our hedges which are a very important number its a big number and when you look at borrowing base and other assets you really have to include that all the hedges get counted in our borrowing base second youre ignoring the fact that and weve said this in the release that we pushed out a number of proven cases into the future because of fiveyear rule and those cases are still technically proven they still have the same value they just are occurring in another category now because our budget program doesnt get them drilled within five years theyre still there they still have the same value michael kelly  seaport global securities llc right javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director so those need to be added back on and i saw one comment where people were comparing that number to our debt numbers and thats not a reasonable comparison at all i mean first of all youve got to discount the debt the debts not due until after  so you know i think people a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president and its unsecured javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director and its unsecured okay and weve got plenty of interest coverage so i think the relevant question and i think wade answered it well is whats going to happen to our borrowing base and we answered that we think it is likely to come in under our current commitment which is the  billion number but not a lot under and then the real issue with liquidity of course is as you go forward in time is what happens to the borrowing base in the fall and next year and i will come back to the point – if youre worried about that with us there are a whole lot of people you should be a lot more worried about first and i dont think we get credit for that frankly and i dont mean to sound irritated about it but it seems to me like were getting a sort of throwing the baby out with the bath water on some of this stuff michael kelly  seaport global securities llc no thats fair thanks for answering that operator thank you our next question comes from the line of welles fitzpatrick with johnson rice your line is open welles w fitzpatrick  johnson rice  co llc hey good morning javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director hi welles a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey welles welles w fitzpatrick  johnson rice  co llc so i think youre perfectly allowed to sound irritated by the way it is striking how wellpositioned your balance sheet is given the pullback but i suppose thats neither here nor there can we get an update on the gors off the upper versus the lower eagle ford offsets in the north and south and then it looks like you added  acres in the eagle ford since the last presentation any color on that would be helpful herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations yeah this is herb ill address that so the interesting thing and weve learned a lot with the lower eagle ford and upper eagle ford and if you look down to the far south lets say pilot  and then southeast of there the upper eagle ford wells have a higher yield than the lower eagle ford so it would be like in some of these  barrels per million versus  barrels per million so we were expecting them all to be the same so in that case the upper winds up better if you go up to the north thats inverted its the other way around on the yield and then in terms of productivity the productivity of the upper and lower are very similar when you go to the southeast whereas theres lower productivity in the upper as you move to the very northwest so thats the yield level and you can just invert that if you want to convert it to gor your other question welles javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director acreage why the acreage number changed herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations oh the acreage so the total net acreage we have on all the leases in the eagle ford is  previously we had a polygon around the area that we were developing that was  acres so all it is is we wanted to be consistent on when we represented the k what our net acreage position is thats the  when you look at where were developing or potentially developing thats  thats the difference welles w fitzpatrick  johnson rice  co llc okay thats perfect thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of subash chandra with guggenheim your line is open subash chandra  guggenheim securities llc yeah hey jay good morning what is your comfort with having bank debt outstanding theres big liquidity numbers out there some folks like it at zero other folks dont mind carrying a little bit on it what are your thoughts heading into  a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president this is wade ill give you my thoughts first look itd be great to have zero secured debt we have a very sizeable borrowing base though and we just talked about what we think thats going to go down to so theres substantial liquidity between our outstanding and that number ill just tell you internally we dont mind carrying a little secured debt its very low cost it seems prudent but to a degree those of you that know us well know we have an internal policy that we would never draw more than half of our borrowing base at any time thats an internal governor we put on ourself but we look out in the future and try to predict what might happen with our borrowing base and we act accordingly you see us termout secured debt a lot thats why we have a good layered ladder of very longterm unsecured tranches of high yield debt but thats essentially my thoughts on how we manage the level of secured debt javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director i want to tell a little story when we first started talking to the banks about the covenant the initial reaction we got was first of all why and second well we got a lot of other people were dealing with right now wed really like to deal with you later so we have a super relationship with the banks we are at very good credit we have probably the lowest cost revolver out there in terms of what rates we pay at so we dont have a problem carrying a little bit of a balance here and certainly our bankers dont have a problem with it either subash chandra  guggenheim securities llc okay second question is so as these hedges roll off this year and you prepare for that in  i think i heard you say you would spend below ebitdax maybe a different phrasing than the  spending at ebitdax and i dont know if i heard that correctly but are there any other ways here of preparing for those hedges to roll off javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director well ill make one comment ill turn it to wade first of all were going to be below ebitdax a little bit this year too but certainly the plan is to be more below ebitdax in  go ahead wade a wade pursell  chief financial officer  executive vice president no thats the plan and we have some hedges in  as well which will be rolling off as you say but weve made some assumptions with respect to what were going to be drilling and ive given you the commodity prices that we assume in  and ive also declared that we think if we dont see the recovery by  that we think costs will continue to fall so thats baked in as well i think i said  or  and we would likely be jay said earlier looking at every line of costs and if we see recovery is not going to happen any time soon then well be making some adjustments to the cost structure and we would reflect those in future forecasts the outputs speak for themselves which i shared with you earlier subash chandra  guggenheim securities llc yeah i guess i was getting at if there are plans for further asset sales if there would be anything meaningful remaining in the noncore portfolio after the q sale this year if you have any intentions in  javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director our current  plan doesnt have a lot of asset sales in it i think if you really get in that lower for longer scenario theres always some things youd have to look at operating margins and make some really hard decisions about is there a time when you sell this stuff and i think the first decision you would make would be to stop holding acreage in those areas and cut your capital program in those areas first and then theres always these really difficult decisions about okay if i sell this now im going to get x value for it if i get any price recovery at all i get much higher price for it you got to make that decision at some point i think as an industry people are going to capitulate and start selling assets and i think youre going to start seeing some of that here in the second half but well see those are tough choices you have to make the first choice you would make would be to cut your capital program in areas where youd start to lose acreage and thats probably the first thing we would do subash chandra  guggenheim securities llc okay and a final real quick one there was a reference to how many sweetie peck horizontals were producing i missed it if you could repeat that number herbert s vogel  executive vice presidentoperations yeah its something over  we just added a couple so its plus javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director and weve just brought on two so far this year subash chandra  guggenheim securities llc okay terrific thank you operator thank you that does conclude todays qa session id like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks javan d ottoson  president chief executive officer  director well thank you for those who you stuck with
