underwriting and servicing fitch believes nmac demonstrates adequate abilities as originator underwriter and servicer to service b as evidenced by its historical portfolio and securitization performance evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market wvm is normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects increasing used vehicle supply from offlease vehicles and tradeins to pressure abs recovery rates leading to moderately higher loss rates fitchs analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak wvm performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation integrity of legal structure the legal structure of a transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of nmac would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of b to increased losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade however the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from ernst  young
