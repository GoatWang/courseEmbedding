in developed countries rebars with minimum yield strength of  nmm as against  nmm in ctd bars with high elongation values are specified for rcc work tmt rebars meet the requirement of even developed countries tmt rebars are stronger more bendable and have higher thermal stability because of unique technology used tmt rebars ensure greater safety due to high elongation of  tmt rebars are the ideal choice even for seismic zones     globalisation has brought in awareness in india about the deficiencies of ctd bars and superiorities of tmt bars as the demand for proper quenched  self tempered tmt rebars is increasing even in india the german cooling technology as it is the globally preferred choice we are among very few companies who are successful in producing right tmt rebars with proper specifications the consumers of tmt rebars must ensure that they are using graded tmt rebars this is essential as many rolling mills is india are merely spraying water on the bars in an unscientific way and selling them as tmt rebars their strength is even less then ctd bars the process is simple and effective it is worker friendly due to its unique process and proprietory hardware buland tmt rebars are preffered choice of civil and structural designers worldwide properties corrosion resistance properties controlled watercooling prevents the formation of carbides which has been cited as the main cause for the corrosive nature of common bars another reason for better corrosion resistance properties is the absence of surface torsional stresses caused by the cold twisting torsteel process weldability tmt rebars with carbon content less than  can be used for butt and other weld joints without reduction in strength at the welded joint bend properties tmt rebars have excellent bend properties due to the unique ductility elongation values obtained fire resistance unlike torsteel and ctd rebars tmt bars have high thermal stability they are the preferred choice when elevated

interest opinion morris j petitioner national steel products company seeks review of an order granting real party in interest jules rosen dba pantsmaker discovery of a report prepared by an expert identified as a witness for petitioner in the instant case petitioner argues that the report should be nondiscoverable because of the attorneyclient and work product privileges and in the alternative that the report should be discoverable only to the extent it is relevant the experts report is a technical engineering analysis of a metal building in new york it was prepared in  to assist counsel in prior new york  litigation in which it was alleged that the building was among other things negligently designed fabricated and erected by petitioner real party in interest was not a party to that litigation no portion of the report was ever disclosed during the new york litigation three pages of the calculations also prepared by the expert were disclosed one page by court order two pages voluntarily the expert was neither deposed nor identified as a trial witness in the new york litigation the new york litigation was settled prior to trial in the instant litigation real party in interest alleged that petitioner designed drafted fabricated and manufactured the components of a metal building in banning california in violation of the american institute of steel construction manual section  et seq petitioners attorney for the california litigation solicited the experts new york report from petitioners counsel for the new york litigation for background purposes after receiving express authorization from petitioner new york counsel forwarded the experts report and calculations thereafter new york counsel was joined as cocounsel for petitioner in the instant litigation in addition petitioners attorneys commissioned the new york expert to prepare an engineering analysis of the california building the resulting calculations have been deposed identified and inspected the experts declaration for petitioner states that in preparing his calculations and reaching his opinion regarding the california building he  did not refer to refresh his recollection from or rely in any manner upon  his  report on the new york building petitioner does not intend to offer the new york report as evidence the expert has been identified as an expert witness in the instant litigation pursuant to code of civil procedure section  attorneyclient privilege a petitioner contends that the experts prior report is nondiscoverable because it is protected by the attorneyclient privilege we disagree  if certain prerequisites are met a client  has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent another from disclosing a confidential  communication between client and lawyer evid code §  see city  county of sf v superior court   cal d   pd   alr d   the purpose of the attorneyclient privilege is important it encourages the client to make complete disclosure to his attorney of all facts favorable or unfavorable without fear that others may be informed greyhound corp v superior court   cal d    cal rptr   pd  city  county of sf v superior court supra at p  nevertheless the privilege is strictly construed because it suppresses relevant facts which may be necessary for a just decision greyhound corp v superior court supra at p   communication by a client retains its confidential nature though made to an agent of the attorney if the disclosure to that agent is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information to the attorney evid code §  witkin cal evidence d ed  communication to lawyers agent §  p  here because the attorney for the new york litigation hired the engineering expert to provide a technical analysis on the petitioners metal building in new york it was reasonably necessary for the expert to receive information from the client see city  county of sf v superior court supra  cald at p  real party in interest contends that the experts report here related to a material object of the client the building in new york and therefore the experts analysis of that building did not require confidential communications from the client this contention is valid to the extent the experts analysis of the material object is based entirely on information available to both litigating parties san diego professional assn v superior court   cal d    cal rptr   pd   alr d   grand lake drive in v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr   alr d  however here a declaration submitted by petitioner stated that the expert examined the building and  received evaluated and interpreted technical engineering information and communications originating from the client  although the party asserting the privilege generally has the burden of proof regarding the existence of the privilege di chadbourne inc v superior court   cal d    cal rptr   pd  the communications sought to be protected are presumed to have been made in confidence alpha beta co v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  evid code §  real party in interest fails to overcome this presumption because it submitted no affidavits or declarations stating that the clients communications were not made in confidence  real party in interest contends that petitioner waived the attorneyclient privilege by expressly authorizing its attorney for the new york litigation to transmit the experts report on the new york building to its california attorney for the instant litigation  the attorneyclient privilege protects the client see evid code §  the client does not waive this privilege by allowing disclosure of confidential communications to a second attorney when reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the attorney was hired as is here the case see evid code §  subd d real party in interest also contends that by identifying the expert as a witness the petitioner waived the attorneyclient privilege  if the client calls his attorney as a witness to testify to matters that the attorney could only have learned through the attorneyclient relationship he waives the privilege people v dubrin   cal app d    cal rptr  see winegar v gray   cal app d    cal rptr  it follows that the same waiver exists when an agent of the attorney is to testify to matters that he could only have learned because of the attorneyclient relationship this is essentially the holding of sanders v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  wherein it was held that the confidential nature of the communication is gone once it is determined that the expert is to be a witness  the client having impliedly if not actually consented to the disclosure of the information given to the attorney by way of the expert see evid code §  subd a just prior to its holding regarding waiver of the attorneyclient privilege and after a discussion of the workproduct privilege sanders v superior court supra  cal appd at page  held that if the party elects to  call the expert as a witness  the opposing party shall be granted a reasonable time thereafter within which to conduct appropriate additional discovery directed at securing the desired information that this language is not later qualified indicates that it is applicable to both the work product and attorneyclient privileges   consistent with sanders under the discovery act material which would not be privileged against disclosure at the trial is not privileged against pretrial discovery  caljurd  discovery and depositions §  p  fn omitted see greyhound corp v superior court supra  cald at pp  facts should be liberally construed in favor of discovery  greyhound corp v superior court supra at p  the way is now clear consistent with recognized privileges for the parties to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the issues and facts before trial id at p  quoting hickman v taylor   us    l ed    s ct  b accordingly we hold here applicable the conclusion of sanders that  the information and opinion of an expert respecting the subject matter about which he is a prospective witness are subjects of discovery by interrogation or deposition procedures and if submitted in a report confined thereto by production of such a report sanders v superior court supra  cal appd at p  in a general sense the prior report is an  opinion of an expert respecting the subject matter about which he is a prospective witness ibid the experts testimony based on observations and confidential communications regarding the california building will presumably focus on whether petitioner designed drafted fabricated and manufactured the components of that metal building in violation of the american institute of steel construction manual section  et seq the prior report of this expert of which discovery is sought is about the design fabrication and erection by petitioner of a metal building in new york in addition because the experts prospective testimony will necessarily disclose a significant part of the privileged communication to the expert the privilege is waived with respect to all communications to that expert see evid code §  subd a work product privilege petitioner also contends that the experts prior report is protected from discovery because of the work product privilege a threshold inquiry is whether new york law on the work product privilege should here apply because the report sought was prepared for prior litigation in new york real party in interest contends that new york case law holds that the attorneys work product privilege does not extend to subsequent litigation and that new york law should be applied a assuming arguendo that new york law does not extend the work product privilege to subsequent litigation we hold that california law  should be applied in this case see fellows v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr   questions of choice of law are determined in california  by the governmental interest analysis rather than by the  most significant contacts theory  under the governmental interest analysis approach the forum in a conflicts situation must search to find the proper law to apply based upon the interests of the litigants and the involved states offshore rental co v continental oil co   cal d    cal rptr   pd  see reich v purcell   cal d    cal rptr   pd  further under the governmental interest analysis when one of two states related to a case has a legitimate interest in the application of its law and policy and the other has none there is no real problem clearly the law of the interested state should be applied hurtado v superior court   cal d    cal rptr   pd  quoting currie selected essays on the conflict of laws  p  fn omitted see offshore rental co v continental oil co supra at p  b here california has a legitimate interest in the application of its law and policy and new york has little or none it is the policy of california i to preserve the rights of attorneys to prepare cases for trial with that degree of privacy necessary to encourage them to prepare their cases thoroughly and to investigate not only the favorable but the unfavorable aspects of such cases and ii to prevent an attorney from taking undue advantage of his adversarys industry or efforts code civ proc §  subd g in fellows v superior court supra  cal appd at page  these concerns were held to have equal validity to subsequent litigation moreover requiring california courts to determine the exact nature of new york law on this issue would be impractical and burdensome in contrast whatever the policy interests of the new york rule they have little or no import as applied to this california lawsuit the building that is the subject of this lawsuit is located in california and petitioner is a texas corporation with its principal place of business in texas moreover california law will apply to all substantive issues in this case based on these facts and the narrow context of the conflicts dispute forum shopping is not a legitimate concern of new york see reich v purcell supra  cald at pp  consequently the interest new york has is purely local and unsubstantial see id at p  new york can still apply its rule to subsequent litigation in new york real party in interests contention that new york law regarding the work product privilege for subsequent litigation should apply fails the california governmental interest test therefore the work product discussion below will be based on california law  the california definition of work product is here satisfied  within the meaning of work product is material of a derivative or interpretive nature obtained or produced in preparation for trial such material includes  findings opinions or reports of experts  jefferson cal evid benchbook d ed  §  p  see williamson v superior court   cal d    cal rptr   pd  mack v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  in the instant case the report originally had been prepared for prior litigation involving petitioner and counsel for petitioner in this litigation obtained the report as background material in preparation for trial  the work product privilege is conditional as it relates to the experts report therefore  good cause normally must be shown to compel discovery of expert opinions in advance of trial  williamson v superior court supra  cald at p  more specifically the work product of an attorney shall not be discoverable unless the court determines that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing his claim or defense or will result in an injustice and any writing that reflects an attorneys impressions conclusions opinions or legal research or theories shall not be discoverable under any circumstances code civ proc §  subd b code of civil procedure section  subdivision b strikes a balance between the conflicting purposes of the work product privilege and modern discovery rules on one hand the work product privilege exists to encourage attorneys to prepare their cases thoroughly and to investigate favorable as well as unfavorable aspects of such cases and to prevent an attorney from taking undue advantage of his adversarys efforts code civ proc §  subd g see hickman v taylor supra  us at p   led at p  sanders v superior court supra  cal appd at pp  on the other hand the liberal discovery rules of today are meant to  make a trial less a game of blind mans buff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable extent united states v proctor  gamble   us    l ed d    s ct  see greyhound corp v superior court supra  cald at p  in balancing the work product privilege against discovery the rule predicated on fairness articulated in the decisions is a shield to prevent a litigant from taking undue advantage of his adversarys industry and effort not a sword to be used to thwart justice or to defeat the salutary objects of the discovery act williamson v superior court supra  cald at p  quoting petterson v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  accordingly privilege statutes generally are narrowly  construed while discovery statutes are liberally construed greyhound corp v superior court supra  cald at pp   sullivan v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  real party in interest contends that good cause to discover the experts report exists because the expert was identified as an expert witness  generally good cause includes a showing that the expert may be called as a witness williamson v superior court supra  cald at p  see sanders v superior court supra  cal appd at p  as stated in swartzman v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  when it becomes reasonably certain an expert will give his professional opinion as a witness on a material matter in dispute then his opinion has become a factor in the cause at that point the expert has ceased to be merely a consultant and has become a counter in the litigation one to be evaluated along with others such evaluation properly includes appropriate pretrial discovery quoted in williamson v superior court supra at pp  here the expert of whose report discovery is sought was identified as an expert witness pursuant to code of civil procedure section  subdivision a for each expert witness identified all discoverable reports and writings concerning each expert witnesss proposed testimony and preparations to testify shall be produced according to the provisions of this article code civ proc §  as discussed in the context of the attorneyclient privilege above in a general sense on its surface the new york report concerns the expert witness proposed testimony see code civ proc §  review of selected  california legislation   pacific lj   the experts previous report on the new york building may either support or impeach the experts new conclusions regarding the california building  not all work the potential expert witness has performed for counsel however is properly the subject of appropriate pretrial discovery see swartzman v superior court supra  cal appd at pp  in scotsman mfg co v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  the product of the experts services rendered in an advisory capacity was held not removed from the work product limitation upon attempted discovery merely because the expert was a prospective expert witness more fully the court in scotsman mfg co v superior court stated that if and when the expert becomes a potential witness on behalf of the client the product of his employment is subject to discovery however the mere  fact the expert may have the dual status of a prospective witness and of adviser to the attorney does not remove the product of his services rendered exclusively in an advisory capacity as distinguished from the product of services which qualify him as an expert witness from the work product limitation upon discovery under the ruling in swartzman the information and opinion of the expert respecting the subject matter about which he is a prospective witness are subjects of discovery by interrogation or deposition procedures and if submitted in a report confined thereto by production of such a report however wherever the report may include the information and opinions of the expert given to the attorney not only in his capacity as a prospective witness but also as an adviser in the preparation of the clients defense it is subject to the work product limitation prescribed by statute ibid the critical distinction in the rule enunciated by scotsman is that between services rendered in an advisory capacity and services which qualify one as an expert witness see ibid nevertheless so far as we can determine california courts heretofore have not expressly elaborated on this aspect of scotsman we believe some elucidation would be beneficial we hold that an experts report rendered in an advisory capacity is one designed to assist the attorney in such matters as preparation of pleadings the manner of presentation of proof and crossexamination of opposing expert witnesses matters that are often reflective of the mental processes of the attorney under whose direction the expert works see state v circuit court for milwaukee county   wis d   nwd    alr d  in contrast we hold that a report which would qualify the author as an expert witness is one containing findings and opinions of the expert that go to the establishment or denial of a principal fact in issue see ibid but see kennedy cal expert witness guide  §  pp  applying the above analysis it will often be necessary for the trial judge to conduct a threestep in camera inspection of the report of an expert identified as a witness in order to rule on the claim of the attorneys work product privilege cf fellows v superior court supra  cal appd at p  first the judge should determine if the report in whole or part  reflects an attorneys impressions conclusions opinions or legal research or theories code civ proc §  subd b the work product that this definition represents is absolutely privileged it cannot be discovered under any circumstances ibid the judge need go no further in his  analysis unless all or easily severable portions of the report do not so reflect the thoughts of an attorney steps two and three of the in camera inspection are applicable only to those portions of the report that are not absolutely privileged in step two the trial judge should determine whether the report in whole or part is advisory or not pursuant to the above elaboration of scotsman the portions of the report that are advisory are protected by the conditional work product privilege the portions that are not advisory are discoverable if easily severable finally in step three which is applicable only to advisory portions of the report that are not absolutely privileged if any the judge should determine whether other good cause for discovery outweighs the principles supporting the conditional work product privilege see petterson v superior court supra  cal appd at p  scotsman mfg co v superior court supra  cal appd at p   as stated in petterson v superior court supra at page   if an expert is retained by an attorney only for the purpose of advising or assisting counsel to prepare his case the experts observations and opinions ordinarily are irrelevant and  may not be discovered by the adversary party unless there is some other compelling reason for discovery real party in interest contends another compelling reason exists to obtain the engineering report of petitioners expert witness even though it was originally prepared for prior litigation in that the prior report may impeach the expert witness new findings and testimony in this regard there is also no comparable substitute for the prior report these factors if supported by an in camera inspection of the report are in combination sufficiently significant to be weighed against the work product privilege  to begin with the need for pretrial discovery to prepare for crossexamination and rebuttal of an expert witness is the same or greater than it is with a lay witness kennemur v state of california   cal app d    cal rptr  accordingly an expert witness may be crossexamined regarding any scientific technical or professional publication if  the witness referred to considered or  relied upon such publication in arriving at or forming his opinion or  such publication has been admitted in evidence evid code §  subd b by declaration for petitioner the expert states that he did not refer to or rely on his prior report in preparing for the instant litigation nevertheless  it is important to permit an expert witness to be crossexamined concerning those publications referred to or considered by him even though not specifically relied on by him in forming his opinion an experts reasons for not relying on particular publications that were referred to or considered by him while forming his opinion may reveal important information bearing upon the credibility of his testimony law revision com com deerings ann evid code  ed §  p  italics added here it is reasonable to infer that the expert considered his prior engineering report in his preparations for trial this is because the experts prior report and current preparations had much in common both were completed to help defend against civil lawsuits that concerned petitioners design and fabrication of metal buildings moreover the prior report was compiled within five years of the experts instant preparations for trial  determining whether  denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing his claim or defense or will result in an injustice  code civ proc §  subd b  requires that a court weigh carefully the power of impeachment as a valuable tool in the process of truth ascertainment against the benefits of protecting the privilege of work product jasper construction inc v foothill junior college dist   cal app d    cal rptr  see brown v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  another compelling reason for permitting discovery is the inability to obtain an adequate substitute for that which is sought by discovery in petterson v superior court supra  cal appd at page  the court stated that it would be unthinkable to adopt a rule which for example would prohibit a litigant from taking the deposition of an expert who has examined or tested a relevant object even though the object is no longer available or the testing so altered the object tested that the adversary party cannot make like tests merely because the party who retained the expert has elected not to call him as a witness it is patent that such a rule would not be consonant with ordinary principles of fairness or the interests of justice see grand lake drive in v superior court supra  cal appd at p  the situation in the instant case is similar to that discussed in petterson real party in interest has no adequate substitute for the report it seeks because the potential impeachment value of the report  lies in the fact that it was prepared by the expert identified as a witness for petitioner and may include inconsistent prior statements of that witness therefore in step three of the judges in camera inspection of the experts report the impeachment value and uniqueness of the portions of the report remaining for evaluation after steps one and two should be weighed against the protections of the conditional work product privilege relevance petitioner contends that even if the attorneyclient and work product privileges are inapplicable the trial judge should order the prior new york report to be produced only to the extent relevant to the issues raised in the instant litigation further petitioner contends that because real party in interest  in its interrogatory responses had alleged simply that the banning building violated only a specific provision of the american institute of steel constructions manual of steel construction aisc section  the report and calculations should be produced only to the extent they concern this specific provision we agree that on remand the trial judge should evaluate the relevance of the new york report but find the application of this concept suggested by petitioner to be erroneous petitioner misreads the interrogatory response of the real party in interest real party in interests response did not allege that only section  of the american institute of steel construction aisc manual was violated but rather that aisc manual section  et seq were violated moreover it appears from answers to other interrogatories that real party in interest is still awaiting information such information might lead to further specific allegations with these facts in mind we turn to a brief analysis of the scope of discovery permitted by law for consideration by the trial judge when he conducts the in camera inspection of the new york report on remand  the trial court has broad discretion in ruling on discovery and will only be overturned for an abuse of discretion perkins v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr   discovery of all relevant material during the time of preparation is the aim of the discovery act greyhound corp v superior court supra  cal d   relevancy is a broader concept than relevancy to the issues the standard is relevancy to the subject matter which is determined by potential not actual issues in the case city of los angeles v superior court   cal app d    cal rptr  further discovery of unprivileged information should generally be permitted if it  appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of  admissible evidence code civ proc §  subd b see code civ proc §  subd a in accordance with the liberal policies underlying the discovery procedures doubts as to relevance should be resolved in favor of permitting discovery valley bank of nevada v superior court   cal d    cal rptr   pd  disposition it is ordered that a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding the riverside superior court to set aside its order granting unlimited discovery of the report and to conduct an in camera inspection of the experts report to determine consistent with this opinion  the extent to which the report is protected by the work product privilege and  whether the report is relevant the riverside superior court shall allow discovery of the report to the extent that it is both unprotected and relevant mcdaniel j and rickles j concurred notes  the parties dispute whether the new york report is relevant to the instant litigation although neither this court nor real party in interest have seen the report we will assume for purposes of discussing the attorneyclient and work product privileges below that the report is relevant we make this assumption because the previous report and the allegations here both involve the design and fabrication of metal buildings by petitioner nevertheless as we also discuss below to the extent the report upon inspection is found to be irrelevant this is an independent basis for holding the report to be nondiscoverable  on its surface grand lake drive in v superior court supra  cal appd at page  appears contra to the holding of sanders stating that communications between a partys attorney and the expert hired by that attorney are not unprivileged because the expert was engaged for the purpose of testifying at trial the reasoning of the court was that to apply this limitation in the normal attorneyclient relationship would remove the privilege from all consultations which had to do with preparation of the client to take the witness stand ibid the narrow context of this dictum consultation by the attorney to prepare a witness for the witness stand is here irrelevant the larger concept of waiver of the attorneyclient privilege regarding communications from the client by identifying an attorneys agentexpert as a witness is not considered in the grand lake opinion ibid  it might be argued that when an expert is reasonably certain to be a witness scotsman limits discovery to  the product of services which qualify him as an expert witness  regardless of whether other good cause for discovery exists see scotsman mfg co v superior court supra  cal appd at p  such an argument however would be unrealistic in the infinite variety of circumstances which may arise in the course of human activity as revealed in the complexities of litigation many other factors may collectively or individually justify inquiry into the acts and thoughts of the independent expert grand lake drive in v superior court supra  cal appd at p  national steel corp private company information  bloomberg july    pm et metals and mining company overview of national
