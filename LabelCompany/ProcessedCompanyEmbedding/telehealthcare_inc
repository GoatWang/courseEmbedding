mission treatment and recovery is tllts first pilot program to use the carepanda app beginning in august  and signed an annual agreement to use the carepanda platform on full time basis for their entire staff and facility   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   basis of accounting   the company’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting the company has elected a september  fiscal yearend   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when service have been provided or delivered the monthly subscription fees charged are fixed or determinable customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions and collectability is reasonable assured   we record deferred revenues when cash payments are received in advance of our performance   cash equivalents   for purposes of the balance sheet and statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of sis months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents   stockbased compensation and stock warrant expense   the company follows asc  stock compensation which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions asc  requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized grants of stock to nonemployees and other parties are accounted for in accordance with the asc  stockbased compensation expense is  and  for the six months ended march   and  respectively stock warrant expense is  and  for six months ended march   and  respectively        table of contents   use of estimates and assumptions   preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates the company has adopted the provisions of asc    loss per share   the basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year the diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and if dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants the dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method diluted loss per share are the same as basic earnings loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the company   fair value measurements and disclosures   asc topic  defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date the three levels are defined as follows   level   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets    level   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument    level   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement    the company’s adoption of fair value measurements and disclosures did not have a material impact on the financial statements and financial statement disclosures   the fair value of stock options issued is estimated at the date of issue using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable the blackscholesmerton option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions such as the expected stock price volatility and the expected period until options are exercised   income taxes   income taxes are provided in accordance with asc  income taxes  a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities   deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   no provision was made for federal or state income taxes        table of contents    longlived assets   management assesses the carrying values of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if there is indication of impairment management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the extent possible if these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value additionally if the company does not have historical operating experience asset carrying amounts are expensed for the six months ended march   and  the company did not recognize any impairments for its longlived assets management believes these intangible assets will continue to be utilized by the company to generate revenues    our intellectual property is comprised of indefinitelived brand name acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the company perpetually we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired for the six months ended march   and  the company did not recognize any impairments for intellectual property   intangible assets   intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life the company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period the company tests its intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment whenever management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the original estimate of an assets useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an assets useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment the company has not started amortizing the intangible asset until the official launch of its website    advertising   advertising will be expensed in the period in which it is incurred for the six months ended march   and  the

going concern while the company believes in the viability of its strategy to realize revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the company’s
