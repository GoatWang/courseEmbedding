our focus for  and finally we will open the call to your questions cam cameron way thank you hank good afternoon everyone and thank you very much for joining us our operating initiatives in  were focused on driving growth in subscription revenue and adjusted ebitda an important indicator of future subscription revenue is annual contract value or acv which represents the total value of our subscription contracts overall subscription client acv increased  to  million as of december   from  million as of december   the acv growth were lower than originally planned largely due to first year client retention and new client acvc falling below original expectations to address first year retention in mid  we began focusing on the quality of new client acquisition and new client onboarding to improve first year retention long term we targeted higher quality prospects and focused on solving the clients primary objective before introducing new solutions for additional objectives we also enhanced our client onboarding program in the third quarter of  to help the client successfully implement and realized immediate value from our solution this shift and focus negatively impacted acvc an acv in the short term but is expected to improve first year client retention in the future acvc is a leading indicator of future subscription revenue and this focus will delay growth in subscription revenue in the short term future revenue growth is dependent on increasing new client acquisition and improving first year retention rates beginning with this quarter we are now providing more visibility into the progress made within our target market by breaking out our client metrics between strategic accounts and small business strategic accounts are those clients from our target market that do business in a broad geographic area and have a longterm strategic interest in the state and local market small business accounts are smaller legacy clients that were sold prior to our change in business model in  acvc for strategic accounts grew  in  over the prior year our strategic initiatives including first year attention are focused on growing the acv of strategic accounts annual contract value per client or acvc continues to improve acvc as of december   for the entire customer base increased  over december   to an average of  per client growth in acvc continues to reflect the success of our initiative to acquire more strategic clients and upgrade existing clients into new and higher valued products in the fourth quarter of  subscription revenue grew  to  million compared to the fourth quarter of last year for the full year subscription revenue grew  to  million from  million in  as i previously discussed growth in acv is a leading

cost of revenue for  have been reclassified as operating expenses to conform to current period presentation operating expenses in the fourth quarter of  decreased  to  million from  million in the same period of  in the fourth quarter of  we incurred an expense of approximately  to independently evaluate potential future product offerings and to ensure that our product and content organizations were properly organized to deliver our longterm product and content roadmap this  did not reoccur in  in the fourth quarter the decrease related to the  special project was partially offset by incremental sales and marketing costs incurred in  required to support our initiative of accelerating future revenue growth  operating expenses overall increased  or  to  million compared to  million in  the increase in operating expenses is primarily a result of approximately  of employee separation costs and legal and consulting fees related to special projects incurred in  the nonrecurring

outstanding shares for the purposes of earnings per share calculations for further discussions of these results our business and financial results and risks and prospects for our business please refer to our form q filed in november and our form k which we plan to file in early march this completes our financial presentation id like to turn the call back over to hank hank henry riner great thanks for the review of our financial results cam the growth in strategic accounts demonstrates the discipline we have shown in defining our target market and the success we have achieved in understanding this target market and providing our clients with a strong value proposition our  initiatives are focused on improving this value proposition to this market and improving our financial results by accelerating new client acquisition and improving first year retention rates in  we will be focused on completing the migration of clients to the onvia  search experience which will deliver more actionable results to our users and a better search experience well also focus on improving the ease of use of the platform and delivering enhanced content that will further support our clients business development activities we believe that the initiatives we began in  will result in improved new client acquisition and firstyear retention rates that will strengthen our tenured client base which will put us on the path of realizing our growth strategy we have also built a very strong team to execute our growth strategy i am pleased to announce the hiring of alberto sutton as our new senior vp of marketing most recently alberto was the vp of global marketing at pyramid analytics in seattle we believe that albertos strong marketing experience will help us to strengthen our message and reach to our target market alberto joined us in the middle of february and he is now responsible for all of our marketing activities during the past year we have invested in expanding our leadership team to accelerate our growth alberto is the third new member to join the team youll recall that chris woerner joined us as our senior vp of product in may of  and most recently steve ritchie joined us as the svp of sales in november of  therefore we have three new members of our team during the course of the last nine months as we discussed our  operating initiatives focused on three areas intended to accelerate growth our subscription revenue and improved future adjusted ebitda the first  initiative was to further accelerate yearoveryear bookings growth the growth was planned in three key areas sales to new customers contract enhancements with existing customers and improved retention of existing customers the measure of success for this initiative included growth in acv and acvc an improvement in dollar retention bookings growth in  was lower than expected firstyear retention rates improved during  but not as much as originally planned to improve future firstyear retention we have focused on a quality of new clients and the acquisition of new clients which negatively impacted new client acvc and acquisition bookings in the shortterm both factors resulted in lower than planned bookings during the calendar year  dollar retention is a measurement of how effectively the client success team has retained and expanded existing subscription contracts for the  months period ended december   dollar retention is  consistent with the same period of last year dollar retention can fluctuate from periodtoperiod due to the mix of first year and tenured clients expiring in each period the second  initiative was to enhance the existing onvia platform and provide improved content which further aligns to customer needs this initiative included the continued rollout of onvia  search enhancements to our target audience our success measure of this initiative included the effectiveness of product releases and the related impact on acvc and dollar retention we originally planned to have all vertical ontologies completed by  as of december  we had completed ontologies for two of our three major verticals the last vertical will be completed by the second quarter of  once the ontology is complete we will begin the process of migrating clients to the new onvia  search paradigm we expect to migrate clients in our completed market sectors to onvia  by the end of  the third and final  initiative included improving the existing information technology infrastructure as a means to reduce complexity accelerate product development and ultimately reduce costs this initiative was focused on three major areas the first was moving to an open source search technology in order to increase our capacity for search and improved search speed first rounds of testing are in progress and we are preparing to roll this out by the end of the first half of  secondly we began working on changes in database structures to allow for faster more agile product enhancements in the future finally we addressed areas where data capture can be further automated to allow for cost effective scaling of data aggregation as i previously mentioned were focused on executing these initiatives in  intended to build on a results that we achieved in  and further accelerate growth both in subscription revenue and adjusted ebitda with the investments that weve made in  in  we believe we can focus on generating topline revenue growth to begin to create leverage from our business model once our fixed costs are covered adjusted ebitda should grow faster than revenues and drive value for shareholders we believe that we made the right investments in  to support accelerating revenue growth by the end of  just to review here is the following areas that we have invested in we now have new sales and marketing leadership in steve ritchie and alberto sutton we have an enhanced product organization to deliver clientdriven products and workflows which is head up by our new product leader chris woerner we are building a more robust content marketing program with compelling and relevant content geared to each specific vertical market that we pursue our business development team has expanded the use of business development associates to generate a new lead qualification program to support higher new acquisition sales we have expanded our firstyear onboarding program for firstyear clients to improve firstyear retention and finally the investment in proprietary onvia  ontologies will give our clients a better search experience better search results and we believe higher longterm client retention these investments will delay growth in adjusted ebitda in the shortterm however if we achieved our planned acv and revenue growth throughout the year adjusted ebitda should begin to accelerate by the end of  although our results did not meet our expectations in  we believe that we are wellpositioned to accelerate revenue growth in  that concludes our prepared remarks ill turn the call back to destiny so that we can take your questions destiny please go ahead and provide the instructions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions looks like well take our first question from george melas george melas thank you very much for the enhanced information about the strategic account and the small business account its really interesting and maybe i think can you talk about  it seems like now that youve given this information you exposed yourself to question about this information and i will start the process the strategic accounts there has been a nice growth in acv i think its roughly  yearoveryear and its mostly i imagine from enhanced contracts because the number of strategic accounts has not grown much and maybe  so can you maybe talk about that dynamic there and how difficult it is to get these new strategic accounts henry riner yes its always difficult i think george in any business to signup new customers but i think for us its going to get easier in  and beyond for a number of reasons number one we have a much stronger product now than we had a couple of years ago with onvia  giving a better search experience we view that as a key differentiator in the marketplace we have a much better sales team a much more experienced business development team with experienced sales leadership and steve ritchie joining us last november and our marketing programs are starting to kickin where there is more awareness of us in the marketplace than ever before and with the addition of alberto sutton we know that were going to be able to take the content marketing program down to the individual vertical level and create compelling relevant content for each audience which will help with awareness engagement and trust within those audiences so we think we can only get stronger there firstyear retention has been an issue for us and we addressed it hand on beginning in the second quarter of  weve created a new firstyear retention team that does much more intensive onboarding with new clients so we can ensure ourselves that the client is using our information and has incorporated our information into their workflows before we start deployment to our tenured account management program that is a change for the company we reorganized that first year group back in october and while its early its only a few months signs that we see so far are positive so i think we have lot of things going on in our favor in the future and one of the reasons why we didnt breakout initiatives in  is we feel the business is fast we spent the last five years really redoing the business restructuring the business changing the platform changing our sales process we think all thats behind us now and that now were ready to start growing and once that growth starts to kick in on the topline were going to be able to show that operating leverage on the bottomline george melas and then you sort of try to followup and elaborate on that if you look at your strategic accounts and things like on a net basis they grew by  during the year how many strategic accounts have you identified out there and do they all have some capability like you have from you or from competitors or do some of them do it internally can you help a little bit understand sort of the landscape how big they are and how big you are in this space henry riner thats a great question the market itself is about  companies  companies that had state and local government as part of their technical difficulty that means that they are committed to this market longterm that is our ideal kind of customer and as you know george we redefined that a couple of years ago and that is the market size our research tells us that the majority of those companies do it on their own now there is several different stages one they may just be working local agency relationships and theyre doing that either through a field sales force or theyre doing it through the channel partners they tend to be the most unsophisticated prospect and its the longest buyer journey to get them to adopt our solution because theyre not used to using intelligence the next group the group in the middle that is responding to biz in rfps and is either trying to do it on their own or theyre using one of the many biz services that are out there and those people are little bit further along their buyer journey and are little bit easier to sell and then you have small group of people who do use forwardlooking intelligence who do get capital improvement plans and budgets from agencies they use that to get ph specced in the projects that do not occur in two three four years out and they are used to using that intelligence but theyre not onvia customers those are the easiest to sell theyre furthest along the buyer journey because they understand the power of that intelligence and what it can do for them so if you look at those  companies weve got a small percentage of them today that are customers  but if you go beyond that the other  really falls into those three categories the big one is the ones that peoples that have just respond to biz in rfps many of them doing it on there own george melas and of that third category that do use thirdparty forwardlooking intelligence how big how would you size that group henry riner its fairly small i dont have an exact number for you but its the smallest of the three sectors george melas but thats really where your strategic accounts are most of your strategic accounts are in that space henry riner the strategic accounts are in that space today but we believe that entire  company universe is a candidate for our services we have to educate them on the power of using this intelligence to move their business forward and thats why were so excited about alberto joining our organization thats going to be his charter george melas but still when we look at the numbers and the sort of the really modest growth in strategic accounts in  it seems like the product is getting better the team is getting better the marketing program is better but how do you think that you can grow the acv for the strategic accounts on a doubledigit basis going forward henry riner well we dont give you a specific numbers we dont give specific guidance but i can say this that as the first year program kicks in and were not losing the amount of first year clients that we were before by definition we will grow faster so keep in mind thats a function of really two variables how many new clients were bringing in but how many of those first years that were losing and were doing a much better job and its all about training and onboarding getting closer to that new client because its intelligence has never been used by them before making sure postcontract that people are using the intelligence they get the value of it and they understand the utility of the solution and we spend a lot of time and effort in the past five months to fix that and we see some  its early i dont know want to kid its very early but we see some very positive signs so far so its a combination of not just signing up new people but keeping the new ones after signing george melas but i imagine if you have retention rate of  in the strategic account it is significantly higher than that henry riner well remember that the  is a blended rate its wallet retention not client retention so its dollars and its also a blended rate between tenure and firstyear first year is lower than tenure george melas first year is higher henry riner first year is lower george melas lower okay henry riner by definition  george melas multiple speakers the retention rate is okay henry riner so that  is a blended rate between the two george melas and if you look just at the strategic account what would be that retention rate henry riner we dont publicize that yet george we possibly will in the future as we build the base a little bit more the reason is we want to get the base filled out so the numbers are more significant and more meaningful for you because it could move around a lot from quartertoquarter but once we get there we will report on that george melas and then maybe just a couple additional questions tell us how the marketplace has developed in the last two or three years are people or sort of this kind of market intelligence being sort of absorbed by larger companies software companies project management software companies what is the landscape looking and how have those changes favored you or hampered you with potential customers henry riner the verticals that were playing in the indications are very strong for the future for example it there is a lot of spending for it in state and local governments in the foreseeable future because they are moving from owning it assets that go into much more of a cloud shared services type environment so that has provoked the spike in spending for it in infrastructure and construction and the education market we still seeing a lot of new construction with state and local governments not so much new but we have a lot of renovation work and renovation work is a key competitive advantage for onvia because were one of the few out there that really covers those projects if you look at people like dodge and people like cmd theyre just covering new construction theyre not covering renovation business services there are segments of that market that are very strong where there is much more outsourcing if you look at local municipalities they used to do their own billing for water for sewer most of that is now being outsourced especially as the billing function becomes much more electronic versus print through the mail all those particular municipalities are really not set up to make those investments on their own they have to outsource it to the thirdparty and we have a number of those thirdparty providers who are good of being customers so i think the market is strong we just published our sled report just came out in last week buying activity is estimated to be up it was strong in q of  were looking at strength in q of  so we believe this is still a great market opportunity now were defining a category in addition to defining a brand and thats a lot of hard work but i think were making good progress doing that and certainly by the end of this year were going to start see the results of that george melas and just like from another perspective from the point of view of your competitors how has the market evolved now youre competing really with people who provide sort of comparative information or do you compete with people who have bundled that into sort of a broader suite of product including some software or some of your key technical difficulty some project management henry riner you know george that deltek sells information and software and they have their own project management software and they sell information on government projects but delteks strength continues to be in a federal area we have a number of clients that have us for state and local and they have deltek for federal so there hasnt been much change there the big services are still out there that are novice we believe that we get further and further away from them as we invest in the platform and we get stronger as a company you still have the vertical market players like dodge and cmd but again we sell our services as complimentary so that dodge and cmd are great for both private and public new construction we go deeper in public and we cover all the work and renovation so we have a number of ae firms and construction companies and infrastructure companies that buy both of those kinds of services so there is nobody that is really out there trying to do what onvia is doing we have gotten a unique position in the marketplace were devoted to indiscernible were not concerned so much for the federal and were taking a much more intensive position in this particular market than anybody that we see out there operator and it appears we have no further questions at this time ill turn it back over to the speakers for any closing remarks end of qa henry riner well thank you destiny and thank you for your questions george and everybody else for listening on the call today we appreciate it cam and i are available to answer any additional questions you might have and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter operator and this does conclude your teleconference for today
