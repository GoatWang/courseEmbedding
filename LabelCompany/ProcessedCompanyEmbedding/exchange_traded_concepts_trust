concepts takes its etf in a box concept to a whole new level exchange traded concepts etc the firm that puts etfs into registration for third parties has gained access to mutual fund companies interested in bringing etfs to market through an agreement with us bancorp that could represent a quantum leap in potential business development for etc the etcus bancorp partnership involves the creation of a new “multiple series trust” that will enable mutual fund clients hedge fund clients and registered investment advisors that already offer funds and investments through us bancorp to begin offering etfs as well the new trust’s name etf series solutions is already on a filing to market three funds under the new arrangement etc already has its own multiple series trust or mst the exchange traded concepts trust under which a number of etfs have been registered but the new mst by virtue of the partnership with us bancorp and the bank’s association with more than  billion in mutual fund assets is a totally different animal “this is a big game changer for us and the industry” etc chief executive officer garrett stevens said in a telephone interview “this is the first fund service provider to launch their own etf multiple series trust” stevens said again the basic service etc is offering is the same one it already offers individual investment managers that want to bring etfs to market namely the marketing to third parties of its regulatory right to market etfs but the new mst will allow companies that want to launch their own etfs do so in a more costeffective manner by sharing a whole range of costs such as trust level insurance and board expenses “us bancorp is focused on the servicing of the product etc brings their exemptive relief and their advisory services” bob kern director of business development at us bancorp said in a telephone interview he said his company hasn’t filed for exemptive relief and stressed that using etc’s relief is an efficient way to bring etfs to market stevens at etc said that the multiple series mst model should appeal to niche funds that want to lower their overhead on specialty products such as hedge fund etfs “the typical customer is not going to want to launch a competitor to an ishares or an spdr ultralowcost product” stevens said getting into etfs quickly it’s useful to think of etc’s original line of business as angling with single fishing poles snagging clients fund by fund whereas the us bancorp partnership is akin to the company baiting countless hooks on a long line that etc is then dropping into waters teeming with fish the fact that etc was able to snag such a big partner speaks to the growing importance of etfs in the us moneymanagement industry as well as a trend in etf industry towards lowering costs including expense ratios in short it’s become amply clear that more and more asset and investment managers want into the etf industry before the market becomes saturated total us etf assets are fastapproaching  trillion and if the  billion that flowed into uslisted etfs in january is any indication about how the rest of the year will shake out last year’s asset gathering of  billion will easily be eclipsed in  while large and storied mutual fund firms such as fidelity alliance bernstein janus and dreyfus are lining up to win “exemptive relief” at the securities and exchange commission it appears that a company such as milwaukeebased us bancorp has chosen to offer its mutual fund partners a shortcut to offer etfs     indeed while gaining the exemptive relief at the sec necessary to marketing etfs can take from one to three years and cost upwards of a million dollars oklahoma citybased etc claims it can bring an etf to market for a client in about  days stevens said that his company is in negotiations with other companies interested in joining the ess trust but that it would take about  days before they are able to add any more funds “it’s been a trend in the openend space—many many managers are looking to that structure kern of us bancorp said referring to msts “they want to manage the assets not deal with all the administrative infrastructure” he said the first three funds the first three funds that etc put into registration using the new trust on feb  are alphaclone alternative alpha etf a hedge fund replication strategy that will be listed on the new york

nasdaqrobo from tony sagami i’m showing my age but one of my favorite tv shows during my youth was lost in space i was particularly fond of the robot which would regularly shout out warning phrases such as this favorite “danger will robinson” i’ll admit i also had a huge crush on judy robinson played by norwayborn marta kristen but that’s beside the point my point is that robots may have been futuristic science fiction in the s but they are rapidly becoming a crucial member in global commerce and manufacturing in fact robots are about to take an even more prominent role in our everyday lives how so “with government driving up the cost of labor it’s driving down the number of jobs you’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores but in restaurants” greg creed ceo of yum brands nineteen states — including california new york washington massachusetts and arizona — have recently raised their minimum wage to as high as  per hour as a result businesses are replacing human labor with machines to reduce labor costs wendy’s says it will install selfserve ordering kiosks in  of its restaurants by the end of this year about  of panera bread’s companyowned stores are already equipped with automated ordering kiosks and the remaining locations expect to have kiosks in place by the end of the year mcdonald’s is rolling out an army of “create your taste” touchscreen kiosks andy puzder ceo of hardee’s and carl’s jr said that robots are “always polite they always upsell they never take a vacation they never show up late there’s never a slipandfall or an age sex or race discrimination case” indeed automation — including robots — is going to affect a lot more than just your hamburgers and french fries last week blackrock the largest global investment management firm in the world announced it will increase its reliance on computers to pick stocks the firm will combine its traditional analysis with computerized stock selection as a result blackrock will lay off  employees including some portfolio managers the biggest market for robotics is manufacturing according to the international federation of robotics unit sales of industrial robots grew  in  while revenues increased  to  billion in just north america alone robotic sales increased by  to  billion but that’s just the tip of the iceberg barclays bank predicts that robotic sales will increase by more than  between now and  and that the value of that market will hit  billion so if you’re really serious about keeping up with the robotic industry you should regularly visit the international federation of robotics ifr especially during the last month of each quarter march june september and december when the ifr releases its president’s report go to

these expanding fields source robo global recent developments in robotics artificial intelligence and machine learning have put us on the cusp of a new automation age robotics is a key transformative technology that can revolutionize manufacturing american workers no longer aspire to lowlevel factory jobs and the cost of us workers has been slowly rising due to insurance and healthcare costs even when workers are affordable they are still human that means they have limitations when it comes to adaptability precision and reliability this can be problematic for companies that keep dreaming up the next generations of miniaturized complex products many of these products will only have a short lifecycle but they will serve as the stepping stone to those “products of the future” that are coming to the present day sooner than many think as william studebaker president and cio of robo global told me “the next manufacturing revolution is here and it’s being driven by robotics and automation robotics touches all industries and has the ability to be as transformative as the internet it is a foundational technology being applied to all industries all markets and all geographies and it is happening now we’re in a situation right now where robotics and automation are going to be as ubiquitous as computers basically we’re in the first inning of a baseball game where the team is still in the locker room putting on their cleats investors need to “futureproof” their portfolios to position themselves for this mega trend” chances are most investors aren’t positioned for the rising integration and demand for robotics in various industries for example the robo global us index has just  overlap with the sp  index and only  overlap with the msci world index investors miss out on megatrends like this because they want to call them “niches” biotech was once a niche … the internet was once a niche … cyber security was once a niche … and so on everything that’s new is considered a niche the easy answer is to just dismiss it amateur and professional investors are constantly chasing the stuff that everyone else owns this followtheherd mentality results in a lot of overcrowding that’s precisely why it doesn’t work the magic bullet in investing is to get there before everyone else one easy way to attain diversified exposure to global companies engaged in the

universe before their team did it no one else had related story remember that  milestone we listed earlier with a robotic arm ringing the nasdaq’s closing bell this was done to celebrate robo’s launch the team that created — and makes modifications to — the leading benchmark for robotics has an allstar lineup aside from the management team at robo global the following experts are advisers to the index committee source robo global the full committee took the better part of a year to scrub data and put together the robo global us index the index launched about four years ago its debut was untimely with a d printing selloff collapse in oil prices and negative currency headwinds so performance was lackluster in the early going however despite all those events the index has generated a positive return and recently it’s caught solid momentum last year the robo global us index returned  while the sp  index returned  and this year through almost two months robo is up  vs the spy’s spdr sp  etf  source ycharts the index — and corresponding etf — provides access to robotics and automation companies through  subsectors that fall under either technology or applications technology captures companies that enable robots to sense process actuate compute and integrate and applications highlight companies that incorporate multiple robotic and automation technologies into their product or manufacturing process to improve efficiency this results in holdings from manufacturing d printing logistics automation agriculture security surveillance energy healthcare and consumer products according to robo global’s index methodology the index is made up of “bellwether”  and “nonbellwether”  companies bellwether companies bws are wellestablished leading players whose core business is directly related to robotics  automation nonbellwether companies nbws have a distinct portion of their business and revenue in robotics  automation and have the potential to grow through innovation andor market adoption of their products andor services within bw and nbw each constituent is equally weighted the  weighting results in each bw having roughly twice the weight of each nbw at each quarterly rebalance the index constituents are reweighted and any additions or deletions are made as determined by the advisory index committee at robo global here are robo’s top  holdings source robo global etfs robo holdings  the growth curve for robotics and automation looks to be massive source bloomberg in closing studebaker articulated “robo global is steadfast in our belief that were in the early days of a disruptive and transformational change brought about by robotics we’d encourage investors to do their own due diligence on this industry and begin to position themselves
