in menusections httpwwwsfgatecomnewsarticlereviewproposedtesoroprojectwontposemajorphp review proposed tesoro project wont pose major harm phuong le associated press updated  pm wednesday july   seattle ap — proposed upgrades at the tesoro oil refinery in washington state wont pose major direct environmental harm according to a county environmental review released this week the review by skagit county comes after concerns raised by native american tribes conservation groups and others about tesoro corps  million project at anacortes tesoros plans include upgrades to help it meet upcoming federal fuel emissions guidelines the texas company also wants to produce a new product xylene a chemical compound extracted during the refining process and used to make plastics and other synthetic products dale pernula director of planning and development services for skagit county said the review found that if theres a major spill there would be an impact but the likelihood of that is low the review also found that increases in vessel traffic could contribute to cumulative impacts on endangered killer whales that spend time in washington state waters latest news videos pernula said the review sets several conditions including requiring tesoro to put in place a monitoring plan for archaeological resources when it constructs three new massive storage tanks the refinery would produce up to  barrels a day of mixed xylenes for export to global markets the project would add five vessels a month moving from the refinery on the puget sound shoreline to the pacific ocean the proposed project comes amid a larger debate in the pacific northwest around fossil fuels native american tribes and environmentalists have mobilized in recent years against a series of projects that would transform the region into a gateway for crude oil coal and natural gas exports to asia tesoro says its clean products upgrade project will allow it to diversify its products mix and ensure the refinerys longterm viability which in turn will benefit local communities with jobs and tax revenues critics say they dont want to see the region locked for more years into burning more fossil fuels that contributes to global warming we need to be phasing out oil gradually you cant phase it out if youre making hundreds of millions in investments said eric de place policy director with the progressive seattlebased sightline institute tesoro is also partnering with savage companies to build a massive oilexport terminal along the columbia river in southwest washington that proposal currently before a state energy panel has drawn opposition from tribes environmental groups some cities and a state agency over climate change and risks from oil trains tesoro says there will be no increase in rail traffic because of the project upgrades some have raised concerns to local regulators about increased vessel traffic potential for more oil spills and impacts on wildlife and other natural resources some worry about tesoros safety record citing a  explosion at the refinery that killed seven workers washington state regulators fined tesoro  million in penalties the company appealed to a state board and last month a judge overturned that fine the state plans to ask the state appeals board for a review we are committed to safely efficiently and reliably operating our anacortes refinery tesoro spokeswoman tina barbee said in an email she added that the company maintains spill prevention and contingency plans holding  response drills a year she said the environmental impact statement released monday by skagit county was an important milestone the environment review is typically used as a guide by local state and federal agencies as they make permitting decisions several tribes including the tulalip tribes raised concerns that increased vessel traffic would interfere with their fishing areas among other issues the review found that project is not expected to result in activities that would significantly reduce access to traditional fisheries latest from the sfgate homepageclick below for the top news from around the bay area and beyond
