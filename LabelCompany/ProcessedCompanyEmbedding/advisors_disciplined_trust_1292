deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above important information about benchmarks about risk there is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective an investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them this trust is unmanaged accordingly you can lose money investing in this trust an investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due volatile interest rates early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds as interest rates rise bond prices fall the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise given the historically low interest rate environment in the us risks associated with rising rates are heightened the negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future a bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded such action may adversely effect the value of the bonds in the trust and the value of the units the insurance provides coverage for the bonds held by the trust not on units of the trust invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice individuals should
