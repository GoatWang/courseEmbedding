honors researcher alexander landauer gave a poster presentation entitled “effects of freezethaw cycling on material properties of cancellous cervine bone as characterized by nanoindentation” clarkson engineering team places second in design competition an integrated design team from the department of mechanical and aeronautical engineering at clarkson university claimed second place in the rd annual undergraduate design project competition in rehabilitation and assistive devices sponsored by the american society of mechanical engineers asme the project was entitled “cost effective electrolarynx design a feasibility study” the design team was comprised of undergraduate students janine amell robert griffin madison malfa christopher nycz and allen osaheni and was directed by associate professor kevin fite and assistant professors byron erath and laurel kuxhaus  this marks the third consecutive year in which a team from clarkson has placed second in the competition  the objective of the design effort was to create a low cost electrolarynx for voice rehabilitation in patients that have undergone a laryngectomy the electromechanical device utilizes an electrical actuator to create high frequency vibrations of a diaphragm when the diaphragm is placed on the neck sound produced by the vibrating diaphragm is transmitted through the neck tissue into the oral cavity thereby enabling a person to produce intelligible sound through traditional tongue and mouth movements the prototype demonstrated significant cost savings over traditional electromechanical assistive speech devices that are already on the market while also having the added flexibility of adjusting the vibration of the diaphragm in order to optimize the sound production on a patient specific basis  six finalists for the competition were selected from  initial submissions based on a technical paper describing their proposed device and its impact on individual and public health the paper addressed product need and market potential development of a prototype device and an economic plan for its commercialization based on market analysis  the final competition that was held for the six finalists comprised an oral presentation and prototype demonstration by each design team and was held on june  at the  asme summer bioengineering conference in sunriver oregon  the clarkson students competed against finalists from the university of michigan rochester institute of technology university of toledo university of utah and university of delaware clarkson is the only university that has advanced to the final competition all three years as well as the only university that has placed in the top three all three years  as part of being selected as a finalist the team received a  award from the asme bioengineering division to defray the costs of traveling to the conference   more information about the competition can be found at

team wins nd place in design competition an integrated design team from the department of mechanical and aeronautical engineering at clarkson university has won nd place in the inaugural undergraduate design project competition in rehabilitation and assistive devices for their project entitled “a parital weight bearing reminder device for gait rehabilitation after lower extremity surgery”  the proposed device addresses an important need  following lowerextremity surgery such as a hip replacement patients are often instructed to avoid loading the affected leg while it heals  this is often challenging for older patients  when complete the proposed device will feature a combination of aural visual and tactile alerts to remind the patient to follow the doctor’s orders  the device includes an insole that can be inserted to any shoe or slipper and will be manufacturable at a low cost  to participate in the competition the students prepared short paper describing their proposed device in midjanuary  under the direction of assistant professors kevin fite and laurel kuxhaus the students elsbeth adams travis kiser rochelle laporte tracy roux and caitlin storey researched the product need market potential and economic plan in addition to their device design  the final competition was held on june th at the  american society of mechanical engineers asme summer bioengineering conference

abolitionist movement return to philadelphiaedit gibbs served as pastor of the first african presbyterian church in philadelphia from  to  he became active in the abolitionist movement a key figure in the local underground railroad and contributed articles to the angloafrican magazine following president abraham lincolns announcement of the emancipation proclamation gibbs delivered a sermon titled freedoms joyful day emphasizing that whites should crush their prejudices and that blacks should be allowed to fight in the civil war gibbs noted that we the colored men of the north put the laboring oar in your hand it is for white men to show that they are equal to the demands of these times by putting away their stupid prejudices he touched upon the need for blacks to fight by addressing white concerns and prejudices stating unequivocally that “ many persons are asking will black men fight that is not what they mean the question they are asking is simply this have white men of the north the same moral courage the pluck the grit to lay down their foolish prejudice against the colored man and place him in a position where he can bear his full share of the toils and dangers of this war ” along with william still gibbs fought for equal accommodations and transportation in philadelphia decrying segregation of the citys rail cars in a blunt article published in december  in the national antislavery standard still and gibbs asked why then should the fear exist that the very people who are meeting with colored people in various other directions without insulting them should instantly become so intolerably incensed as to indicate a terrible aspect in this particular they wrote further that “ it is well known that through the efforts of the supervisory committee of this city ten or eleven regiments of colored men have been raised for the united states service and not a few of these brave men have already won imperishable honor on the battlefield nevertheless thrice the number that have been thus raised for the defence of the country are daily and hourly compelled to endure all the outrages and inconveniences consequent upon rules so severe and inexorable as those which have hitherto governed the roads of philadelphia ” gibbs efforts in the movement to abolish slavery helped both free blacks and their enslaved brethren as the civil war drew to a close gibbs left philadelphia and journeyed to the south to help rebuild the former confederate states and to educate the exslaves and poor whites who were left destitute in the wake of the bloody ravages of war move to the southedit on december   gibbs announced his departure from the first african presbyterian church he was invited to go south for several months to look to the needs of freedmen his endeavor expanded into a project of several years as gibbs labored alongside other missionaries as part of the american home missionary society gibbs arrived at new bern north carolina where he wrote a letter published in the christian recorder he described postwar conditions the destitution and suffering of this people extended my wildest dream old men and women bending to the ground heads white with the frosts and hardships of many winters as well as the innocent babe of a few weeks contribute to make up this scene of misery gibbs eventually settled in charleston south carolina where he became established in a local church and opened a school for freedmen freedmen faced uncertainty as well as great opportunities as early as  the need for missionary activities among the freedmen was mentioned prominently in the first annual report of the general assembly’s committee on freedmen of the presbyterian church in the united states of america the report stated the condition of the freedmen their native peculiarities and the various influences to which they are subjected have much to do in determining the success of missions and the plan of the church’s operation for their benefit this same report also illuminated the perspective of northern missionaries in dealing with the situation saying that newly freed blacks are passing through a howling wilderness of social political and religious problems as striking and peculiar as those found by the israelites in their journey from the house of bondage to the land of their fathers and all these problems impinge upon the work of their religious education in every branch of it either directly or remotely missionary activity in the south was not a new occurrence the great awakening had been a period when many missionaries evangelized in the region in addition contraband camps had been set up near many forts and some missionaries lived and worked among them historian steven hahn has noted that “ the missionaries and reformers charged as many were with evangelical fervor sought not only to strike fatal blows against the institution of slavery but also to reshape the character and morals of the institutions direct victims assuming for the most part that the slaves had emerged from an experience of degradation and cultural barbarism they expected to teach essential lessons in the proper conduct of faith family health and livelihood as well as in the rudiments of reading and writing ” the established missionary work among freed blacks in the south was augmented by activities such as those o gibbs he believed in the power of education and the connection expressed in the  report between religious duties and the task of uplifting nearly four million freedmen in a letter to his old friend charles barrett of vermont gibbs proudly stated that he had one school that daily average in charleston  children and some  teachers during his time in south carolina gibbs also became involved in republican political activities during reconstruction gibbs participated in a meeting of black delegates who drafted a petition demanding that the educated of both races be allowed to vote suggesting he may have had some elitism the petition also said we do ask that if the ignorant white man is allowed to vote that the ignorant colored man shall be allowed to vote also gibbs noted that if we can secure for the next ten years three clean shirts a week a tooth brush and spellingbook to every freedman in south carolina i will go bail a thing i seldom do for the next hundred years that we will have no more slavery and both whites and blacks will be happier and better friends during this period gibbs met and married his second wife elizabeth they had at least once child who died in infancy gibbs remained in charleston but a short time not finding things to his liking he proceeded to jacksonville florida and there opened an academy for youth of that city reconstruction politicianedit  constitutional convention and rise to secretary of stateedit the  florida constitution signed by jonathan clarkson gibbs gibbs moved to florida in  where he started a private school in jacksonville he rapidly shifted from missionary work to political involvement in reconstruction florida religion and politics went handinhand for black officeholders in this period another prominent black officeholder charles h pearce remarked that a man in this state cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people gibbs was elected to the state constitutional convention of  he formed part of the radical mule team faction within the convention that initially gained control of the convention only to be thwarted by more moderate and conservative delegates led by harrison reed and ossian bingley hart canter brown jr wrote of the resulting constitution that while it established the states most liberal charter to that date it incorporated important restrictions on black political power it permitted most former rebels to vote at the same time specifying a legislative apportionment plan that discriminated again blackmajority counties in favor of sparsely populated white counties the drafters retained one item especially important to black leaders the constitution directed the legislature to create a uniform system of public schools the mule team nominated its own slate of candidates opposing the more conservative faction of republicans that nominated gibbs for floridas seat in the us house of representatives ultimately the mule team coalition fractured in the wake of the successful election of a moderate republican administration and congressional approval of the  constitution though gibbs did not win the election to congress he was appointed floridas secretary of state serving from  to  by wisconsinborn republican governor harrison reed gibbs wielded considerable power and responsibility during his four years as secretary of state in a letter to his close friend charles barrett gibbs remarked that in  i was appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate secretary of state of florida at a salary of  per year for four years and stand second man in the government of this state today gibbs power and influence contradicts some observations made by historians of this period eric foner noted that during reconstruction more blacks served in the essentially ceremonial office of secretary of state than any other post and by and large the most important political decisions in every state were made by whites however article viii of the constitution states that the superintendent of public instruction secretary of state and attorney general shall constitute a body corporate to be known as the board of education of florida the superintendent of public instruction shall be president thereof the duties of the board of education shall be prescribed by the legislature gibbs also was proactive as secretary of state conducting extensive investigations into violence and fraud including investigations into the activities of the ku klux klan and he also served on the board of

philadelphia decrying segregation of the citys rail cars in a blunt article published in december  in the national antislavery standard still and gibbs asked why then should the fear exist that the very people who are meeting with colored people in various other directions without insulting them should instantly become so intolerably incensed as to indicate a terrible aspect in this particular they wrote further that “ it is well known that through the efforts of the supervisory committee of this city ten or eleven regiments of colored men have been raised for the united states service and not a few of these brave men have already won imperishable honor on the battlefield nevertheless thrice the number that have been thus raised for the defence of the country are daily and hourly compelled to endure all the outrages and inconveniences consequent upon rules so severe and inexorable as those which have hitherto governed the roads of philadelphia ” gibbs efforts in the movement

increasingly alienated from his wife anna was accustomed to living standards that a young pastor could not afford the tension between husband and wife prompted gibbs to consider leaving the united

until  not long afterward gibbs returned to his native philadelphia where he continued work in the abolitionist movement return to philadelphiaedit gibbs served as pastor of the first african presbyterian church in philadelphia from  to  he became active in the abolitionist movement a key figure in the local underground railroad and contributed articles to the angloafrican magazine following president abraham lincolns announcement of the emancipation proclamation gibbs delivered a sermon titled freedoms joyful day emphasizing that whites should crush their prejudices and that blacks should be allowed to fight in the civil war gibbs noted that we the colored men of the north put the laboring oar in your hand it is for white men to show that they are equal to the demands of these times by putting away their stupid prejudices he touched upon the need for blacks to fight by addressing white concerns and prejudices stating unequivocally that “ many persons are asking will black men fight that is not what they mean the question they are asking is simply this have white men of the north the same moral courage the pluck the grit to lay down their foolish prejudice against the colored man and place him in a position where he can bear his full share of the toils and dangers of this war ” along with william still gibbs fought for equal accommodations and transportation in philadelphia decrying segregation of the citys rail cars in a blunt article published in december  in the national antislavery standard still and gibbs asked why then should the fear exist that the very people who are meeting with colored people in various other directions without insulting them should instantly become so intolerably incensed as to indicate a terrible aspect in this particular they wrote further that “ it is well known that through the efforts of the supervisory committee of this city ten or eleven regiments of colored men have been raised for the united states service and not a few of these brave men have already won imperishable honor on the battlefield nevertheless thrice the number that have been thus raised for the defence of the country are daily and hourly compelled to endure all the outrages and inconveniences consequent upon rules so severe and inexorable as those which have hitherto governed the roads of philadelphia ” gibbs efforts in the movement to abolish slavery helped both free blacks and their enslaved brethren as the civil war drew to a close gibbs left philadelphia and journeyed to the south to help rebuild the former confederate states and to educate the exslaves and poor whites who were left destitute in the wake of the bloody ravages of war move to the southedit on december   gibbs announced his departure from the first african presbyterian church he was invited to go south for several months to look to the needs of freedmen his endeavor expanded into a project of several years as gibbs labored alongside other missionaries as part of the american home missionary society gibbs arrived at new bern north carolina where he wrote a letter published in the christian recorder he described postwar conditions the destitution and suffering of this people extended my wildest dream old men and women bending to the ground heads white with the frosts and hardships of many winters as well as the innocent babe of a few weeks contribute to make up this scene of misery gibbs eventually settled in charleston south carolina where he became established in a local church and opened a school for freedmen freedmen faced uncertainty as well as great opportunities as early as  the need for missionary activities among the freedmen was mentioned prominently in the first annual report of the general assembly’s committee on freedmen of the presbyterian church in the united states of america the report stated the condition of the freedmen their native peculiarities and the various influences to which they are subjected have much to do in determining the success of missions and the plan of the church’s operation for their benefit this same report also illuminated the perspective of northern missionaries in dealing with the situation saying that newly freed blacks are passing through a howling wilderness of social political and religious problems as striking and peculiar as those found by the israelites in their journey from the house of bondage to the land of their fathers and all these problems impinge upon the work of their religious education in every branch of it either directly or remotely missionary activity in the south was not a new occurrence the great awakening had been a period when many missionaries evangelized in the region in addition contraband camps had been set up near many forts and some missionaries lived and worked among them historian steven hahn has noted that “ the missionaries and reformers charged as many were with evangelical fervor sought not only to strike fatal blows against the institution of slavery but also to reshape the character and morals of the institutions direct victims assuming for the most part that the slaves had emerged from an experience of degradation and cultural barbarism they expected to teach essential lessons in the proper conduct of faith family health and livelihood as well as in the rudiments of reading and writing ” the established missionary work among freed blacks in the south was augmented by activities such as those o gibbs he believed in the power of education and the connection expressed in the  report between religious duties and the task of uplifting nearly four million freedmen in a letter to his old friend charles barrett of vermont gibbs proudly stated that he had one school that daily average in charleston  children and some  teachers during his time in south carolina gibbs also became involved in republican political activities during reconstruction gibbs participated in a meeting of black delegates who drafted a petition demanding that the educated of both races be allowed to vote suggesting he may have had some elitism the petition also said we do ask that if the ignorant white man is allowed to vote that the ignorant colored man shall be allowed to vote also gibbs noted that if we can secure for the next ten years three clean shirts a week a tooth brush and spellingbook to every freedman in south carolina i will go bail a thing i seldom do for the next hundred years that we will have no more slavery and both whites and blacks will be happier and better friends during this period gibbs met and married his second wife elizabeth they had at least once child who died in infancy gibbs remained in charleston but a short time not finding things to his liking he proceeded to jacksonville florida and there opened an academy for youth of that city reconstruction politicianedit  constitutional convention and rise to secretary of stateedit the  florida constitution signed by jonathan clarkson gibbs gibbs moved to florida in  where he started a private school in jacksonville he rapidly shifted from missionary work to political involvement in reconstruction florida religion and politics went handinhand for black officeholders in this period another prominent black officeholder charles h pearce remarked that a man in this state cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people gibbs was elected to the state constitutional convention of  he formed part of the radical mule team faction within the convention that initially gained control of the convention only to be thwarted by more moderate and conservative delegates led by harrison reed and ossian bingley hart canter brown jr wrote of the resulting constitution that while it established the states most liberal charter to that date it incorporated important restrictions on black political power it permitted most former rebels to vote at the same time specifying a legislative apportionment plan that discriminated again blackmajority counties in favor of sparsely populated white counties the drafters retained one item especially important to black leaders the constitution directed the legislature to create a uniform system of public schools the mule team nominated its own slate of candidates opposing the more conservative faction of republicans that nominated gibbs for floridas seat in the us house of representatives ultimately the mule team coalition fractured in the wake of the successful election of a moderate republican administration and congressional approval of the  constitution though gibbs did not win the election to congress he was appointed floridas secretary of state serving from  to  by wisconsinborn republican governor harrison reed gibbs wielded considerable power and responsibility during his four years as secretary of state in a letter to his close friend charles barrett gibbs remarked that in  i was appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate secretary of state of florida at a salary of  per year for four years and stand second man in the government of this state today gibbs power and influence contradicts some observations made by historians of this period eric foner noted that during reconstruction more blacks served in the essentially ceremonial office of secretary of state than any other post and by and large the most important political decisions in every state were made by whites however article viii of the constitution states that the superintendent of public instruction secretary of state and attorney general shall constitute a body corporate to be known as the board of education of florida the superintendent of public instruction shall be president thereof the duties of the board of education shall be prescribed by the legislature gibbs also was proactive as secretary of state conducting extensive investigations into violence and fraud including

lengthy and bitter divorce proceedings which lasted until  not long afterward gibbs returned to his native philadelphia where he continued work in the abolitionist movement return to philadelphiaedit gibbs served as pastor of the first african presbyterian church in philadelphia from  to  he became active in the abolitionist movement a key figure in the local underground railroad and contributed articles to the angloafrican magazine following president abraham lincolns announcement of the emancipation proclamation gibbs delivered a sermon titled freedoms joyful day emphasizing that whites should crush their prejudices and that blacks should be allowed to fight in the civil war gibbs noted that we the colored men of the north put the laboring oar in your hand it is for white men to show that they are equal to the demands of these times by putting away their stupid prejudices he touched upon the need for blacks to fight by addressing white concerns and prejudices stating unequivocally that “ many persons are asking will black men fight that is not what they mean the question they are asking is simply this have white men of the north the same moral courage the pluck the grit to lay down their foolish prejudice against the colored man and place him in a position where he can bear his full share of the toils and dangers of this war ” along with william still gibbs fought for equal accommodations and transportation in philadelphia decrying segregation of the citys rail cars in a blunt article published in december  in the national antislavery standard still and gibbs asked why then should the fear exist that the very people who are meeting with colored people in various other directions without insulting them should instantly become so intolerably incensed as to indicate a terrible aspect in this particular they wrote further that “ it is well known that through the efforts of the supervisory committee of this city ten or eleven regiments of colored men have been raised for the united states service and not a few of these brave men have already won imperishable honor on the battlefield nevertheless thrice the number that have been thus raised for the defence of the country are daily and hourly compelled to endure all the outrages and inconveniences consequent upon rules so severe and inexorable as those which have hitherto governed the roads of philadelphia ” gibbs efforts in the movement to abolish slavery helped both free blacks and their enslaved brethren as the civil war drew to a close gibbs left philadelphia and journeyed to the south to help rebuild the former confederate states and to educate the exslaves and poor whites who were left destitute in the wake of the bloody ravages of war move to the southedit on december   gibbs announced his departure from the first african presbyterian church he was invited to go south for several months to look to the needs of freedmen his endeavor expanded into a project of several years as gibbs labored alongside other missionaries as part of the american home missionary society gibbs arrived at new bern north carolina where he wrote a letter published in the christian recorder he described postwar conditions the destitution and suffering of this people extended my wildest dream old men and women bending to the ground heads white with the frosts and hardships of many winters as well as the innocent babe of a few weeks contribute to make up this scene of misery gibbs eventually settled in charleston south carolina where he became established in a local church and opened a school for freedmen freedmen faced uncertainty as well as great opportunities as early as  the need for missionary activities among the freedmen was mentioned prominently in the first annual report of the general assembly’s committee on freedmen of the presbyterian church in the united states of america the report stated the condition of the freedmen their native peculiarities and the various influences to which they are subjected have much to do in determining the success of missions and the plan of the church’s operation for their benefit this same report also illuminated the perspective of northern missionaries in dealing with the situation saying that newly freed blacks are passing through a howling wilderness of social political and religious problems as striking and peculiar as those found by the israelites in their journey from the house of bondage to the land of their fathers and all these problems impinge upon the work of their religious education in every branch of it either directly or remotely missionary activity in the south was not a new occurrence the great awakening had been a period when many missionaries evangelized in the region in addition contraband camps had been set up near many forts and some missionaries lived and worked among them historian steven hahn has noted that “ the missionaries and reformers charged as many were with evangelical fervor sought not only to strike fatal blows against the institution of slavery but also to reshape the character and morals of the institutions direct victims assuming for the most part that the slaves had emerged from an experience of degradation and cultural barbarism they expected to teach essential lessons in the proper conduct of faith family health and livelihood as well as in the rudiments of reading and writing ” the established missionary work among freed blacks in the south was augmented by activities such as those o gibbs he believed in the power of education and the connection expressed in the  report between religious duties and the task of uplifting nearly four million freedmen in a letter to his old friend charles barrett of vermont gibbs proudly stated that he had one school that daily average in charleston  children and some  teachers during his time in south carolina gibbs also became involved in republican political activities during reconstruction gibbs participated in a meeting of black delegates who drafted a petition demanding that the educated of both races be allowed to vote suggesting he may have had some elitism the petition also said we do ask that if the ignorant white man is allowed to vote that the ignorant colored man shall be allowed to vote also gibbs noted that if we can secure for the next ten years three clean shirts a week a tooth brush and spellingbook to every freedman in south carolina i will go bail a thing i seldom do for the next hundred years that we will have no more slavery and both whites and blacks will be happier and better friends during this period gibbs met and married his second wife elizabeth they had at least once child who died in infancy gibbs remained in charleston but a short time not finding things to his liking he proceeded to jacksonville florida and there opened an academy for youth of that city reconstruction politicianedit  constitutional convention and rise to secretary of stateedit the  florida constitution signed by jonathan clarkson gibbs gibbs moved to florida in  where he started a private school in jacksonville he rapidly shifted from missionary work to political involvement in reconstruction florida religion and politics went handinhand for black officeholders in this period another prominent black officeholder charles h pearce remarked that a man in this state cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people gibbs was elected to the state constitutional convention of  he formed part of the radical mule team faction within the convention that initially gained control of the convention only to be thwarted by more moderate and conservative delegates led by harrison reed and ossian bingley hart canter brown jr wrote of the resulting constitution that while it established the states most liberal charter to that date it incorporated important restrictions on black political power it permitted most former rebels to vote at the same time specifying a legislative apportionment plan that discriminated again blackmajority counties in favor of sparsely populated white counties the drafters retained one item especially important to black leaders the constitution directed the legislature to create a uniform system of public schools the mule team nominated its own slate of candidates opposing the more conservative faction of republicans that nominated gibbs for floridas seat in the us house of representatives ultimately the mule team coalition fractured in the wake of the successful election of a moderate republican administration and congressional approval of the  constitution though gibbs did not win the election to congress he was appointed floridas secretary of state serving from  to  by wisconsinborn republican governor harrison reed gibbs wielded considerable power and responsibility during his four years as secretary of state in a letter to his close friend charles barrett gibbs remarked that in  i was appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate secretary of state of florida at a salary of  per year for four years and stand second man in the government of this state today gibbs power and influence contradicts some observations made by historians of this period eric foner noted that during reconstruction more blacks served in the essentially ceremonial office of secretary of state than any other post and by and large the most important political decisions in every state were made by whites however article viii of the constitution states that the superintendent of public instruction secretary of state and attorney general shall constitute a body corporate to be known as the board of education of florida the superintendent of public instruction shall be president thereof the duties of the board of education shall be prescribed by the legislature gibbs also was proactive as secretary of state conducting extensive investigations into violence and fraud including investigations into the activities of the ku klux klan and he also served on the board of canvassers testifying on behalf of josiah thomas
