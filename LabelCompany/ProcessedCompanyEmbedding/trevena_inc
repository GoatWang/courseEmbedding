olinvo has been designated a breakthrough therapy by the u s food and drug administration in february  we announced topline results from two phase  pivotal efficacy studies testing multiple olinvo dosing regimens in both studies all dose regimens achieved their primary endpoint of statistically greater analgesic efficacy than placebo as required for fda approval in addition compared to a commonly used iv morphine regimen patients given one of the tested olinvo regimens experienced comparable pain relief with numerically less frequent adverse events including vomiting and multiple indicators of respiratory safety â both key unmet needs in acute pain management olinvo was specifically designed to improve on conventional iv opioid pharmacology by binding to the same endorphin receptor as conventional opioids and selectively activating the pathway leading to pain relief while avoiding a pathway associated with opioidrelated adverse effects clinical trial results have consistently suggested that olinvo may provide rapid and effective pain relief while potentially setting a new standard for opioid safety and tolerability our pipeline also includes several product

these discoveries have attracted substantial research interest in part because the delta receptor is not associated with the addiction liability of mu opioid drugs like morphine or oxycodone however delta receptor activation has caused seizures in preclinical studies limiting the utility of many known delta receptor agonists several approaches to separating these delta receptor effects have been attempted but none has yet achieved human proof of concept and no selective delta receptor agonists have been approved for human use mechanism hypothesis for trv trevena scientists discovered that delta receptormediated seizures are reduced in î˛arrestin knockout mice while effects linked to therapeutic benefit are preserved this suggests that a g proteinbiased ligand may be able to avoid delta receptormediated seizures while preserving the proposed cns benefits of previous delta receptor agonists other preclinical work has showed that delta receptor biased ligands may offer improved efficacy over unbiased ligands in mood disorders trevena scientists leveraged these discoveries and trevenaâs able™ platform to design trv a small molecule g protein biased ligand targeting the deltareceptor based on the initial profile of trv we anticipate focusing our initial development efforts on the acute treatment of episodic and chronic migraine headaches with a goal of providing a

contact contact directions to trevena what is a biased ligand trevenas able platform history of biased ligands   history of gpcr biased ligands the capacity of a receptor to signal through both g proteins and βarrestins was discovered in the late s and early s in the laboratory of robert lefkowitz md at duke university using the angiotensin ii receptor as a model we now know that βarrestins can activate a broad set of intracellular signaling molecules for numerous gpcrs later work demonstrated that g protein and βarrestin pathways are distinct and can be pharmacologically modulated independently with biased ligands in the mid s a handful of biased ligands were discovered that specifically targeted g protein or βarrestin signaling and the idea of biased gpcr signaling emerged as a new theme in receptor biology with a new appreciation of the diversity of signals that can be elicited by gpcr ligands dr lefkowitz and his colleague howard rockman md also at duke university began to consider the possibility that biased ligands had the potential to uniquely modify gpcrmediated pharmacology to deliver new and differentiated medicines dr lefkowitz was awarded the  nobel prize for chemistry for his studies of gpcrs his nobel lecture including discussion of biased ligands can be viewed on the nobel prize website trevena was founded to harness the promise of biased ligands with drs lefkowitz and rockman as academic cofounders the company has successfully demonstrated that biased ligands can be discovered and optimized for a number of distinct gpcrs furthermore these biased ligands exhibit a unique spectrum of pharmacological responses this approach has the potential to deliver the next generation of gpcrtargeted therapeutics to meet significant unmet patient needs trevena has discovered multiple biased ligands now in development as potential firstinclass and bestinclass medicines to treat serious unmet medical needs references  lefkowitz rj and shenoy sk
