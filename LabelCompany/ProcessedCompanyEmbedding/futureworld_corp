available and dry herb versions available in the coming months urvape was started to contribute to the current revolution which has become an international phenomenon known as the vaping industry urvape began test marketing oem branded offtheshelf oil vaporizers whose design and utility was well received and which promulgated our first vendor agreement in the state of colorado after studying the marketplace with more than  vendors attempting to reach nicotine consumers we recognized early on that there were unsupported claims and deficiencies in the products and eliquids being sold product deficiencies were noted in the devices being used in combination with eliquids which together could be producing harmful elements consequently these elements are being inhaled as a result of heating the contents of the eliquids thereby producing potentially harmful changes to the initial ingredients as a result urvape has dedicated itself to providing products that are free of any substances which when heated for vaping could be harmful urvape has entered into an exclusive nondisclosurenoncompete contract with one of the foremost international vaping products manufacturers through our inhouse product development personnel and through the hiring of a consultant whose area of expertise is microbiology specific to cannabis and vaping we have developed two primary device changes that are being patented these changes are designed to produce safe devices built with safe materials and to exact temperature specifications suited to a variety of eliquids that we will bring to market we are also developing new methods of producing packaging and flavoring a variety of eliquids with the intention to provide consumers with happy healthy and potentially curative products   urvape’s plans include the installation of its own laboratory along with a clean room for production of its products the goal is to become the market leader of safe vaping materials to that end urvape has trademarked safevape for use in describing the technologies utilized in bringing both devices and eliquids to the marketplace     the ecigarette cannabis and herbal vaping industry is an ever growing and evolving industry business models need to be constantly adjusted and configured based on all moving parts but we are fortunate to be part of this historical moment in time where consumers around the globe will finally have access to natural plant derivatives to enhance their health and enjoyment without the inherent side effects of synthetic medicines urvape will be part of that historical moment creating technologies for the delivery of its specialized researched products with the decriminalization and legalization of cannabis for medicinal and recreational use in many states and countries throughout the world the adoption of electronic vaporizing by the world’s  billion smokers  ecig or vaporizer market is the fastest market within the tobacco free industry and estimated to be a multibillion dollar industry within a few years hemptech corp hemptech corp has several products available specifically geared to helping cultivators of industrial hemp and medical cannabis maximum yields while helping to control costs cannalytix™  spider™ smartsense™ smartnrg™  and cannatrak™ cannalytix™ “a picture is worth a thousand words” and being able to visualize all the various aspects of a cultivation enterprise solves challenges before they become problems cannalytix™ is a dashboard controller system that allows the various computer systems to be integrated throughout a cultivator’s infrastructures using stateof –theart api connecting software packages cannalytix™ can allow all computer systems to be monitored with the ease of a smartphone app and the robust hardware of integrated servers or cloudbased application cannatrak™  the next generation of barcode  rfid tracking systems for keeping pace with the extensive demands of seed to sale tracking of hempcannabis for state compliance we are currently developing “game changer” modifications that will make it the ultimate software system in the industry cannatrak’s asset tracking management software automates the major aspects of the asset life cycle the product suite is made up of modules which are able to operate independently of one another are able to be configured to work together or to be integrated with nonnative applications cannatrak™ software easily tracks assets using bar coding radio frequency rfid imaging and wireless technologies cannatrak™ software is designed under the clientserver architecture is multiuser and menudriven following industrystandard ms windows protocols and graphical user interfaces cannatrak™ applications are compatible with ms windows xp vista windows    operating systems and with sql server  through  cannatrak’s mobile information applications are compatible with windows mobile devices and are tightly integrated with bar coding rfid gps imaging biometrics and wireless technologies due to the state law legal governance compliance and tax reasons we believe cannatrak™ will be an invaluable tool for legal compliance and profitability from growers to dispensers of the legal medicinal marijuana over the past decade  any change since november electionsstates have approved the use of medicinal marijuana medicinal marijuana has become an alternative to traditional treatments for patients with clinical diseases such as cancer and hivaids the medicinal marijuana market is estimated to be valued in the billions of dollars initially and may provide hundreds of millions of dollars tax revenue for the state’s tax coffers we believe compliance and governance will be a big concern for the state offices overseeing the cannabis lifecycle and cannatrak™ will be an invaluable tool to comply and monitor for the medicinal marijuana industry our competition presently consists of the mits system being used in the state of colorado the biotrackthc system being used in the state of washington and mj freeway certainly we will look to enter every burgeoning market throughout the united states spider secure perimeter intrusion detection network is a system to meet the needs of theft and malicious attacks while the economy is seeing improvement theft site destruction and malicious activity are still happening at an alarming rate and within the legal cannabishemp industry surging forward we can expect no change particularly because of its specific draw the spider systems consist of  levels of detection to identify intruders and threats in areas that are restricted the first level utilizes an electronically charged coaxial cable woven into your chain link fencing excessive fence movement will set off an alarm through your network notification system that someone is attempting to enter your facility this is a very cost effective means to secure your site to meet security requirements for your company the second level consists of a visual intrusion monitoring system it is a wireless battery operated and connected through the cellular network it provides  monitoring and notification through the internet and email system once an intruder is identified an alarm is sent to the security team with a picture that allows you to identify if this is an authorized or unauthorized person the network system can quickly be deployed and moved to provide security coverage as needed the third level is a multilevel detection and verification system that uses both level one and level two to rapidly identify a potential intruder and provide you information for a rapid decision the combination of the two systems provides the additional barriers for quick action sometimes seconds are critical in preventing serious damage or theft at your site the command center software provides intrusion notification to your network center and to individuals via email for level two and three you receive a picture that enables you to make a more informed and quicker decision concerning your action     the spider solution addresses the potential threat facing the entire cannabishemp industry with this system you are able to supply your security team with information that enables them to be proactive in addressing these costly activities compliance with state rules and regulations for the cannabis hemp industry is going to be essential though there are many security companies on the market few are adapting themselves to the cannabis industry smartsense  offers wireless security and smart sensor mesh network for precision agriculture irrigation systems and greenhouses for the hemp industry our smart agriculture models allow monitoring multiple environmental parameters involving a wide range of applications with smart sensors such as leaf wetness atmospheric pressure solar radiation air temperature  humidity soil temperature  moisture ultraviolet radiation etc the smart sensor information will be collected and sent via the cloud to the central office for analysis and procedural modifications futureworld is not aware of any another competitor in the united states futureworld through hemptech plans on marketing the product to large and medium sized grow facilities since they will have the greatest need smartnergy  offers tools to analyze every aspect of a cultivator’s energy usage being fully integrated with cannalytix™ one can visualize energy consumption in realtime and track historical usage the software’s predictive functionality also helps optimize energy use challenges proactively we believe a cultivator’s huge electric bills can be scaled back when the entire grow is looked at as a complete and fully integrated operation cannabox™  much like a bank atm the cannabox™ machine operates with the swipe of a card which will verify identity age and prescription information of a medical marijuana patient before releasing measured packages of marijuana the advantage is you will not have to be waited on by an assistant if you dont require consultation and the store location is busy the machine is capable of holding several hundred items in multiple forms of marijuana cannabox™ is a secure robotic device specifically designed for dispensing cannabis products in secure prepackaged amounts in complete accordance with state law requirements in licensed dispensaries and only to legal buyers futureworld has teamed up with american green to brand the zazzz dispensary machine with the cannabox™ logo and distribute the product across the united states and possibly worldwide presently the zazzz machine presented by american green which is first to the market medbox inc’s machine and a vending machine product by endexx corp also distribute the product the model for futureworld is to bring  units to market within a couple years in accordance with our jv goals alongside american green and its zazzz machine there will be a revenue sharing agreement with american green and futureworld for every placed cannabox™ machine via monthly leasing and transaction costs we are currently putting together the details of the jv with american green and beginning the marketing and design phase of our product revenues are purely a function of quantity at this point a monthly leasing fee of approximately  dollars a month and a transaction cost somewhere between  and  per competing brands are to look for a large upfront expenditures from dispensaries for the machines which we believe will make their sales model harder to actual achieve sales nationwide cannabox™ will be marketed exclusively through our new dispensary division dispensetek dispensetek was created to market and sell dispensary related products and services including but not limited to cannabox™ it is important to understand cannabox™ robotic dispensaries are secure delivery and control systems for use in licensed cannabis dispensaries and not “vending machines” their specific design benefits public safety governance dispensaries and consumers hemptech has also signed an agreement with colorado flower company to provide turnkey stateoftheart technology for their grow facility which is being built on our land in colorado the contract calls for m and the technology is leased at k per month for five years futureland properties llc on october   the company has

certificates of deposit that have an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents the company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents   fair value of financial instruments   the following methods and assumptions were used by the company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments         •  cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable prepaid expenses accounts payable  and  accrued expenses      the carrying amount reported in the balance sheets for these items approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments     •  loans and notes payable to related parties     the carrying value of loans and notes payable to related parties approximates fair value as

instruments approximate their historical carrying amount   accounts receivable   accounts receivable consist of amounts due for the delivery of product sales to customers an allowance for doubtful accounts is considered to be established for any amounts that may not be recoverable which is based on an analysis of the company’s customer credit worthiness and current economic trends based on

limitations on the effectiveness of internal control   our management including the president does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material errors an internal control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people andor by management override of the control the design of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances andor the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a
