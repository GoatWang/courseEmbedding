facebookcomstripepayments website wwwstripecom editors note stripe is one of incs   under  this years readers choice winner is thinklite   sometimes the most stunning changes arise from the smallest of ideas thats the origin story of stripe the payments company thats quietly eating the lunch of entrenched competitors in the  trillion global ecommerce payments industry founded in  by wunderkind brothers john and patrick collisonserial entrepreneurs who hail from limerick irelandstripe is making the digital payment process for smartphones and websites so painfree its practically invisible like many silicon valley luminaries the collisons dropped out of collegeharvard and mit respectivelyto launch their first startup an auction and marketplace management system for ebay merchants that business called auctomatic sold for  million in  to a canadian media company making the collisons millionaires when they were still teenagers  with stripe the collisons saw a bigger unfilled need which was the payments void that customers are still subject to when they buy online the market opportunity for stripe before stripe existed was obvious says john collison the companys yearold president when buying online people were forced to use outside vendors like paypal to complete a purchase that gap is where stripe fits in collison adds stripe lets merchants process credit cards directly from their own websites simply by inserting a few lines of code while that may seem incredibly minor transactions experts say it improves the payment experience by keeping customers at merchants websites and by reducing the time it takes to pay that in turn increases the likelihood customers will buy and come back to buy again you dont have that disjointed experience when you go to paypal or wherever else to input your payment information says andy schmidt research director at ceb towergroup a research firm focused on the financial services industry that small change has plenty of evangelists venture capitalist venky ganesan managing director of menlo ventures says the payments industry is ripe for the kind of disruption that stripe is promising the company is able to offer lower rates by cutting out some of the middlemen in an industry that had been controlled by the credit card companies as well as merchant issuing and merchant processing banks which each take a percentage of transactions  silicon valley is all about finding the next mark zuckerberg and i know plenty of people who put the collisons on this list says ganesan they are incredible entrepreneurs expaypalers elon musk and max levchin not to mention the everprevalent peter thiel have taken notice so too have prominent vc firms such as andreessen horowitz khosla ventures and sequoia capital collectively theyve ponied up  million valuing stripe at around  billion stripe does not release its revenue number but its likely to be a fraction of paypals which reported annual revenue of about  billion for  stripe currently supports payments in  currencies and with newly inked deals to process payments for apple pay and alibabas alipay as well as a feature that allows merchants to accept bitcoins for payments stripe has positioned itself to become a global payments phenomenon for too long people have looked at the internet with a bricksandmortar lens but that is not what the internet is about collison says there are new kinds of internet companies with new kinds of business models and thats the stuff we are interested in enabling published on apr   pavement
