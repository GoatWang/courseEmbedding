modulation using its projuvenoltm productmarketwiredjuly  reblogsharetweetshareoceanside camarketwired  jul    therapeutics solutions international inc  otc pink  tsoi  announced today the filing of a patent application covering the use of its projuvenol™ product as well as various pterostilbene compositions for use in augmenting efficacy of existing immunooncology drugs that are currently on the market the patent is based on the ability of pterostilbene one of the major ingredients of projuvenol™ to reduce oxidative stress produced by cancer cells which in turn protects the immune system from cancer mediated immune suppressionimmunooncology described by science magazine as breakthrough of the year offers the possibility of not only killing tumor cells in a nontoxic manner but also establishing immunological memory which patrols the body and destroys recurrent tumor cells while great progress has been made in developing drugs that stimulate the immune system to recognize and kill tumors a major pitfall of current approaches is that tumors produce chemicals and oxidative stress that suppresses the immune system thus limiting efficacy of immune therapies said timothy dixon ceo of therapeutics solutions international incpterostilbene which is chemically related to resveratrol has been published to possess anticancer antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities through the filing of the recent patent the company is exploring whether its lead product projuvenol™ may be useful as a nutraceutical adjuvant to conventional cancer immunotherapies timothy dixon ceo of tsoi added the importance of proper nutrition in the context of immunotherapy cannot be overstated studies on one of the original cancer immunotherapies interleukin demonstrated that efficacy was related to antioxidant content in the patients at time of therapy accordingly we are seeking through the current work to identify whether our currently marketed product projuvenol™ may be utilized as part of an integrative approach to building up the immune response of cancer patients couzinfrankel j breakthrough of the year  cancer immunotherapy science  httpswwwsciencemagorgcontentsummary    yang et al
