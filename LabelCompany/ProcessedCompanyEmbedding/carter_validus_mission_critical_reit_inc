liabilities divided by the approximate number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis calculated as of september   the “valuation date” this valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of practice guideline  valuations of publicly registered nonlisted reits issued by the investment program association “ipa” in april  the “ipa valuation guidelines” in addition to guidance from the securities and exchange commission “sec” the various factors considered by the board in determining the estimated per share nav were based on a number of assumptions and estimates that may
