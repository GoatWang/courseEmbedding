individual glass fibers made into a variety of forms it is used as a reinforcing agent for many polymer products the resulting composite material is properly known as fiberreinforced polymer frp or glassreinforced plastic grp the basic raw materials for fiberglass products are a variety of natural minerals and manufactured chemicals the major ingredients are silica sand limestone and soda ash other ingredients may include calcined alumina borax feldspar nepheline syenite magnesite and kaolin clay silica sand is used as the glass former with soda ash and limestone used to help lower the melting temperature other ingredients are used to improve certain properties such as borax for chemical resistance the raw materials must be carefully weighed in exact quantities and thoroughly mixed together called batching before melting into glass reinforced plastics more commonly known as composites are a combination of at least two physically distinct materials acting in concert by virtue of the interfacial bond between them fiberglass composites have a number of advantages over competing materials such as steel aluminum concrete and wood these advantages include the following low weight – fiberglass composites are lightweight compared to other materials therefore the weight of the component may be significantly reduced without compromising the strength of the component part installation costs including transport – the reduced weight facilitates the transport of largesized component parts in particular in addition other objects may be moved manually without special equipment or facilities favorable corrosion properties – certain compositions of fiberglass such as innofiber® cr fiberglass are corrosion resistant this is a crucial aspect for applications such as gratings on oil rigs as well as applications where the weather is a factor good chemical resistance – due to their resistance to a variety of chemicals fiberglass composites lend themselves to pipeline construction throughout the chemical industry heat resistance – reinforced plastics and thermosets in particular form a tight lattice structure during manufacturing that cannot be destroyed or dissolved even at high temperatures also they do not lose stability at extremely high temperatures durabilitylongevitymaintenance – fiberglass composites are weatherresistant and largely impervious to road salt this eliminates to need for demanding maintenance that is required for steel freedom of design – processing techniques make it possible to produce component parts with a complex geometry or relatively large size in one shot and in one piece specific mechanical properties – depending on the type and amount of fiber added the specific properties such as rigidity or strength of finished products may be adjusted in accordance with the demands of specific application purposes  innofiber® specialty glass compositions glass fibers fall into two categories general purpose and special
