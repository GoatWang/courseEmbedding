which provide our customers access to specific properties for limited stays our mh community sites and annual rv resort sites are leased on an annual basis seasonal sites are leased to customers generally for one to six months transient sites are leased to customers on a shortterm basis the revenue from seasonal and transient sites is generally higher during the first and third quarters we consider the transient revenue stream to be our most volatile as it is subject to weather conditions and other factors affecting the rv customers vacation and travel preferences sites designated as righttouse sites are primarily utilized to service the approximately  customers who have entered into righttouse contracts otherwise referred to as memberships or membership dues we also have interests in joint venture properties for which revenue is classified as equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the

at our properties managements discussion continued managing our properties to increase operating margins by increasing occupancy maintaining competitive market rents and controlling expenses we actively seek to acquire and are currently engaged in various stages of negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of additional properties which may include contracts outstanding to acquire such properties that are subject to the satisfactory completion of our due diligence review in addition to net income computed in accordance with gaap we assess and measure our overall financial and operating performance using certain nongaap supplemental measures which include i ffo ii normalized funds from operations nffo iii income from property operations iv income from property operations excluding deferrals and property management v core portfolio income from property operations excluding deferrals and property management operating results for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison and vi income from rental operations net of depreciation we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for

computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains and actual or estimated losses from sales of properties plus real estate related depreciation and amortization impairments if any and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis we compute ffo in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do we receive upfront nonrefundable payments from the entry of righttouse contracts in accordance with gaap the upfront nonrefundable payments and related commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer life although the nareit definition of ffo does not address the treatment of nonrefundable righttouse payments we believe that it is appropriate to adjust for the impact of the deferral activity in our calculation of ffo we define nffo as ffo excluding the following nonoperating income and expense items a the financial impact of contingent consideration b gains and losses from early debt extinguishment including prepayment penalties and defeasance costs c property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and d other miscellaneous noncomparable items nffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to nffo
