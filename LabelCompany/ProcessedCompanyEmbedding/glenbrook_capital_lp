as a deputy judge of the high court                     between                                           emmet coldrick instructed by swinnerton moore llp for the claimantdaniella gilbert instructed by lawrence stephens for the defendant hearing dates  june  july                     judgment i direct that pursuant to cpr pd a para  no official shorthand note shall be taken of the judgment and that copies of this version as handed down may be treated as authentic jonathan hirst qc page jonathan hirst qc  the claimant is an investment fund based in palo alta california between  and  it purchased through the defendant the sole proprietor of a silver business at the london silver vaults the silver vaults in chancery lane a large quantity of silver for investment the silver remained in the defendants custody in april  at the height of the bullion market the claimant demanded delivery of the silver by  april some silver was delivered but there is a dispute as to what was delivered to the claimant these proceedings were issued claiming an order for delivery up of the silver and damages for conversion freezing orders were granted some silver was delivered up to mr michael hore an independent silver expert on  november  for him to assess and keep in safe custody that silver was finally released to the claimant on  january   judgment was entered in default of acknowledgment of service on  november  for damages to be assessed this trial has been the assessment of damages however it has in reality been a full trial because the court needed to determine what if any silver had been converted and what had been delivered to the claimant after april  it is common ground that  troy ounces ozs of sterling silver of  purity the glenbrook silver were purchased at a cost of about £ excluding the cost of some candlesticks which was paid for by the claimant the parties cases as to what happened to the silver are as follows the claimant contends  ozs were delivered to the claimants vault no  at the silver vaults and as is now common ground a further  ozs in the form of about  spoons was given to the teenage daughter of a friend of mr wickersham so  ozs were not converted between  ozs and  ozs say  ozs were delivered to mr hore and subsequently to the claimant the difference of  ozs is dependent on the weight of silver in some items with nonsilver blades or handles the balance of  ozs has never been accounted for the defendant contends that ultimately all the silver was delivered to the claimant some was delivered as silver bars produced from glenbrook silver that had been melted down  at a case management conference held on  january  teare j approved the following list of issues what items of silverware were bought by the defendant for the claimant between  and  the items which if any of the items had been lawfully disposed of prior to the end of april   as at the end of april  what was the value of the items less the value of any items within  above which items were delivered up by the defendant to mr hore what iswas the value of the items within  above as at their time of release to the claimant which if any of the items were delivered by the defendant to the claimant or its agents after the end of april  which if any of the items were melted down into silver bars and delivered by the defendant to the claimant or its agents after the end of april  what was the value of any items within  and  above at the time of their delivery to the claimant to what if any damages is the claimant entitled what if any interest on these damages should be awardedto these issues i agreed to add one further issue on the first day of the hearing to what if any profit share was the defendant entitled the claimant was opposed to the court deciding this further issue but i considered that it arguably fell within  and that in any event it was desirable that this issue was decided now rather than being left for further argument i was satisfied i could do so justly i heard the following evidence for the claimantrichard rudgley the former president of glenbrook capital management the general partner of the claimantgrover wickersham a consultant to the claimant he is a member of the california bar and a director of a us public companypaul frankel a former employee of the claimant by witness statement onlyrobert lishman ceo of the claimant by a police statement onlyi also read statements by trudie protopapas and christine vella solicitors employed by swinnerton moore for the defendantmark hamilton he is an experienced silver dealer and has been in the business for many years hamiltons was a respected business in which his mother and brother were also involved but for some time he has been the sole proprietorrichard inglis mr hamiltons deputy until joel langford another silver dealer trading in the silver vaultscasey conway by witness statement only he ran businesses called do buy  limited and  live limited and had the facilities and equipment to melt silver flatware into barsadditionally the claimant called mr michael hore as an independent expert witness he also had factual evidence to give mr hore is the principal behind chester valuation company he had previously run the valuations department for sothebys in chester  my assessment of the witnesses was as follows mr rudgley and mr wickersham were honest witnesses doing their best to assist the court mr wickersham was inclined to ramble from time to time in his evidence miss gilbert mounted a major attack on mr wickershams credibility alleging that he had knowingly made an exaggerated claim because he had not included in his statement any reference to the  ozs silver spoons given to the teenage daughter of a friend in the presence of mr hamilton so not in any way secretly or to two of  candlesticks manufactured by the defendant for glenbrook but for mr wickershams personal use these criticisms were not well judged and i reject them the  ozs were on any basis absolutely trivial and had understandably been forgotten by mr wickersham who was not present on the occasion until he was reminded as to the two candlesticks which were ultimately paid for by mr wickersham i am satisfied that they had nothing to do with the glenbrook silver they were not manufactured from it as is evidenced by the costs invoiced by the defendant which appear to include the bullion price of the silver supplied and they were rightly not included in mr hores assessment of the glenbrook silver  mr inglis and mr langford attended to give oral evidence as a result of witness summonses issued by the claimant when it appeared doubtful whether they would be called by the defendant to accommodate their other business commitments they were called first they were patently honest witnesses doing the best they could but as they were the first to admit that their memories had diminished over the years  i had no reason to disbelieve mr conways evidence which was very limited indeed in evidence mr hamilton expressed surprise that his legal team had not asked mr conway about a range of other matters and called him to give oral evidence i should record however that in  he was convicted of cheating the public revenue and sentenced to six years imprisonment in a subsequent trial he was found by andrew popplewell qc as he was sitting as a deputy high court judge to be an untruthful witness that may explain why it was decided not to call him to continue reading request your free trial
