highest rated lowest rated rating  crystal pc fun way to pass the time although on some levels the ad on the side is annoying ive been able to just slide the screen over to get to the parts i need its simple mechanics fun a little challenging at times but not overly stressful to play which i like some added features would make game play a little more user friendly such as the different materials making different colored lines so its easier to differentiate between them after building a large complicated bridge maybe a backundo button to quickly remove the last line for unwanted lines that sometimes happen having to click the drop down menu select remove then click the line then select drop down menu again then draw to get started again gets tedious at times overall the simple graphics and animations dont bother me it gets the point across is still fun i enjoy passing the tablet between friends to see how they handle different bridge challenges there are many ways to complete each level which i like more more was this helpful yes no report contains spam or advertising contains profanity contains offensive content one person found this helpful rating  cody pc marvelous the graphics are amazing and i love the detail of the truck going through the ground its absolutely marvelous only good thing is the amount of levels but im not doing the same bridge design for  backgrounds more more was this helpful yes no report contains spam or advertising contains profanity contains offensive content rating  timothy pc good but not great cons first then you get to level  the ads on the right will block you from being able to complete the bridge unless you pay money to remove it that needs to be fixed or list game as free trial second it doesnt follow too closely to real life physics the structures that you can build will be impossible in real life to exist under their own weight but in the game will support the truck driving across therefore you need to practice to study the games own laws of physics which do change some times third the game doesnt stick to its own laws of physics throughout in one level you can use one design over a large gap but in the next map the same design might not work over a smaller gap when it should fourth once you have enough money you can cover almost all the levels up to  with just making two rows below the deck of square blocks with cross pieces in the shape of a x running through them pros good for playing if you have nothing else to do its free more more was this helpful yes no report contains spam or advertising
