back wall inside basilica of saint servatius maastricht a widely travelled diplomat and a determined prosecutor of arianism the presence of servatius is recorded at several synods and church councils in  sarbatios  greek texts rendering v as b  was present at the council of sardica modern sofia in the debates servatius represented the trinitarian view which clashed with the arian view of most eastern bishops when athanasius leader of the antiarian party was in exile in trier he may have met with servatius in trier or tongeren because both men campaigned against arian bishops and priests in the region in  at the council of cologne servatius testified against the bishop of cologne saying that he denied the divinity of jesus christ this even happened in the presence of athanasius bishop of alexandria adding to this our churches are adjacent after coemperor constans had been assassinated in  servatius was sent to the roman emperor constantius ii in edessa the capital of armenian mesopotamia as an envoy of the usurper magnentius to represent the late constans as an unworthy tyrant and oppressor in the hope of obtaining constantius recognition of magnentius as coruler the mission failed and the resulting civil war ended with the death of magnentius in  the mission can be seen as a sign of the high standing of servatius in 9 at the council of rimini sulpicius severus reports that servatius again eloquently denounced arianism an important source about the life of saint servatius albeit not a contemporary source is gregory of tours glory of the confessors and history of the franks in his late thcentury account gregory writes about aravatius identified by most scholars as servatius who was a bishop of tongeren and died in maastricht according to the frankish bishop and historian aravatius lived at the time when the huns threatened tongeren th century which does not match the thcentury dates of the synods mentioned above it is not always clear how much of gregorys account is history and how much is pious fiction gregory describes how servatius during a vigil at saint peters tomb in rome had a vision in which the destruction of tongeren was forecast because of their sinfulness peter then handed the keys of heaven to servatius transferring to him the power to forgive sins according to gregory servatius returned to tongeren brought the relics of his predecessors to maastricht where he died and was buried alongside the roman road near the bridge as a bishop servatius may have been the founder of several early christian churches in the diocese of tongeren two likely candidates are the basilica of our lady in tongeren and the basilica of our lady in maastricht in the case of tongeren this traditional claim was supported by excavations in the 9s which revealed under the medieval church remains of a thcentury church possibly the original cathedral of the diocese the origins of the maastricht church of our lady remain uncertain since no excavations have ever been carried out inside this church in another maastricht church however the basilica of saint servatius excavations in the 99s have revealed the remains of a thcentury church built by bishop monulph and described by gregory of tours as a magnum templum with at its center a late roman structure possibly the tomb of servatius legendedit the extended family of saint servatius including jesus mary john the baptist and saint anne thcentury panel treasury of the basilica of saint servatius over the centuries legends accumulated around the historical figure of the bishop of tongeren two early vitae biographies place servatius birth in armenia and make him a cousin of john the baptist and thus a distant relative of jesus neither were mentioned by gregory of tours around  the french priest jocundus was commissioned by the chapter of saint servatius to write another vita sancti servatii jocundus is also the author of the miracula sancti servatii a sequel to the vita describing all the miracles that happened after servatius death according to some historians both works were composed to quell doubts about the genealogy of servatius and his armenian descent these doubts had been raised at the council of mainz in 9 when envoys from the byzantine emperor arrived at the council of mainz confirming accounts by a certain alagrecus who had testified that servatius was armenian and asserting that his birthplace was fenuste southeast of damascus this helped to erase some doubts but servatius kinship to jesus was never confirmed by an official council at the end of the th century the poet henric van veldeke wrote a new legend of saint servatius based on the earlier accounts by gregory of tours and jocundus to which he added several more miracles thus emphasizing saint servatius saintliness the work is considered one of the earliest works of dutch literature even though it was written in limburgish the most divergent of the  major dialects that comprises middle dutch in the th century the bollandists tried to separate some of the facts and myths surrounding servatius they managed to calculate the exact date of his death  may  which for a long time was accepted as a historical fact saint servatius receives in tongeren the mitre and crozier from an angel saint servatius preaches in greek the audience miraculously understands him saint servatius baptizes attila the hun saint servatius dies in maastricht angels cover his body with heavenly cloths one of the heavenly cloths shown to pilgrims from the dwarf gallery of the basilica of saint servatius legacyedit in maastrichtedit according to tradition the saints remains are buried in the basilica of saint servatius in maastricht where they lie in a crypt dating from the th century his tomb has been a place of pilgrimage for many centuries famous visitors include charlemagne charles v holy roman emperor philip ii of spain and pope john paul ii in maastricht the orthodox church belonging to the russian exarchate of the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople is also dedicated to saint servatius the sint servaasbrug the oldest bridge over the river meuse in maastricht was named after saint servatius the name servaas was a popular given name in maastricht and surroundings for many centuries the thcentury gilded reliquary chest in the basilica of saint servatius containing the saints relics is a major work of mosan art and became known as the chest of distress noodkist as it was carried around town in times of distress a procession with the reliquary shrine still takes place every seven years heiligdomsvaart the noodkist is normally kept in the treasury of the basilica of saint servatius along with the socalled servatiana

that he denied the divinity of jesus christ this even happened in the presence of athanasius bishop of alexandria adding to this our churches are adjacent after coemperor constans had been assassinated in  servatius was sent to the roman emperor constantius ii in edessa the capital of armenian mesopotamia as an envoy of the usurper magnentius to represent the late constans as an unworthy tyrant and oppressor in the hope of obtaining constantius recognition of magnentius as coruler the mission failed and the resulting civil war ended with the death of magnentius in  the mission can be seen as a sign of the high standing of servatius in 9 at the council of rimini sulpicius severus reports that servatius again eloquently denounced arianism an important source about the life of saint servatius albeit not a contemporary source is gregory of tours glory of the confessors and history of the franks in his late thcentury account gregory writes about aravatius identified by most scholars as servatius who was a bishop of tongeren and died in maastricht according to the frankish bishop and historian aravatius lived at the time when the huns threatened tongeren th century which does not match the thcentury dates of the synods mentioned above it is not always clear how much of gregorys account is history and how much is pious fiction gregory describes how servatius during a vigil at saint peters tomb in rome had a vision in which the destruction of tongeren was forecast because of their sinfulness peter then handed the keys of heaven to servatius transferring to him the power to forgive sins according to gregory servatius returned to tongeren brought the relics of his predecessors to maastricht where he died and was buried alongside the roman road near the bridge as a bishop servatius may have been the founder of several early christian churches in the diocese of tongeren two likely candidates are the basilica of our lady in tongeren and the basilica of our lady in maastricht in the case of tongeren this traditional claim was supported by excavations in the 9s which revealed under the medieval church remains of a thcentury church possibly the original cathedral of the diocese the origins of the maastricht church of our lady remain uncertain since no excavations have ever been carried out inside this church in another maastricht church however the basilica of saint servatius excavations in the 99s have revealed the remains of a thcentury church built by bishop monulph and described by gregory of tours as a magnum templum with at its center a late roman structure possibly the tomb of servatius legendedit the extended family of saint servatius including jesus mary john the baptist and saint anne thcentury panel treasury of the basilica of saint servatius over the centuries legends accumulated around the historical figure of the bishop of tongeren two early vitae biographies place servatius birth in armenia and make him a cousin of john the baptist and thus a distant relative of jesus neither were mentioned by gregory of tours around  the french priest jocundus was commissioned by the chapter of saint servatius to write another vita sancti servatii jocundus is also the author of the miracula sancti servatii a sequel to the vita describing all the miracles that happened after servatius death according to some historians both works were composed to quell doubts about the genealogy of servatius and his armenian descent these doubts had been raised at the council of mainz in 9 when envoys from the byzantine emperor arrived at the council of mainz confirming accounts by a certain alagrecus who had testified that servatius was armenian and asserting that his birthplace was fenuste southeast of damascus this helped to erase some doubts but servatius kinship to jesus was never confirmed by an official council at the end of the th century the poet henric van veldeke wrote a new legend of saint servatius based on the earlier accounts by gregory of tours and jocundus to which he added several more miracles thus emphasizing saint servatius saintliness the work is considered one of the earliest works of dutch literature even though it was written in limburgish the most divergent of the  major dialects that comprises middle dutch in the th century the bollandists tried to separate some of the facts and myths surrounding servatius they managed to calculate the exact date of his death  may  which for a long time was accepted as a historical fact saint servatius receives
