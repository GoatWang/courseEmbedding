highquality products or services significant barriers to entry moats and low reinvestment requirements concentrated yet diversified portfolios focus on our highestconviction ideas we choose to go deep instead of broad often taking a contrarian point of view indepth sector and industry expertise informs each investment decision our portfolio managers and research analysts evaluate companies within a wellestablished circle of competence — industries where we are truly experts risk management is a top priority we define risk as a permanent loss of capital controlled at the portfolio and stock level via allocation limits our focus on private market value pmv and our indepth understanding of the companies we choose we also mitigate risk by investing with a margin of safety  discount to pmv
