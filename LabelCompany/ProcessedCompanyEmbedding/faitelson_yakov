february   the most comprehensive study on jewisharab demographics was published on january   by yakov faitelson institute for zionist strategies the study sheds light on the surge of jewish demography especially among secular israeli jews and on the sharp decline of arab natural growth and population growth as a result of a most successful arab integration into israels infrastructures of modernity no ground to the claim that jews are doomed to become a minority west of the jordan river in  there is a  jewish majority  in the combined area of pre israel judea and samaria – which

kuwaits  higher than saudi arabias slightly higher than egypts and only  and  lower than jordans and syrias  respectively   the growth in jewish fertility is driven by secular and not by religious or ultrareligious jews  since  there has been a decline in ultrareligious fertility…the surge in secular fertility is driven mainly by the olim immigrants from the former ussr…their children and

old arab women did not enroll in school   in  there were  jewish births per  arab birth  in  there were  jewish births per  arab birth   the demographic trends within pre israel are identical to those in judea and samaria…but in a much faster pace  the fertility rate of judea and samaria arabs dropped from  births per woman in  to  births in lower  than israeli arabs and substantially lower than
