of edwardsville for my checking and savings account since i was  years old they have the standard  dollar fee every month depending on how much of a minimal balance you keep in your account they have also been extremely easy to work with on overdraft fees i have had three overdraft fees that i have been able to have refunded with them by simply explaining my situation to a customer service representative their customer reps have always been polite and explained to me why i received the fee in the first place while still overturningrefunding the fee for me… read more october   · flag

required deposit and the fees the thinking here is that you are using a secured credit card to build credit standing and you don’t want to sacrifice too much liquidity or spend too much money if you can help it through this prism we will check out how the bank of edwardsville secured visa credit card measures up for starters it requires a deposit of at least  this isn’t outrageous but many secured cards only require  deposits which means the bank of edwardsville secured visa falls short in the minimum deposit category when it comes to fees the bank of edwardsville secured card charges a  fee again not terrible but not great either to see how the bank of edwardsville secured credit card stacks up let’s check out some of its stiffest competitionthe orchard bank secured credit card is typically regarded as the best secured credit card it only requires a  deposit and does not have an annual fee during the second year the same  annual fee as charged by the bank of edwardsville secured card kicks in but it generally takes about a year of responsible secured card use to qualify for an unsecured card so it should actually be a free conduit to better credit given the lower fees and the lesser liquidity sacrifice you’d have to make i’d definitely go with the orchard bank secured card instead of the bank of edwardsville secured card… read more february   · flag product bank of edwardsville secured visa® credit card comment follow share comment yesusefulno  by joeweider i’m familiar with young adult novels but i’m not quite sure i’ve ever seen a young adult credit card it’s especially weird when you consider that most people believe the card act made it significantly harder for people under the age of  to get credit cards while young adult generally means  in the literary world i’m guessing it means someone who is of college age or a bit older and is not actually enrolled so they cannot get a regular student credit card anyway why don’t we see what the bank of edwardsville young adult visa credit card brings to the table besides a unique type of branding unfortunately the bank of edwardsville young adult visa doesn’t bring much else at all to the table it doesn’t have rewards of any kind nor does it have a low introductory interest rate yes the young adult credit card does not have an annual fee either which means it’s a lowcost way to access and subsequently build credit but if you have any other options that have the same low cost as well as some other draw then it would be preferable to being a young adult at bank of edwardsvilleone example of a card that would best the edwardsville bank young adult card would be the capital one cash rewards for newcomers this card doesn’t have an annual fee either and it gives you  cash back on travel as well as  on everything else if you can get this card go for it but you’ll likely need higher income or a bit more credit history than the bank of edwardsville young adult card with either card though you’ll need either to provide a cosigner or demonstrate the incomeassets needed to make monthly minimum payments… read more february   · flag product bank of edwardsville young adult visa® credit card comment follow share comment yesusefulno  by joeweider who’s on team edwardsville well i suppose that depends on what exactly the bank of edwardsville visa signature credit card has to offer not too much it seems sure you get  bonus points after first use but that’s only good for  you also only get  point for every dollar spent with the card which is basically the industry standard base rate and is typically supplemented by much better rewards on specific spending categories the bank of edwardsville visa signature credit card also offers  on purchases and balance transfers for  months but considering the fact that you can find cards offering  on both for  months that’s not such a great dealsince you shouldn’t apply for the bank of edwardsville visa signature credit card you need to find another card to get as far as i know there’s no bank of jacobsville visa signature credit card either so you can cross that off the list the eaxact card you get really depends on your exact needs if you want rewards i go with the chase sapphire preferred which offers a  cash initial bonus or the blue cash everyday from amex which gives you  cash back at supermarkets  cash back at gas stations and department stores and  on everything else if you want a  rate go for the citi simplicity card or the citi platinum select both of which offer  for  months… read more december   · flag

depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons  banks offer safekeeping borne from fdic insurance and  banks pay interest on deposits allowing funds to grow over time banks in turn make money by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits banks can have other sources of revenue as well including investments fees on various services and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance in addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms for example banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve how do i choose a bank by odysseas papadimitriou wallethub ceo when it comes to selecting a bank the options can be overwhelming in past generations it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster these days you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an onlineonly bank that has no branch offices at all special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking introductory interest rates or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account but before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you do you need a brickandmortar location you may find yourself in need of a safedeposit box or if questions arise you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with facetoface communication if you need access to a real building staffed by live people prioritize your bank’s location and hours bankers’ hours are notoriously short and if your workday overlaps them completely you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home so that you can slip in at lunchtime or you might want to look for a bank with better hours are you a technophile you may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an onlineonly bank or bank account by the same token you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements keeping tabs on your account balance electronically and using mobile apps to locate atms that are within your network these are great opportunities and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them if your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps it helps to be realistic read through the fine print understand the fees and penalties and decide whether they work for your lifestyle do you travel abroad extensively international financial transactions have never been easier or less laborintensive and while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and atm withdrawals others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers if you’re a frequent international traveler it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market  not only will this enable you to avoid the industrystandard  international surcharge but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since visa and mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks  you should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use nor foreign atm withdrawals is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking since the global financial crisis of  the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye but the banking industry is not a monolithic entity many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development fair lending and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs these institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible  they’re worth a look at the very least what does it mean to be fdic insured by john kiernan personal finance editor if your bank is fdic insured any money you put into a deposit account along with any earned interest will be returned to you even if your bank fails there are limits of course insurance coverage tops out at  per depositor per institution—not per account as some people assume that means if you have  in a money market account and another  in a cd at the same bank you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured it’s important to note that fdic insurance covers deposit accounts only that is checking savings cds and money market accounts other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide such as annuities life insurance and mutual funds including money market funds are not insured most banks and thrifts also known as savings and loan institutions are fdic insured but a few are not by law those that are must display the fdic logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials if you don’t see the logo or if you have any doubts ask about coverage credit unions are not covered by the fdic but they do have an insurance program of their own sponsored by the national credit union administration ncua  as is the case with banks this provides coverage for up to  per depositor per institution the fdic which stands for the federal deposit insurance corporation was founded by the us government in  in response to the widespread bank failures of the great depression fdic insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers commerce other banks and the overall economy and one of the hard lessons of the s and s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank even in the face of frightening economic and

was  and a checking accwith lets say  for total of this type of acc everyday checking comes with a  monthly service fee which one of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of now as part of this checkingsavings acc is a scam called save as you go that means that every time you make some electronic transaction like paying a bill usually    or more dollars depending on the amount of the transaction will be transferred from your checking part of the acc to the saving accthe idea is that you are to stupid to manage and save your own money so wells fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savingsas a result of this scam you can find yourself in a position where you have lets say  in your savings acc and  in your

reply  · delete december   swedmusk yes you can get a loan with tarnished credit but you will have to pay a considerably higher interest rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk you should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term if your accounts have not gone past  days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep or by sending along a goodwill letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late there are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts you should begin by puling your free annual credit report from httpswwwannualcreditreportcom so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts once you have a better picture of where you credit is now you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you i would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as lexington law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own you may wish to familiarize yourself with credit good will letters and have a look at
