nov   prnewswire  the following is a letter from pergament advisors llc to the board of directors of overland storage inc november   overland storage inc spectrum center boulevardsan diego ca  attn board of directors board of directors pergament advisors llc is the investment manager of pergament multistrategy opportunities lp pergament that owns a significant economic interest in overland storage inc overland or the company  based on publicly available information pergament is a top  shareholder  since eric kelly became ceo in  the company transitioned from an oem strategy to a branded products company providing a full suite of storage systems including diskbased network attached storage nas storage area network san tapebased backup and archival solutions as well as data management software  an article this year stated overland is the only company that now has scaleout nas scaleout san block vtl and tape  excluding the earnings report released november th where management stated revenues were pushedout by european challenges we believe the company reached an important inflection point of trough revenue a year ago when overland began their new product launch  in october  overland launched its snapserver dx product followed by snapsan and recently the new scaleout nas solution snapscale cloud  we applaud managements efforts building a higher margin branded product business with accelerating growth potential from the new baseline  unfortunately overland is misunderstood and the stock is grossly undervalued  the market resists giving value to overlands successful turnaround and current high growth and margin expanding profile  at current market capitalization and adjusting for the six capital raises  during eric kellys tenure as ceo there has actually been a loss in value  the company raised approximately  million  meanwhile the current market capitalization is approximately  million  considering the company was trading at around a  million valuation when eric kelly became ceo in january  there has been an implied loss of  million  this we do not applaud  however we believe market misunderstanding has driven this value dislocation and fortunately this can be easily reversed eric kelly has experience buying and selling businesses with the most relevant transaction he led being the  purchase of snap appliances from quantum for  million  he then led the sale of that business approximately two years later to adaptec for  million  we applaud that return profile and believe a similar scenario will occur with overland if the board takes the right actions  pergament requests that overland immediately explore strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value overland is significantly undervalued and we believe the time has come to sell the company to a strategic buyer  considering the capital raised since  represents more than the current market capitalization we believe the largest shareholders especially those who were financing participants support our view  most of the financing participants were hedge funds and according to public filings and bloomberg the ten largest hedge fund holders own approximately  of the common stock  since the financing rounds ranged from  to  with a weighted average of   all of these investors are currently under water and thus we believe would most likely support maximizing shareholder value now our conviction is heightened by the last annual shareholder meeting held on june   where the chairman of the board scott mcclendon maintained his position by only a slim margin   this occurred without any publicized shareholder hostility going into the meeting  since mr mcclendon was a past ceo of overland and is the longest serving board member its clear shareholders desire change to the status quo  since hedge funds own the majority of the company we believe further change to the status quo if demanded could easily occur  it is also important to note that the clinton group clinton a known multistrategy fund with activist strategies is the third largest shareholder with  and holds a board seat  after studying their publicly filed letters to various board of directors demanding value creation we believe clintons views are aligned with ours and all other shareholders overland is worth at least  to an acquirer representing at least a  premium based on  calendar year revenue consensus of  million overland currently trades at x which is a significant discount to historical acquisition multiples in the storage sector  storage acquisitions on average have been well in excess of x revenue with several well known transactions at x  a low end range of xx revenue represents an overland valuation of  million to  million or fully diluted price per share of  to   at november th close of  the range represents premiums of  to   revenue and cost synergies to a strategic buyer give credence to the higher end of the range  we believe cost synergies drive tremendous value to an acquirer  overlands annual operating expenses are approximately  million which is primarily represented as of june   by headcount of  in sales and marketing  in research and development and  financeithr there are only  total fulltime employees  to put that in perspective a midsize technology company in the storage space netapp has headcount of approximately  in sales and marketing and  in research and development as per the  k filing  we believe all of overlands operating expenses would be redundant to a strategic acquirer increasing the attractiveness of overland as a target  based on  calendar year revenue consensus of  million  gross margin most recently announced quarter and  million of cost synergies the acquirer absorbing zero operating expenses the new overland would generate  million of operating income equating to operating income multiple range of xx based on the acquisition revenue multiple range of xx  this is extremely attractive we therefore believe the high end valuation compares favorably to historical transactions  adding to the conviction is that the analysis excludes the revenue synergies a larger sales force would realize and the gross margin expansion a larger companys manufacturing and sourcing scale would drive  the analysis also excludes the value of the patent portfolio which is potentially significant we applaud the companys november  settlement with dell and ibm in its patent infringement lawsuit against bdt ibm and dell  we also applaud the companys announcement in june  claiming infringement of one or both of the overland patents  and  involved in the international trade commission itc case against bdt  those lawsuits name as defendents quantum spectra logic pivotstor qualstar tandberg tandberg data and venture corporation  we believe the combination of the settlements with two of the largest global technology companies plus the itcs recent determination of  and  patent validity that overland possesses a strong case against all defendents in us district court of southern california  the breadth of the valid patents equates to significant monetization potential especially with patent  partitioning spanning the entire storage industry  even though overlands current market capitalization provides no value to potential settlements and royalties we believe all industry players would be interested in owning these patents  there is tremendous competitive value for a large strategic acquirer to own valid patents that span the storage industry  we believe the acquirer would have greater litigation experience and financial wherewithal to strongly pursue the pending cases and conceivably add additional defendants  it should also be clear that all current defendents could be buyers of the patents or interested in acquiring overland  any value gained by an acquirer from overlands patent portfolio would increase the acquirers return which adds to our belief that the high end valuation compares favorably to historical transactions it should be clear that right now is a very compelling time for the board of directors to maximize shareholder value and that overland is a very compelling target
