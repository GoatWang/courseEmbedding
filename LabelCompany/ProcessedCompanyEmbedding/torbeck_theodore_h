torbeck  president chief executive officer  director thanks josh and good morning – or good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today we were off to another great start this year with each passing quarter we are rapidly progressing towards our goal of transforming cincinnati bell into a growing fiberbased entertainment communications and it solutions company our highlights for the quarter are summarized on slide six and demonstrate this teams continued ability to execute on our financial and operational objectives demand for our strategic products generated  yearoveryear revenue growth and resulted in a strong adjusted ebitda totaling  million now turning to our wireless business we successfully transitioned all subscribers off our network and shutdown all business operations in april we transferred certain tower lease obligations and assets to verizon and have now started the process of decommissioning the network next to our investment in cyrusone in the past we communicated our goal was to be a patient investor and use proceeds for monetizing this asset to repay debt and improve the health of our balance sheet in april we completed the second sale of this asset for cash proceeds totaling  million in the weeks leading up to the sale cyrusone was trading at a record high and we again executed a swift and welltimed transaction we have done exactly what we said we would do and our strategy has been successful in total todate we have monetized  of our ownership in cyrusone paying down  billion in debt and reducing interest payments by approximately  million subsequent to the sale we maintained a  ownership stake in cyrusone which is valued at approximately  million and sheltered by a  million nol we remain bullish on cyrusone and well continue to be a patient investor with the goal of maximizing our shareholder value now turning back to our operational results on slide seven the future success of cincinnati bell now relies on our ability to grow our strategic revenue and translate that growth into profit strategic revenue increased  compared to the prior year and now accounts for more than  of our total recurring revenue strategic business revenue has grown by more  yearoveryear as we continue to foster relationships with our largest customers consumer strategic revenue increased  compared to the prior year demonstrating the continued demand for faster data speeds and further supports our decision to accelerate the expansion of our fioptics network during the quarter we passed over  new addresses with fioptics and the product is currently available to approximately  of greater cincinnati our fioptics highlights are presented on slide eight fioptics revenue for the quarter totaled  million which is up more than  over the prior year and penetration rates remain consistent even as we aggressively expanded our fioptics coverage our churn results for the quarter were at the lowest rates in the past  months and single family churn is approaching  in addition arpu for the quarter was up on average  compared to prior year fioptics net activations also continue to be impressive as we added more than  video subscribers and a record high  fioptics internet subs during the quarter more importantly our total internet subscriber count which includes legacy dsl customers increased sequentially even as our main competitor recently reported the highest quarterly subscriber net adds since  we compete in a constantly evolving competitive environment and any news of change creates more opportunity for us to win our share of the cincinnati marketplace regardless of the competition we believe fiber is a superior asset with longterm relevancy and our goal is to get fioptics in the hands of as many customers as soon as possible as weve communicated several times our investment decisions remain successbased and we continue to actively monitor the key metrics that drive returns especially during this acceleration process we had a tremendous start to the year and are in a great position to achieve our objectives for  now ill turn the call over to leigh to provide additional details on the first quarter results leigh r fox  chief financial officer thanks ted and good afternoon everyone as ted mentioned we are off to an exciting start to the year and our strategic investments continue to positively impact our financial results as highlighted on slide  revenue for the quarter totaled  million growing  compared to the prior year resulting in strong adjusted ebitda of  million net income for the quarter was  million including the recognition of the  million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum starting this quarter current and prior year financial results from the wireless business will be presented as discontinued operations moving to our segment results starting on slide  entertainment and communications revenue for the quarter totaled  million increasing yearoveryear for each of the past six quarters as demand for our strategic products continues to outpace legacy declines adjusted ebitda for the quarter equaled  million resulting in  margin that are in line with expectations when considering the cost absorbed from shutting down the wireless business and accelerating our fiber investment access line loss remained elevated for the quarter at  due to the high turnover of wireless subscribers and the migration of business customers from copperbased access lines to voip lines as of the end of the quarter we had  voip access line equivalents up from  a year ago adjusting for the inclusion of voip lines our total access line loss has been a consistent  over the past several quarters turning to slide  the it services and hardware segment generated revenues totaling  million for the quarter up  from the prior year as the growth in strategic managed and professional services revenue offset anticipated declines in hardware sales adjusted ebitda for the quarter totaled  million resulting in margins of  both consistent with the prior year starting on slide  we have included an update on our capital structure subsequent to the recent sale of cyrusone the completion of this transaction has not only limited our exposure and risk associated with owning a large equity investment but has also significantly increased our operational flexibility and expanded the opportunities to efficiently manage our capital structure as noted on the slide proceeds from the sale totaled  million and were used to repay our highest coupon notes decreasing interest payments by  million annually our adjusted liquidity now exceeds  million and our updated leverage ratio is  times if leverage was further adjusted to include our remaining  ownership in cyrusone our leverage would be  times well within an appropriate range moving to slide  free cash flow was negative  million and capital expenditures totaled  million in the first three months of the year during the quarter we invested  million in fioptics including  million to pass an additional  new addresses capital expenditures to increase core network capacity totaled  million and installation costs were  million in addition fiber builds for business and managed services projects equaled  million interest payments in the quarter totaled  million and cash dividends from cyrusone equaled  million for the year interest payments are now expected to total  million and dividends received from cyrusone are anticipated to be  million after considering our new ownership percentage first quarter free cash flow results included pension and opeb payments of  million as a result of stronger than anticipated asset returns and changes in regulations we now expect full year payments to total  million which should trend down to approximately  million in  in closing we have repeatedly executed on each of the milestones required to achieve our transformation and goals of creating a company with growing revenues profits and significant cash flows our first quarter results were outstanding and we are confident that we will achieve revenue and adjusted ebitda guidance for the full year this concludes our prepared remarks for todays call thanks for listening we will now turn the conference open to questions questionandanswer session operator we will go first to dave barden with bank of america david w barden  bank of america merrill lynch hey guys thanks for taking the questions just first i guess maybe ted on the line loss comments i think you were saying that the line losses have been elevated because of the wireless shutdown but at the same time looking at the totality of voip in line losses things have been kind of constant so is the expectation then as we go forward that we should be seeing kind of a net improvement both in absolute line losses and then in that combination of line in voip and then just second just to understand your comments around competition and the kind of winding down of the comcast time warner cable deal i know that you guys had a fairly aggressive game plan that you were pitching or planning to pitch during this deal i guess its probably still going to go ahead but i know you said there is opportunity here but if you could be more specific itd be great thanks theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director thanks dave thanks for the question first of all on access lines i think you got to break it out into consumer and business and if you look at consumer we had the wireless shutdown and we attributed about  subs to that shutdown which should not reoccur then we had about  that were competition driven and time warner was offering a very aggressive credit it was a  credit for a starting offer and we dont know how long that will continue but the wireless shutdown seriously is behind us on the business side churn was about  in the quarter which is up a little bit but its primarily due to the customers transferring to voip so if you look at the equivalents we total on the voip line equivalents about  as leigh said which is an increase of about  compared to a year ago so again we think it should stabilize and actually get better than what the loss has been due to the wireless on the consumer side as far as competition is concerned i mean first of all time warner is very aggressive they are a very good strong competitor they have been all along so weve learned how to compete we actually feel our product is superior and were very confident that well be able to continue to perform at the levels that we have so we see the comcast deal – it just provides us more time to buildout our fiber to more homes and it just gives us time that we needed to remain extremely competitive so we see it as a real positive david w barden  bank of america merrill lynch good all right great thanks guys operator well take our next question from frank louthan with raymond james frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc yes thanks if you could just kind of walk us through the changes in the pension and opeb be a little more clear on that that would be helpful and then ive got a follow up leigh r fox  chief financial officer hey frank this is leigh yeah so asset returns were a lot more favorable than we had planned and then with the half the changes also and then weve used a little bit of the proceeds of cyrusone to prepay pension so thats a lot of what youre hearing from us so forecasted cash impact of opeb and pension were looking at approximately  million this year dropping to  million next year frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc okay great leigh r fox  chief financial officer as long as asset returns remain solid frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc okay great and then just on the promotional activity with fioptics has that continued do you feel the need to match any of that to try and grab some market share and then walk us through what if any sort of your strategy is on trying to capture share on overthetop with any sort of streaming apps or things you might embed in your product that maybe the completion doesnt have thanks theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director well we expect time warner to continue to be competitive and were well positioned to compete directly with them so in the future we think the promotions will continue and well be able to offer something thats extremely competitive so were well set and well positioned for that leigh r fox  chief financial officer on the product side frank yeah were in constant development our cto tom simpson has a team that develops – constantly developing products and interfaces that integrate overthetop so yeah were absolutely looking at it we think different types of product offerings for different tiers of customers is what will be extremely relevant in the future and thats our goal and thats where were migrating from a product development standpoint frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc all right great thank you theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director thanks frank operator now lets take our next question from batya levi with ubs batya levi  ubs securities llc great thanks couple of questions first on the wireline revenue side growth is strong but it came down slightly on a sequential basis is that mostly due to some hits on the wireless backlog side and when do you expect that pressure to lift and second question on the arpu fioptics and video arpu were down slightly in the quarter was that also a function of the promotions you talked about or is there some timing in terms of the price increases that you pass through on the video side leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah batya on the wireline revenue yeah that was absolutely a function of the wireless some of the gap rolls in discontinued ops youre going to see some funkiness from quartertoquarter at the end of the first quarter – the first quarter of  would be the last quarter that you see that so youll see that trending out over time but yes the main issue there was that the wireless backhaul from the wireless shutdown and ill toss it to ted on the arpu theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director yeah arpu is really driven by the promotions weve offered and again remaining very competitive with time warner batya levi  ubs securities llc okay maybe if i could ask another one if you could talk a little bit about what kind of small cell buildout youre seeing in the region and if they are on your – if they touch your fiber footprint right now some of the recent fiber deals weve seen in the market had received great multiples can you talk about if there are other strategic options you would consider for your fiber asset theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director well i think weve built out  sites so far with small cells we are getting a lot of interest as far as quotes but we did win a  million deal thats over several years but there is a lot of interest that seems to be increasing over the period of time it continues to increase but we have won one order and were very well positioned within the city to win batya levi  ubs securities llc okay great thank you operator well take our next question from simon flannery with morgan stanley simon flannery  morgan stanley  co llc thank you very much nice job on the margins if i look at the annualizing q youre above the top end of your fullyear guidance and your top line is growing are there any kind of puts and takes that might impact margins in the coming quarters and then theres been a lot of talk about the future of tv verizons got their skinny bundles dish has sling tv att is scaling up how do you think about the profitability of tv the future of tv and how you position the company for that thanks theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director okay simon well thanks for the comments on the margin it is a primary focus for us to continue to be extremely competitive on margins and to do what we can to remove cost as the wireless business wound down last year we absorbed about  million of cost that is now behind us and is absorbed within the business so were going to continue to focus on cost as well as trying to drive as much price as possible i think weve said in previous calls that our margins would be in the high s we think that thats probably the low point and well do everything we can to get it up into the s in the low  margin range leigh r fox  chief financial officer hey simon this is leigh for the year really what were expecting and what we said is lower hardware for the year which will impact margin dollars and our ebitda so yeah from a trending standpoint it does look like were ending up just about the higher end of the range but were still pretty comfortable with our guidance range simon flannery  morgan stanley  co llc okay good and on the tv leigh r fox  chief financial officer from the standpoint of technology yeah look we stay abreast to all the movement in the industry obviously its like the wild west right now but we are huge believers that ultimately it comes down to having the best and biggest pipe to the home period and thats what we focus on weve got a fantastic product team fantastic technology folks looking at this we believe verizons look at a skinny bundle is probably what the customers want for the future overthetop optionality as mentioned earlier in the call and the other thing that customers want so yeah we stay abreast and on top of everything but ultimately the big pipe wins simon flannery  morgan stanley  co llc okay and youre okay with the profitability youre seeing with the content cost to inflation on the tv line product line theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director well ill be okay with it and continues to get squeezed theres no doubt about it but the ability to bundle that product with broadband is so important and so we look for other ways to take cost out as well as trying to get margin so thats where the focus is and so far weve been very successful we plan to do the same in the future simon flannery  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you operator and well take our next question from sergey dluzhevskiy with gabelli  company sergey dluzhevskiy  gabelli  company inc good afternoon guys a couple of questions if i could first tw telecom was one of your main competitors in the enterprise space in greater cincinnati area and obviously they were taken over by level  could you comment on whether you saw any changes in competitive intensity since that merger took place and whether you were seeing anything different from the combined company theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director sergey we have not seen a lot of additional competition especially in the enterprise space the thing that we have is we have excellent relationships in cincinnati with the enterprise customer base and actually were seeing growth in our largest customers so we really havent seen any strong competition from that merger at all sergey dluzhevskiy  gabelli  company inc okay and another question maybe a bigger picture question obviously fioptics is your primary growth opportunity that is in front of you and this is your primary focus but could you share your thoughts on maybe other sources of growth that you see over time that could become meaningful whether it would be cloud hosting managed services just any color on additional sources of growth theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director yeah one of the moves weve recently made is and were putting a lot of focus on is the commercial smb marketplace as we talked earlier the migration of companies from tdm to voip we lose about  points of margin  points to  points this gives us a hole that we in the past weve tried to manage down what were trying to do is develop a product line and bundle that we can then fill that hole with so we think theres a big opportunity in that marketplace and were putting a lot of focus in there to develop products such as you said to grow in that space so we think thats a big opportunity the other thing is taking those products in other regions or in other markets were in columbus louisville and indianapolis and theyre all very applicable there as well sergey dluzhevskiy  gabelli  company inc okay thank you operator well take our next question from arun seshadri with credit suisse arun a seshadri  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi everyone thanks for taking my questions just a couple is there any way you would be able to sort of look at if you look at ebitda without the wireless shutdown cost is there any way you could sort of break out sort of how much what ebitda would have been excluding that leigh r fox  chief financial officer yes we do look at arun this is leigh we do look at that currently so we do look at adjusted ebitda on trending basis for that and for the most part that gets a little bit clouded because some of the investments weve made obviously what we said in the past is as you invest in fiber the acceleration of that investment digs a bit of a hole initially but if you look at it over time i mean its declining slightly but you see it flattening out and i think when you adjust for those investments and accelerating your fiber optics it looks a lot more plausible from the standpoint of turning the corner from a profitability standpoint so a lot of what we look at is that ebitda on adjusted basis arun a seshadri  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay got it thats helpful and then as far as your bonds your senior unsecured bonds obviously callable this year later on what are your current thoughts in terms of potentially refinancing that are there any other discussions in terms of switching to between a fixed and a floating cap structure any thoughts around that thanks leigh r fox  chief financial officer thoughts around all of it were looking at it all very closely obviously with the most recent moves with the subnotes and i do want to highlight we have as of today we no longer have subnotes on the balance sheet which is a great thing for this company but yes we are looking at that right now weve got a strategy going forward were obviously keeping a very close eye on high yield market but yeah were obviously analyzing that on a weekly basis arun a seshadri  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thank you operator lets take our next question from ana goshko with bank of america ana goshko  bank of america merrill lynch hi thanks very much so on the wireless shutdown you mentioned that youre going to be taking down the cell sites from the tower that werent transferred whats the cash cost of that and i assume thats going to go through the income from discontinued operations how long is that going to last and when does that go away leigh r fox  chief financial officer hey ana this is leigh the costs are already embedded in the aro liability so this is an ongoing operation we are accelerating it a little bit we had initially planned from a cash flow standpoint this to hit over a twoyear period but what we decided from a operational efficiency standpoint was to just do it all at once and get it all done it was much more efficient and actually saved us a little bit of money but the dollars were talking are not major i believe there are around  million to  million and again its already on the balance sheet ana goshko  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then when you say accelerated it is that over a quarter two or  leigh r fox  chief financial officer no – im sorry over the year so we had initially projected to do that as slowly as possible so that  million to  million we had spread out a few years but just looking at the efficiency well shoot to have that done this year ana goshko  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then so i know you said that there was  million of leases that got transferred on april  so if we pro forma the balance sheet it would take  million off the balance sheet is that correct leigh r fox  chief financial officer yes it gets a little more complicated than that with discontinued operations and if you look at the financials i would start there and then if you have questions we could walk you through – after the call we could walk you through discontinued ops but its a little trickier than that ana goshko  bank of america merrill lynch okay so hopefully well let me just ask so then in your net debt table in your press release on the capital leases and other that went up by  million over the quarter from  million to  million and i wasnt able to tie that to the cash flow statement maybe its just me but i was just wondering what that  million increase was leigh r fox  chief financial officer the  million increase was associated with the transfer of the lease obligations the remaining lease obligations to the core business effectively ana goshko  bank of america merrill lynch okay so i am confused so ill follow up afterwards leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah well follow up afterwards ana goshko  bank of america merrill lynch okay leigh r fox  chief financial officer but the best way to think about it is – all right ana goshko  bank of america merrill lynch thanks operator well take our next question from davis hebert with wells fargo davis s hebert  wells fargo securities llc hi everyone thanks for taking the question actually leigh maybe if you could finish that thought id be curious to hear the best way to think about it is leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah so the best way to think prior to the close of the business those assets and liabilities sit in the wireless business and then effectively whats remaining – what just shifted over into the balance sheet on the core business was the remaining liability the obligation of the remaining leases and the best way to think about it its just debt right we now have a debt obligation for capital leases we have contracts on those and the way i think of it thats just debt for the core business and well pay that off over time josh do you have any other comments on that joshua t duckworth  chief accounting officer vpinvestor relations and controller yeah well so if you look at the balance sheet as of december   as presented itll be presented in the q we file in the morning those liabilities were presented as liabilities from discontinued operations at  once we shutdown wireless because theyll become the liability of the continuing operations those liabilities are moving out of disc ops as a liability and into debt on the balance sheet so that is the  million  leigh r fox  chief financial officer thats right joshua t duckworth  chief accounting officer vpinvestor relations and controller that youre seeing and the  million that ana was referring to is sitting at discontinued operations liabilities in both periods davis s hebert  wells fargo securities llc okay understood joshua t duckworth  chief accounting officer vpinvestor relations and controller we can talk offline leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah discontinued ops was pretty complex josh and the team did a good job and well go through a lot of detail in the q but if you have any questions which i have a feeling well have quite a few please call us davis s hebert  wells fargo securities llc okay and then on backhauls some of your peers have talked about the nearterm pressure as things switch from tdm to ethernet and you have a small cell contract so just kind of wonder if you could talk directionally would you expect backhaul revenue to have a positive trajectory yearoveryear over the next  months joshua t duckworth  chief accounting officer vpinvestor relations and controller yeah we think it would be slightly positive davis s hebert  wells fargo securities llc okay and then last question from me i think you had some retail stores you are keeping after the divestiture of the wireless business just curious how thats working out for you do you feel like its something you want to continue longerterm joshua t duckworth  chief accounting officer vpinvestor relations and controller yeah we have eight stores weve converted them all to fioptics stores where theyre not only selling but demonstrating our product as well as servicing for customers so every one of them is a great experience and were finding out some very good channel for sales davis s hebert  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator and that does conclude our qa session and our conference call for today we appreciate your

chief executive officer  director thanks josh and good morning everyone thank you for joining us this morning my comments today will provide a recap of our recent accomplishments and summarize our  outlook  was truly a turning point for cincinnati bell as highlighted on slide six the company grew wireline revenue on a fullyear basis for the first time since  we sold our wireless spectrum and have begun turning down those operations and we also sold a significant tranche of our investment in cyrusone using the proceeds to repay over  million of debt and we initiated the process to accelerate our fiber investments all this was accomplished while still generating positive free cash flow and achieving our fullyear financial guidance the charts on slide seven further highlight the progress we are making on our transformational initiatives strategic revenue for the year totaled  million and has increased more than  annually since  in what is now considered our core business increasing demand for strategic products has resulted in revenue growth each of the past three years more importantly revenue from fiberbased products and it solutions accounted for almost  of our recurring revenue base in  this is a mark we expect to eclipse this year on slide eight we provide an update on the wind down of our wireless operations in  after becoming ceo of cincinnati bell i communicated the need to sell our wireless business these decisions are always difficult but i firmly believe that we needed to gracefully exit a business where we would always be limited by scale and thus struggle to provide the best product to our customers in the third quarter of  we closed the agreement to sell our wireless spectrum licenses to verizon for a  million of cash in the next few months we will close our wireless operations and transfer  million of capital lease obligations and other assets to verizon i would like to commend our wireless team for their efforts this year and their commitment to cincinnati bells customers in such a challenging environment during this tough period we transitioned approximately  of our wireless subscribers to other carriers while still generating wireless adjusted ebitda of  million and free cash flow of approximately  million now turning to our cyrusone investment on slide nine in the second quarter of this year we sold  million cyrusone partnership units for  million using the proceeds to repay debt at the time of the sale its critical to show the investment community that we could play the role of both successful business operators and thoughtful investors this was a welltimed and wellexecuted transaction which not only increased our net cash flow by  million annually but it also increased cyrusones public float and alleviated much of the perceived overhang from our significant ownership subsequent to the sale the share value of cyrusone has increased by approximately  and is traded as high as  as of the end of the year our  ownership interest was valued at  million in addition we continue to maintain a  million tax nol to shelter any future gains looking ahead we will continue evaluating opportunities to monetize this investment we are encouraged by cyrusones consistently strong financial performance and their announcement yesterday to increase their dividend by  which puts the dividend yield well in line with their peers as weve stated in the past we believe that projecting any intent regarding our position at cyrusone destroys shareholder value with that said we continue to be committed to maximizing value by executing a welltimed and thoughtfully coordinated monetization plan that balances the upside growth in cyrusone with our goal of reducing leverage the completion of the wireless transaction and our strategy for monetizing cyrusone has increased operational and capital flexibility it also provides us the ability to focus on our fiber investments our fioptics suite of products is currently available to more than  of greater cincinnati and we plan to expand that coverage to between  and  over the next few years revenue from fioptics exceeding  million in  growing more than  on average each year since we launched the product in  over that same period our subscriber base has increased on average  annually and penetration has remained steady even as we aggressively increased our market coverage our goal is to get our fiber products in the hands of as many consumers as soon as possible the ongoing success of fioptics combined with our unique market opportunity gives us the confidence to accelerate our fiber investments as we progress into  our strategic objectives remain constant first we are focused on efficiently deploying our fiber network we continue to believe in the quality and longterm relevance of our fiber assets and are confident that we will provide attractive returns in addition to our success with fioptics i am also pleased to announce we recently secured a  million multiyear small cell agreement with a national carrier we believe this win is in the first step in a much broader opportunity for us as we are uniquely positioned with both networking and wireless expertise all of our investments remain successbased and we will continue to actively monitor all the key metrics that drive return second we also remain intently focused on the health of our balance sheet during the past two years we have reduced our net debt by approximately  million and reduced interest payments by more than  million we remain in a friendly interest rate environment and will continue evaluating opportunities to improve our cash flow and our balance sheet in closing  was an exceptional year for cincinnati bell and i am extremely proud of our progress we achieved our  financial guidance generated yearoveryear wireline revenue growth and produced positive free cash flow in addition we completed the sale of our wireless spectrum and paid down approximately  of our outstanding debt with proceeds from cyrusone monetization these accomplishments prove we are capably successfully transforming cincinnati bell into a fiberbased telecommunications and it company with growing revenue profits and cash flow id like to now turn the call over to leigh to provide additional detail on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our  financial guidance leigh r fox  chief financial officer thanks ted and good morning everyone as ted mentioned  was a great year for us both operationally and financially our revenue and adjusted ebitda results are highlighted on slide  consolidated revenue for the year totaled  billion a  increase over the prior year as demand for strategic products and increased hardware sales more than offset wireless and legacy revenue decline adjusted ebitda for the year was  million with net income totaling  million resulting in diluted earnings per share for the year of  fourth quarter consolidated revenue was consistent with the prior year totaling  million adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million down from the prior year primarily due to shutting down the wireless operations increased costs associated with accelerating our fiber investments and the impact of other nonrecurring expenses related to our wireline segment our segment results start on slide  wireline revenue for the quarter totaled  million up  million from a year ago fourth quarter strategic revenue for business customers totaled  million up  on strong demand for metro ethernet and voip products consumer strategic revenue was up  million driven largely by the  increase in fioptics revenue adjusted ebitda totaled  million for the quarter resulting in margins of  margins were impacted by the previously mentioned onetime expenses and in line with our expectations turning to slide  fioptics annual revenue totaled  million in  and the product is now available to  addresses or  of our market we ended the year with  fioptics internet subscribers up more than  compared to the prior year as customers continue to demand faster internet speed we also ended  with  video subscribers up more than  compared to the prior year fioptics arpu by product increased on average  compared to a year ago as video arpu totaled  and internet arpu totaled  during the quarter churn continues to remain relatively constant and penetration rates have remained strong even as we have continued to aggressively build out our fiber network and scale our operations moving to slide  the it services and hardware segment generated revenues totaling  million for the quarter up  million from the prior year on higher than anticipated hardware sales strategic and managed professional services revenue totaled  million an increase of  adjusted ebitda and operating income both – were both up  million compared to a year ago adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was  which is consistent with the prior period slide details our cash flow results for the year we generated  million of free cash flow in  cash flow was impacted by capital expenditures of  million interest payments of  million and pension and postretirement payments of  million looking forward to  we expect interest payments to decrease by approximately  million and pension and postretirement payments to remain flat in addition cyrusone announced that would increase its dividend  to be more in line with its peer group as a result if we maintain our current ownership level in  we would expect to receive  million in cash dividend turning to slide  capital expenditures totaled  million for the year coming in at the lowend of the communicated range in  we invested  million on the construction of fioptics passing  addresses we also invested  million in installation and  million to support other platform and it enhancement as well as network upgrades to support additional traffic for both residential and business customers capital expenditures for successbased fiber builds business and managed services projects totaled  million as noted on this slide our goal is to pass  additional homes with fioptics in  we expect construction costs to be between  million and  million next year to achieve this goal in addition we are forecasting installation cost to be approximately  million we also expect to invest  million in platform and it enhancements and continued upgrades to the core network to support increased traffic our strategic capital investments are expected to be in the range of  million to  million for other projects including capital required to deploy small cell as a part of the agreements mentioned earlier during teds comments in total  capital expenditures are expected between – to be in the range between  million and  million our  guidance is presented on slide  we expect revenues of  billion in line with the current year results excluding wireless  revenues will be impacted by a forecasted decline in nonrecurring hardware sales as we do not expect to repeat the success we experienced in  with the sale of these lower margin products we are forecasting adjusted ebitda of  million plus or minus  inclusive of costs being absorbed as a result of shutting down the wireless business costs associated with accelerating our fiber investments and the impact of declining hardware sales as noted on slide  as highlighted on todays call the investments we are making in our strategic products will be the catalyst for driving future revenue growth increased profitability and – increased probability and producing significant cash flows our goals this year center around efficiently executing our fioptics acceleration plan and evaluating market opportunities to improve the health of our balance sheet im confident in our strategy and our continued ability to successfully transform cincinnati bell under a growing fiberbased entertainment and it solutions company this concludes the prepared remarks for todays call thank you for listening we will now turn over the conference to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and well take – well take our first question from batya levi with ubs batya levi  ubs securities llc great thank you you – i wanted to ask you about the wireline revenue expectations you had very solid growth in  and looking into  i know theres going to be some headwinds as you see pressure from wireless backhaul revenues but what are your thoughts of wireline revenues in general do you think that as you balance more fioptics adds and the pricing pressures that youre seeing could we still expect that to continue to grow and on the fioptics can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment you brought on more homes through this footprint but the net adds fell somewhat sequentially what were some of the drivers of that and as you look out to bring on about  more homes what is your expectation for take rates for next year thank you theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director okay first on the wireline revenue we continue to see growth opportunities in  so we expect still to see additional growth in our numbers so what is it – thats  leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah yeah we expect consistent wireline growth obviously we – its a – even with the wireline its a competitive – you see competitive pressures both on the consumer and the business side so were balancing a lot of the same inputs into both businesses which is basically a transition from tdm to sipbased or ipebased technologies but so far weve been able to overcome that especially on the consumer side with our investments in fiber which is also helping on the business side so yeah we definitely – we expect fairly consistent growth theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director on the competition side time warner has definitely gotten more aggressive weve seen that especially in the dsl the lowerend lower meg customers that we have weve seen a lot more aggressive actions from them but were doing very well our penetration rates are holding when we open a neighborhood we do extremely well and were seeing good followup as we go back to resweep the neighborhood as well so were seeing a real positive response from our customers leigh r fox  chief financial officer and on your fioptics question on take rates the take rates are fairly cyclical during the year were not seeing anything that is alarming at all so things remain consistent penetration rates remain very solid so we expect continued momentum batya levi  ubs securities llc okay thank you operator and well take our next question from simon flannery with morgan stanley simon flannery  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you very much im staying on fioptics your internet adds on fioptics were about x your tv adds whats going on there is that cordcutting that were seeing or is that just say some markets you went out with double play rather than triple play and how that plays into maybe over the top of your thoughts about that and then on the capex guidance i think you had install capex up about twothirds to  million is that a good proxy for what your kind of gross fioptics adds are going to be yearoveryear in  thanks theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director yeah well one of the initiatives is really to get out there quicker with the internet because of the need for speed so we have put a strong emphasis on that and thats why youre seeing that increase in internet adds the other piece on – overthetop is we still feel that that is going to be a – its definitely growing but its still a relatively small number and we feel that by putting the best pipe to the home or the business absolutely is the thing to do and thats what were really focused on doing you still are going to need the largest fastest pipe and thats where were focused leigh r fox  chief financial officer simon the plain answer to your question on internet is exactly what ted said we shifted some operations because we had some bandwidth and we saw the demand in internet so we shifted some tech time and focused on installing internet and squeezing some windows and we saw a really strong response to that at the end of the year but – and it had – i think it had a lot more to do with that than any kind of macro trends simon flannery  morgan stanley  co llc and on  the installed capex leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah i think to your point yeah i think it is indicative of what you should expect theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think its very relative to  well see basically the same simon flannery  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you operator and well take our next question from barry mccarver with stephens incorporated barry l mccarver  stephens inc hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions ted you mentioned your cable competition was targeting i guess a lower bandwidth customer but just curious any more color on what competition is doing in front of that the big pending merger theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director yeah i mean theyre – time warner is definitely being aggressive to get as many subs as they can well win a customer and they try to go back to them and offer a lower price but again as you can see by our growth and the penetration rates were being very successful and the other – theyre doing things like not doing credit checks which to us is not the way we want to run it so but we think we got a better product we know we have a better product and were winning in the marketplace so leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah you definitely – barry you definitely saw some predeal fervor in the fourth quarter and as ted mentioned we still came out with excellent results so we feel like it just over emphasized our ability to compete even in a toughening environment but we do think its kind of predeal items and so this is probably – i dont know the worst well see it from a competitive standpoint in behavior barry l mccarver  stephens inc is cincinnati bell thinking about any marketing campaigns around this merger to highlight whats going to happen to those customers theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director you mean their customers barry l mccarver  stephens inc right theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director time warner customers barry l mccarver  stephens inc yeah yeah im sorry – time warner customers theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director well we have a huge push on customer experience and thats the – were putting a big push on gig service as well and a lot of communication around that we have a big campaign about light up cincinnati where were putting wifi at all the public places in cincinnati were going to have an app that comes out that will enable customers like the zoo cincinnati zoo that they can push forward information to customers and make the customer experience a lot better and were looking at other public venues to do that as well so basically were very proud of the product we have and were pushing the strengths of it and thats speed which is what the customers want barry l mccarver  stephens inc very good and then on your capex slide i think it was slide  you guys mentioned an opportunity for small cell deployment is there anything specific on the drawing board there for  theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director well as ive said we won a significant – we had a significant win in the fourth quarter with a large carrier that were very excited about and theres a lot of opportunities going forward and barry the interesting thing is the fact that we have wireless expertise is a big plus in winning these small cell so weve actually transferred wireless engineers over to the carrier market business and its been very successful as they speak the same language as these carriers its been very very successful barry l mccarver  stephens inc i got you theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director so were going to be aggressive there barry l mccarver  stephens inc good that sounds good and then just lastly i guess in relationship to potentially selling some more cone stock – sorry somebody has to ask on every call right theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director yeah barry l mccarver  stephens inc i know your thought process was to wait a little bit longer and maybe take on some more debt i think that discussion happened with cone a lot lower than  but im just kind of curious as to what opportunities to pay down debt if it makes sense here in  exists if any theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director well again were very pleased i think its paid off that we are a patient investor and we havent jumped to sell and we still think that their performance continues to get better and better and the increasing dividend is also a big plus so again were going to play the role of a patient investor were going to do the right thing for our shareholders and optimize and maximize the return that we can get with that investment leigh r fox  chief financial officer but to your point barry we have a few debt milestone this year that were focused on and paying special attention to sub notes drop from  million to  million and change on march th and then the senior bonds become callable in october of this year and as you get closer to that the mpes of refinancing and looking at different options become a lot more attractive so were paying a lot of attention to the capital structure this year and were extremely focused on it barry l mccarver  stephens inc great thats very helpful thanks guys theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director thanks barry operator and well take our next question from sergey dluzhevskiy with gabelli  company sergey dluzhevskiy  gabelli funds llc good morning guys theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director hi sergey sergey dluzhevskiy  gabelli funds llc ive a couple questions – hi – if i could so on cone obviously you have indicated that your plan is to be a patient investor and you would monetize it in a very thoughtful and welltimed manner with a focus on reducing leverage and i was wondering if you see any opportunities to accelerate the realization of value from your cone investment via financial engineering that would allow you to maybe highlight the value of your stake or realize a portion of the value sooner while still leaving an option for you to benefit from potential upside in cone for example i dont know if you see creation of a tracking stock or a leverage tracker as viable options and any other thoughts on financial engineering that potentially would not preclude you from following a strategy but could accelerate or enhance the value of your cone stake realization leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah hey sergey yeah weve looked at pretty much every scenario that i and others could think of including many of the banks could think of with respect to different options and creative financial engineering the issue with that is and even at the current float these are options that are probably just impactful on the periphery of what we do there are still options but they dont really move the needle much so there are definitely options in our bag of tricks that we continue to look at on an active basis but from the standpoint of really moving the needle either with us or cone we dont feel like its – there are really that many options that are really going to move the needle and highlight the value but we continue to look at it and as we mentioned in both ted and my scripts its a big part of what were doing this year weve got a very major focus on it and are working with all of our partnership banks on different scenarios hope thats helpful sergey dluzhevskiy  gabelli funds llc yeah it is and in terms of – i mean this is related question and obviously its also related to your focus on debt pay down but if you could share your thoughts on what the right balance should be between returning cash to shareholders and deleveraging and given your focus on deleveraging at what point do you think buybacks would become a more viable tool for you guys leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah i think in the shortterm sergey were obviously focused on delevering as we stated in the past buybacks are definitely an option and theres always a balance as we look at it between where our stock price is trading and where we believe the intrinsic value is versus debt pay down weve mentioned certain restrictions on how much cash we could use for different items and to be honest its a little restrictive right now but thats part of what were looking at when we build plan for the overall capital structure is timing for more shareholder friendly returns on cash so its definitely a part of the planning cycle that were going through right now and – but i would say in the shortterm its going to be about repaying debt and getting some of the restrictions taking care of and getting i guess a healthier balance sheet a more normalized look at leverage sergey dluzhevskiy  gabelli funds llc right and last question you mentioned that time warner is going hard after your dsl customers because theyre obviously the most vulnerable i was wondering how are you planning to address the parts of the footprint that you probably wont be able to reach with fioptics obviously fioptics is a focus but those  or  of the footprint where you are able to have dsl what kind of strategy you have those markets and are you planning to raise speeds and in the shortterm i guess what is your immediate response to time warner going after those customers leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah right now our focus is to build out the fiber footprint as fast as possible i mean thats the easiest way to hit the main part of the base that we can address but to your point theres always going to be customers kind of – on the outskirts that it doesnt make economic sense to build our fiber and were looking at – were already looking at a few options through our cto and some of the work that his groups are doing pair bonding is an option in some cases were also looking at possible wifi technology and how much speed you could drive through wifi into various neighborhood so yeah were definitely looking at it it is a part of addressing that if we can get to  its addressing that  we cant get to so were not ignoring it were thinking through it and by the time we get there we do think well have some potential viable options that will bring attractive returns but its a little early on to kind of be too firm on that since the technologies are still being explored and are shipping on us also sergey dluzhevskiy  gabelli funds llc thank you operator well take our next question from david barden with bank of america david w barden  bank of america merrill lynch hey guys thanks for taking the questions i guess two if i could just first with respect to the ramifications of the wireless winddown do you think that thats had any kind of maybe nearterm disruptive effect in the wireline side of the business that might moderate into the first couple quarters of  and the second question would be kind of looking at the wireline segment is it possible leigh to give us some sense as to the relative margin contributions for the various big buckets in terms of say the business margin relative to the consumer fioptics margin relative to the kind of nonstrategic wireline margin just so as these businesses are moving around we could kind of get an understanding how the margins will be tracking going forward thanks theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director well david these are good questions the first – we definitely think there was some impact of the wireless winddown on the wireline business that will subside in basically end of february as most of our customers leave it has had an impact on access lines and we think that that with that – as transfers happen we have lost customers that necessarily werent looking to leave us so we do think that will subside and this is probably the last month that we will see an impact of that leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah on your margin question david yeah i mean i think we stated in the past that we expect aggregate margins to begin to fall in line with what you saw in the fourth quarter though the fourth quarter was impacted by a few onetime things that werent fioptics related but we do expect things to continue to compress i think we stated in the past that we expect in the highs and especially as youre growing and youre spending a lot of money and focus on growth and installation i think the real question is where does it normalize we believe it probably normalizes a little higher as you become more efficient in running a business that youre not running so hard at installation and growth on so i think what we stated in the past is still pretty accurate from the standpoint of where we think margins will lay out and obviously if we see any different well update you as that comes but we see nothing thats changed from an aggregate basis on wireline david w barden  bank of america merrill lynch and just as a quick followup leigh i guess just number one could you just kind of elaborate a little bit on kind of the relative margin of kind of the legacy business versus consumer fioptics versus business and then the onetimers you mentioned in the q that kind of hurt the margins id love to know more about those too leigh r fox  chief financial officer yeah so ill start with the latter the onetime items were just items that we accrued for in order to be fairly conservative for things that we saw coming thats all i really want to say about it but they had an approximate  million to  million impact on ebitda in the quarter on the relative margins as much as id love to give you a straightforward answer theres really not a straightforward answer on relative margins between the legacy business and the fioptics business part of what we continue to battle on a daily basis is effectively managing two businesses on a single platform and managing the shipping of costs between a legacy declining business and a growing strategic business around fioptics ive looked and heard everything from the legacy business is at  margin which i dont believe by the way when you fully allocate to the fioptics is lower so its definitely a balance the best way to really describe it is in the terms that weve described it to you we really do believe that youll see pressure but we are constantly focused on shifting costs out of the legacy business and shifting those over to the growth business and i think thats probably the best way to think about it right now any kind of relative margins i could give you would be a little bit of a high level guess at this point david w barden  bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks guys operator and well take our next question from frank louthan with raymond james frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc okay great thank you back to the small cell opportunity i would assume that this opportunity might expand a little outside your footprint where youve done wireless or where you have some other network possibly to dayton and can you give us an idea of the number of rfps that youve got that youre currently bidding on and are these carriers providing you sort of upfront capital to help build these at all theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director thanks frank thanks for the question first of all yes we do get several bids that were working on and when i say several its more than three that were looking at possibly that were bidding on many of them are outside – carry outside our normal territory and we also think this is a big opportunity in the future and were looking at how we can even expand it even further were pretty excited about it – the opportunity and again i dont underestimate that we have expertise that our strong competitors dont have and thats having the wireless experience and expertise as well so that really does carry a lot of weight with the people that were competing against frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc okay great and then should we think of  as sort of a peak capex year i mean i guess even sort of excluding other small cell type builds andor kind of successbased type contracts you might get when should we think of capex sort of peaking here theodore h torbeck  president chief executive officer  director yeah were not going to expand on  but we did say over the next few years that well be getting to  to  of the city covered and thats really the main driver for the increase in capex but again i want to emphasize this is extremely success based and if we reach a point in time where were not getting the returns were going to pull back so we think thats why we got a estimate of  to  somewhere in that range we feel that were going to reach the point where its not given us the returns that we want and were going to pull back on the capital spend frank garreth louthan  raymond james  associates inc okay great thank you operator ladies and gentlemen that does
