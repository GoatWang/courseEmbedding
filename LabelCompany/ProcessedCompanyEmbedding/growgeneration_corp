and shovel plays are essential parts of the industrys growthgrowgeneration otcqbgrwg is a top company to follow and possibly own in the marijuana legalization sector with strong samestore sales growth expansion into new markets and an aggressive growth strategy growgen for short the company stands out as a “pick and shovel” play in one of the nation’s fastest growing industries with recent expansion into two new states and planned expansion into three additional states growgen will soon be serving the needs of marijuana growers in seven states although not currently profitable the company has reported a quarterly profit in the past and the balance sheet checks out as clear these factors make growgen a must follow and perhaps a must own for investors in the marijuana legalization industry unless otherwise linked all data and information for this article was obtained through the otc markets website growgen sell real legal products the marijuana industry is only legal on a state level while the federal government still classifies marijuana as an illegal drug the federal status creates many hurdles for companies trying to operate in the industry not the least of which is a lack of access to banks selling marijuana is still a crime in the united states therefore i prefer to focus my attention on so called “pick and shovel” plays a term i recently learned in the comment to my article on kush bottles another legalization company pick and shovel plays are so named because of the california gold rush in the mid ’s one might not have made any money prospecting for gold but those selling picks and shovels made a lot of money one set of companies grows distributes or sells marijuana to the public another set of companies provides products and services to the first set of companies the companies dealing with actual marijuana are legal in some states but illegal federally the second set the picks and shovels are completely legal both at a state and federal level growgen is in the completely legal category and the products the company provides are essential products within the industry although growgen’s products are necessary for the industry there is nothing proprietary about the company’s products the company has stated repeatedly in press releases there are over  hydroponic stores in the us while growgen has a mere  stores most of these stores are going to carry similar products and there currently is no one brand or product which dominates a fractured market however few companies will have the deep pockets of a publicly traded company raising money through equity like in the case of growgen so why is there a need for such a store why not just plant some seeds in a field fertilize the plants and make sure they have water what is the big deal with these specialized stores the answer is fairly simple growing marijuana is a complicated process for most plant based products humans consume the fruit of a plant but with marijuana humans are after the flower instead seeds are the “fruit” of the marijuana plant and do not contain the desired chemicals which marijuana users seek seeds are not smoked as they give off a foul taste and odor when burned so the presence of seeds devalues the crop marijuana plants are either male or female and the males do not grow the flowers desired by users rather males grow pollen sacks and must be killed off to prevent seeds from growing in the flowers of the female plants additionally if plants are grown from seed each female plant will produce slightly different qualities and cause an inconsistent end product therefore marijuana is generally grown using a mother plant with known characteristics and then cloning the mother plant to produce many plants with an identical end product so just to start a commercial crop there are specialized products and equipment such as clone domes clone gel and other chemicals to induce root growth in clones these are not the kinds of products found at walmart or home depot because of the desire for consistency and to avoid pollination by male plants high quality marijuana is usually grown indoors the idea of fields of marijuana is a little bit far fetched and not likely to be a common sight in commercial operations although there are outdoor growers thus a grower has to provide all aspects of a plant’s needs in an indoor setting advanced lighting products timers carbon dioxide generators watering systems fertilizers and many other accessories are needed to create an ideal indoor growing operation again these products are not found in traditional department stores or home improvements stores traditional mom and pop green houses are also not likely to carry products needed in marijuana growing operations due to the above factors companies like growgen exist in their own retail category called hydroponic stores the term hydroponic refers to the lack of actual dirt used in the growing operations instead of a plant growing in dirt inside a pot a large percentage of marijuana is grown without actual dirt instead the roots are either suspended in air and constantly misted or grown in an alternative medium utilizing flowing or dripping water the water contains an ideal mix of nutrients and is constantly circulated through the room full of plants often the nutrients are catered to the specific variety of marijuana and the specific week in the plant’s growth cycle with all of the complexities of marijuana cultivation hydroponic stores need to be staffed with knowledgeable sales representatives and face little competition from other retailers growgen operates in a highly specialized retail environment growgen’s rapid expansion most brickandmortar retailers have been challenged in the last ten years and indeed there has been a rash of bankruptcies online retailers have quickly taken a large share of the retail space however there are specialty retailers still in growth phases and able to exist despite the online competition hydroponic stores are undoubtedly specialty retailers and the law actually helps the physical stores versus online competition since marijuana is illegal at the federal level commercial growers are unable to establish bank accounts nor are the end marijuana retailers business is conducted in cash in many instances with no access to credit cards purchasing products online for a grow operation is not feasible for the legalization industry brickandmortar stores have a unique advantage over online stores at the end of  growgen had six stores and in  the company expanded to ten stores currently the company has  stores with  existing hydroponic stores in the us there is ample opportunity for the company to expand through acquisitions another aspect of the company’s expansion is the increase in the number of states served the company began operation in colorado where nine stores are currently in operation then the company expanded to california with two current stores now the company has also added a store in nevada and washington each state also has a distribution center which will facilitate additional expansion plans in each region the most recent acquisition in washington highlights some of the core concepts currently in place for hydroponic operations the store is only six years old and had an annual run rate of  million in sales in the acquisition press release mr lampert ceo of growgen states by leveraging the established brand presence along with our proven model we are confident we can at least double sales in this region over the next year… we are expanding the sales organization to target the large number of commercial growers in the region in addition we will improve profitability of the operation by taking advantage of our scale volume purchasing power and our growing outside sales organization the seattle store is a newer retail location and can realize improved margins by joining the growgen team while also rapidly increasing sales the company retained existing staff and the former owner will stay on with the company as a salesman to try and capture additional commercial growing accounts the company states the current operation serves only  of the  commercial growers in the northwest one can easily see the growth potential of growgen as illustrated by this latest acquisition the company’s main objective is to aggressively grow existing stores by acquiring additional commercial accounts at each store and to also expand into different markets the number of regions where the company operates store count sales and samestore sales have all been a boon for the company as the company scales up at the and corporate level both gross and net margins should expand with the increasing economies of scale all this expansion should bode well for future earnings and help to support a longterm investment thesis growgen by the numbers for the most part i do not look into companies unless the company is currently profitable with growgen i take an exception the company was profitable for one quarter of  and one quarter of  but has not had a trailing twelvemonth’s profit yet the net loss is mostly due to the company’s rapid expansion that said the net loss is not too terrible for such a rapid expansion in the trailing twelve months the company lost  on sales of  million gross profit was  which is a decrease from previous levels the company explains this decrease as an increase in commercial accounts which bring in a much larger amount of sales but also come with lower gross profits a chart of the reported history of company sales is clearly up and to the right the company expanded sales from  million to  million in the same period or a  increase in sales the sales increase was not only driven by a higher store count but in the most recent quarter samestore sales increased  in the retail industry samestore sales growth of  is quite astounding no matter the industry the company predicts  million in sales for the full year of  which would be an  increase in sales in retail there are few industries where such great growth is achievable but the legalization industry is itself a new industry and therefore can support such rapid increases the growth though has come at a cost to shareholders the first share count i have found was  million at the end of  at the end of march the company had  million shares issued and outstanding and the share count has increased with every reporting quarter additional capital raises will likely drive the share count significantly higher in the near future until operations are able to support the company’s expansion even more confounding for investors is a new share count of  million shares as of june th and an offering by existing shareholders of  million shares essentially many early investors are selling out this will increase the liquidity of shares which in the short term may be a big negative but in the long run may be beneficial as to how the shares trade certainly this will allow larger shareholders to take a larger stake in the company down the road the capital raises are a necessary evil for growgen although share dilution is not ideal this form of capital raise is better than a debt offering from my perspective negative cash flows from operations were nearly  million in the most recent quarter but the silver lining here is an outflow of  for inventory again this is part of the rapid expansion of the company cash flows are likely to be negative for some time if given a choice i would much rather see a company raise cash through equity than taking on large amounts of debt although the numbers with the exception of sales are not pretty such numbers are expected from a company in the early stages of what should be a massive expansion at some point there will be a critical mass reached where the company can fund expansion through operations but until then sales are likely to look great and other balance sheet and income statement items are likely to be bland to ugly growgen has many risk factors as with any legalization play the number one risk is a crackdown by the federal government currently the federal government has not taken a hard stance against companies and consumers in states where marijuana is legal however if the federal government should crack down on this industry companies like growgen will quickly cease to exist sure what growgen does is completely legal but the end consumer for the most part operates illegally there will still be a market for the same products even if the government stance should change but commercial scale operations would cease to exist and only small black market operations would survive the smaller operations would not be enough to support the current hydroponics industry and without a doubt the rapid growth of growgen would come to a halt nothing about growgen is proprietary there are many distributors of hydroponic equipment and there are no dominant brands in the market in this sense legalization at a federal level becomes a risk if box retailers can find a way to enter this market the smaller operations will face significantly more competition currently the quasilegal status has kept the larger corporations out of the legalization market for investors the immediate risk is the recently filed prospectus for existing shareholders to sell up to  million shares this will undoubtedly increase the liquidity and in all likelihood will drive down the price of shares since the company trades on the otc market increased liquidity may be a difficult challenge for investors as larger institutions will not readily buy shares of otc companies shares on this exchange are often subject to wild price swings large spreads between the bid and ask and lots of share price manipulation but if the company should uplist in the future the increased liquidity may be absorbed by institutional investors conclusion at monday’s closing price of  a share the company is valued at around  million or roughly twice predicted  sales with no profits and the constant threat of dilution there is little support for this price or any other price however this is mostly based on past or known information the unknowns of the future are what make this company a potentially attractive buy if the company is able to expand to    stores over the next few years the economies of scale will likely phase out the need for additional equity raises as profits begin to appear on the bottom line although i do not see the company making a profit in  i could see the bottom line turn positive in  especially the second half an investment in the company now is an investment in the future growth prospects of a small and aspiring company myself i would not be buying shares until after the  million share offering has cleared and are out in circulation but after the offering shares at a lower price would indeed seem attractive there are very few publicly traded companies in the marijuana legalization sector which are completely legal growing rapidly and which have not taken on a lot of debt growgeneration is a standout in this space and as the industry matures the company is poised to be a top investment idea for years to come disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks
