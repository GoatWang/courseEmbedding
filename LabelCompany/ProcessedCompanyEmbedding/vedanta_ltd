survival international amnesty international and niyamgiri surakshya samiti because of the companys operations in niyamgiri hills in orissa india that are said to threaten the lives of the dongria kondh people who populate this region the niyamgiri hills are also claimed to be an important wildlife habitat in eastern ghats of india as per a report by the wildlife institute of india as well as independent reportsstudies carried out by civil society groups in january  thousands of locals formed a human chain around the hill in protest at the plans to start bauxite mining in the area the union environment ministry in august  rejected earlier clearances granted to a joint venture led by the vedanta group company sterlite industries for mining bauxite from niyamgiri hills vedantas alumina refinery in lanjigarh was criticised by the orissa state pollution control board the statutory environmental regulation body for air pollution and water pollution in the area according to amnesty international local people reported dust from the plant settling on clothes crops and food vedanta officials claimed there was no dust pollution from the plant at all an environmental inspection of the plant reported water pollution by the plant including increasing the ph value of the river vamshadhara below the refinery and a high level of spm in the stack emissions in october  it was reported that the british government has criticised vedanta for its treatment of the dongria kondh tribe in orissa india the company refused to cooperate with the british government and with an oecd investigation it has rejected charges of environmental damage saying it may be related to the increased use of fertiliser by farmers it was reported in august  that villagers in chingola zambia

in  by indian nongovernment organisations led by the peoples union for civil liberties to the supreme court subcommittee regarding the potential environmental impact of the mines the ministry of environment and forests received reports from expert organisations and has submitted its recommendations to the supreme court the subcommittee has found blatant violations of environmental regulations and grave concerns about the impact of the niyamgiri mine on both the environment and the local tribal population the committee recommended to the court that mining in such an ecologically sensitive area should not be permitted human rightsedit in february  the church of england decided to disinvest from the company on ethical grounds according to the indigenous rights organisation survival international the church’s decision is extremely unusual as it almost always prefers a policy of constructive engagement’ to disinvesting the director of survival international stephen corry said the church’s unprecedented and very welcome decision sends a strong signal to companies that trample on tribal peoples’ rights we will not bankroll your abuses anybody that has shares in vedanta should sell them today if they care about human rights vedanta responded by expressing disappointment at the churchs actions and that it is fully committed to pursuing its investments in a responsible manner respecting the environment and human rights the ngo amnesty international has also criticised the companys record on human rights it has said it is clear that vedanta resources and its subsidiaries  have failed to respect the human rights of the people of lanjigarh and the niyamgiri hills adding the proposed bauxite mine  threatens the survival of a protected indigenous community  however these risks have been largely ignored and consultation with and disclosure of information to affected communities have been almost nonexistent following this controversy several shareholders have joined in selling their shares because of human rights concerns this includes the joseph rowntree charitable trust the marlborough ethical fund millfield house foundation and pggm the british and norwegian governments have both condemned the project and martin currie investments has also disinvested following pressure from survival the bp pension fund has reduced its shareholding over similar concerns the economic times criticised the project in an editorial stating that if the mine goes ahead it will impoverish a defenceless populace perhaps to extinction on july  the chief secretary of the indian state of orissa ordered a new investigation into the rights of the dongria kondh tribe affected by vedanta resources bauxite mine in what survival international characterised as the third major blow to vedanta in a month the announcement came two weeks after the indian minister of environment and forests ordered an investigation on the same topic a government investigation published in march concluded that vedanta’s mine ‘may lead to the destruction of the dongria kondh’ a fourmember panel set up by government of india in the ministry of environment and forests investigated the bauxite mining proposal over niyamgiri near lanjigarh in the districts of kalahandi and rayagada in orissa the area has been traditional habitat of two particularly vulnerable tribal groups the dongria kondh and the kutia kondh the committee submitted its report on  august  saying the vedanta company has consistently violated the forest conservation act fca the forest rights act fra the environment protection act epa and the orissa forest act in active collusion with the state officials allowing mining  by depriving two primitive tribal groups of their rights over the proposed mining site to benefit a private company would shake the faith of the tribal people in the laws of the land  based on a panel report the government of india has served a show cause notice on the company on why its stage i environment clearance should not be cancelled legal violationsedit in july  sterlite industries a subsidiary of vedanta group was slapped a tax notice of about ₹ billion us million and charged

survival international amnesty international and niyamgiri surakshya samiti because of the companys operations in niyamgiri hills in orissa india that are said to threaten the lives of the dongria kondh people who populate this region the niyamgiri hills are also claimed to be an important wildlife habitat in eastern ghats of india as per a report by the wildlife institute of india as well as independent reportsstudies carried out by civil society groups in january  thousands of locals formed a human chain around the hill in protest at the plans to start bauxite mining in the area the union environment ministry in august  rejected earlier clearances granted to a joint venture led by the vedanta group company sterlite industries for mining bauxite from niyamgiri hills vedantas alumina refinery in lanjigarh was criticised by the orissa state pollution control board the statutory environmental regulation body for air pollution and water pollution in the area according to amnesty international local people reported dust from the plant settling on clothes crops and food vedanta officials claimed there was no dust pollution from the plant at all an environmental inspection of the plant reported water pollution by the plant including increasing the ph value of the river vamshadhara below the refinery and a high level of spm in the stack emissions in october  it was reported that the british government has criticised vedanta for its treatment of the dongria kondh tribe in orissa india the company refused to cooperate with the british government and with an oecd investigation it has rejected charges of environmental damage saying it may be related to the increased use of fertiliser by farmers it was reported in august  that villagers in chingola zambia

in  by indian nongovernment organisations led by the peoples union for civil liberties to the supreme court subcommittee regarding the potential environmental impact of the mines the ministry of environment and forests received reports from expert organisations and has submitted its recommendations to the supreme court the subcommittee has found blatant violations of environmental regulations and grave concerns about the impact of the niyamgiri mine on both the environment and the local tribal population the committee recommended to the court that mining in such an ecologically sensitive area should not be permitted human rightsedit in february  the church of england decided to disinvest from the company on ethical grounds according to the indigenous rights organisation survival international the church’s decision is extremely unusual as it almost always prefers a policy of constructive engagement’ to disinvesting the director of survival international stephen corry said the church’s unprecedented and very welcome decision sends a strong signal to companies that trample on tribal peoples’ rights we will not bankroll your abuses anybody that has shares in vedanta should sell them today if they care about human rights vedanta responded by expressing disappointment at the churchs actions and that it is fully committed to pursuing its investments in a responsible manner respecting the environment and human rights the ngo amnesty international has also criticised the companys record on human rights it has said it is clear that vedanta resources and its subsidiaries  have failed to respect the human rights of the people of lanjigarh and the niyamgiri hills adding the proposed bauxite mine  threatens the survival of a protected indigenous community  however these risks have been largely ignored and consultation with and disclosure of information to affected communities have been almost nonexistent following this controversy several shareholders have joined in selling their shares because of human rights concerns this includes the joseph rowntree charitable trust the marlborough ethical fund millfield house foundation and pggm the british and norwegian governments have both condemned the project and martin currie investments has also disinvested following pressure from survival the bp pension fund has reduced its shareholding over similar concerns

state of orissa ordered a new investigation into the rights of the dongria kondh tribe affected by vedanta resources bauxite mine in what survival international characterised as the third major blow to vedanta in a month the announcement came two weeks after the indian minister of environment and forests ordered an investigation on the same topic a government investigation published in march concluded that vedanta’s mine ‘may lead to the destruction of the dongria kondh’ a fourmember panel set up by government of india in the ministry of environment and forests investigated the bauxite mining proposal over niyamgiri near lanjigarh in the districts of kalahandi and rayagada in orissa the area has been traditional habitat of two particularly vulnerable tribal groups the dongria kondh and the kutia kondh the committee submitted its report on  august  saying the vedanta company has consistently violated the forest conservation act fca the forest rights act fra the environment protection act epa and the orissa forest act in active collusion with the state officials allowing mining  by depriving two primitive tribal groups of their rights over the proposed mining site to benefit a private company would shake the faith of the tribal people in the laws of the land  based on a panel report the government of india has served a show cause notice on the company on why its stage i environment clearance should not be cancelled legal violationsedit in july  sterlite industries a subsidiary of vedanta group was slapped a tax notice of about ₹ billion us million and charged
