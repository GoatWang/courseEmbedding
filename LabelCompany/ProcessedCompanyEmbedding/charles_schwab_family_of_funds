more about choosing an etf watch the video or read below for answers to the top five questions you should ask before investing in etfs transcript learn more about choosing an etf so youre thinking about investing in an exchangedtraded fund  youve decided on the asset class you want to invest in and you found a few etfs that could be right for your portfolio but how do you know which of those etfs is the right etf for you  start by asking yourself these five important questions about any etf youre considering  lets take them onebyone  first whats the expense ratio  when youre choosing an etf cost is an important factor  the expense ratio is the percentage of fund assets that are deducted every year to cover management fees  check to make sure that your etf has an expense ratio thats low compared to other funds in the same category  question   what will you pay in trade commission  trade commission is the second part of the cost equation  its the fee you pay every time you buy or sell an etf  look for a low commission or no commission at all if possible  question   whats the bidask spread  the bidask spread is another cost  this is the difference between the etfs bid price which is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a share and its ask price which is the price a seller is willing to accept for a share  often the more an etf is traded the smaller the bidask spread and the smaller the bidask spread the more of your money goes to the actual investment which is better for you  look for a spread of just a few pennies question   what are the funds total assets under management  youve considered the cost of your etf  now look at the quality  assets under management refers to the amount of money thats already been invested in the etf  its a pretty good indicator of the funds viability  schwabs experts prefer etfs that have at least  million in assets and preferably much more in general the more assets under management the better question   how do the etfs returns compare to its benchmarks returns  what you want to see is the etfs performance tracking closely to the performance of its benchmark over time  if there are significant differences between the two sets of returns it could mean that youre looking at a potentially riskier investment so those are our five questions  lets see how asking them can help you decide between two similar etfs from the same asset class  well take two hypothetical etfs and ask whats the expense ratio the trade commission the bidask spread what are the assets under management and how well do its returns track to the benchmark  while this is a simple example working through these five questions really can help you see which etf might be a better pick  ready to find the etf thats right for your portfolio  schwabs etf evaluation tools are a great place to start  youll find them at schwabcometftools  and if you need help as you choose the right etf for you just call us at  take the next stepopen an account at
