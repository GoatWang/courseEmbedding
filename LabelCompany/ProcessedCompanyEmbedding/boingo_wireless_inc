happened to me as to the other guys i signed up on the airport the connection was ok but  days later i get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which i didnt i tried to call the service number  no way try to access my online account  no way so i wrote an email to lauren which replied to some of the guys  lets see if she replies  ok update  email from lauren  automatic reply im out of the office   the final update i was contacted by the customer service and my contract was canceled to summarize i was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights so i registered for the boingo internet service one week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection  i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected  i try to call customer support number but i can not get through  i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page  i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud  at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra charges suggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections i made and i was charged for i would react much calmer i change my rating of boingo from  to  stars  dollars a month for whats supposed to be  mbps speed i have never seen more than  mbps to top it off it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more terrible most of the time useless thats precisely how i would describe boingo wireless service glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around update i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and only after i filed this complaint i contacted their company they tried to lie to me and keep it all did they silently and swiftly refund my  do not use this company i have filed a complaint with the bbb about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account i used this service once and i read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me theyve only agreed to refund half of this false charge i am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge never purchase anything from this company i paid  for a onetime charge for  hours of free wifi and i read all the terms and conditions before i let them charge me through paypal surprise they charged me an extra  yesterday several days after i used their service when i did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all i called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that  i wonder if it will even come through dont let them scam you out of your money dont let them trick you or lie to you and immediately deauthorize any payments to boingo wireless contact your bank and the bbb if they have tried to fraud you out of your money outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke boingo internet is absolute garbage they like to shut off and lose connection every other minute they like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you they tell you to basically deal with it i get better service at mcdonalds hotspot be careful i had signed up for boingo and decided to cancel instead of fully cancelling i changed to pay as you go my ipad or iphone had the boingo app and it auto connected at the airport did not use at all but found out after the fact that i had incurred  of charges over the course of  days because they charge you for each time it connects needless to say be careful if you cancel no refund offered boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my american express card its suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use boingo abroad for  month out of year they will send you a warning notice they will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the power to restrict your access if you complain asking for the review they suspend your service again with no specific reason they love you as customer when you dont use it but when you start to use it they will restrict your usage glad we didnt pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from amex is not really a benefit more like a scam this is not a real service dont sign up because you will end up being charged  in my case double charged for over a year i was able to get  refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited i was on and off the phone for half the morning i cant connect to boingo wireless at logan airport and i am a software engineer  minutes complimentary thats it i watched your ad and would be happy to watch another fing joke you all should  yourselves hope google or apple destroys your market im currently trying to use this service at ny jfk airpoirt its terrible i just paid for it but get constantly disconnected and when it does connect the speeds are quite slow  mbps updown when i got a test to run even loading the boingocom website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow naturally ill try to cancel the monthly service i just signed up for but based on the other reviews on here i worry that ill have some trouble as with many sketchy companies the question then becomes  why do other more reputable brands major airports and airlines drive business to them i wish i knew well here we go again competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks so i still have boingo and out of the last  days the internet has barely worked while im here which has been often their customer service is quite nice though their troubleshooting logic seems to come from premade lists since i was asked for the current speed test info when i said the internet was down the problem is problems persist theyre not unworkable  but theyre down or rediculously slow with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors i have other complaints about their services too but i wouldnt hold them lower than  star because theyre issues that i presume are the militarys fault maybe not theirs worst fucking service ever im paying  for the best plan they got and my xbox one is unplayable this is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it i can barely watch a video on my phone this is the worst internettvphone provider i have experienced this is my second time with boingo in two different locations with the  dollar monthly plan all i have to say is my one bar g on my iphone runs laps around this service boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now congratulations but never again was at the lax for  hours so figured id finally give paid service a try paid  for  hours of wireless  minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wifi option in other words  wasted boingo wireless claimed this

while im here which has been often their customer service is quite nice though their troubleshooting logic seems to come from premade lists since i was asked for the current speed test info when i said the internet was down the problem is problems persist theyre not unworkable  but theyre down or rediculously slow with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors

blvdfl los angeles ca    same happened to me as to the other guys i signed up on the airport the connection was ok but  days later i get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which i didnt i tried to call the service number  no way try to access my online account  no way so i wrote an email to lauren which replied to some of the guys  lets see if she replies  ok update  email from lauren  automatic reply im out of the office   the final update i was contacted by the customer service and my contract was canceled to summarize i was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights so i registered for the boingo internet service one week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection  i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected  i try to call customer support number but i can not get through  i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page  i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud  at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra charges suggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections i made and i was charged for i would react much calmer i change my rating of boingo from  to  stars  dollars a month for whats supposed to be  mbps speed i have never seen more than  mbps to top it off it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more terrible most of the time useless thats precisely how i would describe boingo wireless service glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around update i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and only after i filed this complaint i contacted their company they tried to lie to me and keep it all did they silently and swiftly refund my  do not use this company i have filed a complaint with the bbb about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account i used this service once and i read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me theyve only agreed to refund half of this false charge i am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge never purchase anything from this company i paid  for a onetime charge for  hours of free wifi and i read all the terms and conditions before i let them charge me through paypal surprise they charged me an extra  yesterday several days after i used their service when i did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all i called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that  i wonder if it will even come through dont let them scam you out of your money dont let them trick you or lie to you and immediately deauthorize any payments to boingo wireless contact your bank and the bbb if they have tried to fraud you out of your money outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke boingo internet is absolute garbage they like to shut off and lose connection every other minute they like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you they tell you to basically deal with it i get better service at mcdonalds hotspot be careful i had signed up for boingo and decided to cancel instead of fully cancelling i changed to pay as you go my ipad or iphone had the boingo app and it auto connected at the airport did not use at all but found out after the fact that i had incurred  of charges over the course of  days because they charge you for each time it connects needless to say be careful if you cancel no refund offered boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my american express card its suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use boingo abroad for  month out of year they will send you a warning notice they will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the power to restrict your access if you complain asking for the review they suspend your service again with no specific reason they love you as customer when you dont use it but when you start to use it they will restrict your usage glad we didnt pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from amex is not really a benefit more like a scam this is not a real service dont sign up because you will end up being charged  in my case double charged for over a year i was able to get  refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited i was on and off the phone for half the morning i cant connect to boingo wireless at logan airport and i am a software engineer  minutes complimentary thats it i watched your ad and would be happy to watch another fing joke you all should  yourselves hope google or apple destroys your market im currently trying to use this service at ny jfk airpoirt its terrible i just paid for it but get constantly disconnected and when it does connect the speeds are quite slow  mbps updown when i got a test to run even loading the boingocom website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow naturally ill try to cancel the monthly service i just signed up for but based on the other reviews on here i worry that ill have some trouble as with many sketchy companies the question then becomes  why do other more reputable brands major airports and airlines drive business to them i wish i knew well here we go again competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks so i still have boingo and out of the last  days the internet has barely worked while im here which has been often their customer service is quite nice though their troubleshooting logic seems to come from premade lists since i was asked for the current speed test info when i said the internet was down the problem is problems persist theyre not unworkable  but theyre down or rediculously slow with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors i have other complaints about their services too but i wouldnt hold them lower than  star because theyre issues that i presume are the militarys fault maybe not theirs worst fucking service ever im paying  for the best plan they got and my xbox one is unplayable this is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it i can barely watch a video on my phone this is the worst internettvphone provider i have experienced this is my second time with boingo in two different locations with the  dollar monthly plan all i have to say is my one bar g on my iphone runs laps around this service boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now congratulations but never again was at the lax for  hours so figured id finally give paid service a try paid  for  hours of wireless  minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wifi option in other words  wasted boingo wireless claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating details internet service providers edit

internet serviceone week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected i try to call customer support number but i can not get through i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra chargessuggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in

im out of the office   the final update i was contacted by the customer service and my contract was canceled to summarize i was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights so i registered for the boingo internet service one week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection  i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected  i try to call customer support number but i can not get through  i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page  i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud  at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra charges suggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections i made and i was charged for i would react much calmer i change my rating of boingo from  to  stars  dollars a month for whats supposed to be  mbps speed i have never seen more than  mbps to top it off it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more terrible most of the time useless thats precisely how i would describe boingo wireless service glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around update i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and only after i filed this complaint i contacted their company they tried to lie to me and keep it all did they silently and swiftly refund my  do not use this company i have filed a complaint with the bbb about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account i used this service once and i read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me theyve only agreed to refund half of this false charge i am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge never purchase anything from this company i paid  for a onetime charge for  hours of free wifi and i read all the terms and conditions before i let them charge me through paypal surprise they charged me an extra  yesterday several days after i used their service when i did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all i called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that  i wonder if it will even come through dont let them scam you out of your money dont let them trick you or lie to you and immediately deauthorize any payments to boingo wireless contact your bank and the bbb if they have tried to fraud you out of your money outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke boingo internet is absolute garbage they like to shut off and lose connection every other minute they like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you they tell you to basically deal with it i get better service at mcdonalds hotspot be careful i had signed up for boingo and decided to cancel instead of fully cancelling i changed to pay as you go my ipad or iphone had the boingo app and it auto connected at the airport did not use at all but found out after the fact that i had incurred  of charges over the course of  days because they charge you for each time it connects needless to say be careful if you cancel no refund offered boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my american express card its suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use boingo abroad for  month out of year they will send you a warning notice they will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the power to restrict your access if you complain asking for the review they suspend your service again with no specific reason they love you as customer when you dont use it but when you start to use it they will restrict your usage glad we didnt pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from amex is not really a benefit more like a scam this is not a real service dont sign up because you will end up being charged  in my case double charged for over a year i was able to get  refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited i was on and off the phone for half the morning i cant connect to boingo wireless at logan airport and i am a software engineer  minutes complimentary thats it i watched your ad and would be happy to watch another fing joke you all should  yourselves hope google or apple destroys your market im currently trying to use this service at ny jfk airpoirt its terrible i just paid for it but get constantly disconnected and when it does connect the speeds are quite slow  mbps updown when i got a test to run even loading the boingocom website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow naturally ill try to cancel the monthly service i just signed up for but based on the other reviews on here i worry that ill have some trouble as with many sketchy companies the question then becomes  why do other more reputable brands major airports and airlines drive business to them i wish i knew well here we go again competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks so i still have boingo and out of the last  days the internet has barely worked while im here which has been often their customer service is quite nice though their troubleshooting logic seems to come from premade lists since i was asked for the current speed test info when i said the internet was down the problem is problems persist theyre not unworkable  but theyre down or rediculously slow with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors i have other complaints about their services too but i wouldnt hold them lower than  star because theyre issues that i presume are the militarys fault maybe not theirs worst fucking service ever im paying  for the best plan they got and my xbox one is unplayable this is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it i can barely watch a video on my phone this is the worst internettvphone provider i have experienced this is my second time with boingo in two different locations with the  dollar monthly plan all i have to say is my one bar g on my iphone runs laps around this service boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now congratulations but never again was at the lax for  hours so figured id finally give paid service a try paid  for  hours of wireless  minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wifi option in other words  wasted boingo wireless claimed this

internet is absolute garbage they like to shut off and lose connection every other minute they like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you they tell you to basically deal with it i get better service at mcdonalds hotspot be careful i had signed up for boingo and decided to cancel instead of fully cancelling i changed to pay as you go my ipad or iphone had the boingo app and it auto connected at the airport did not use at all but found out after the fact that i had incurred  of charges over the course of  days because they charge you for each time it connects needless to say be careful if you cancel no refund offered  dollars a month for whats supposed to be  mbps speed i have never seen more than  mbps to top it off it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more terrible most of the time useless thats precisely how i would describe boingo wireless service the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my american express card its suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use boingo abroad for  month out of year they will send you a warning notice they will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the power to restrict your access if you complain asking for the review they suspend your service again with no specific reason they love you as customer when you dont use it but when you start to use it they will restrict your usage glad we didnt pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from amex is not really a benefit more like a scam well here we go again competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks so i still have boingo and out of the last  days the internet has barely worked while im here which has been often their customer service is quite nice though their troubleshooting logic seems to come from premade lists since i was asked for the current speed test info when i said the internet was down the problem is problems persist theyre not unworkable  but theyre down or rediculously slow with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors i have other complaints about their services too but i wouldnt hold them lower than  star because theyre issues that i presume are the militarys fault maybe not theirs outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam boingo hotspot has been under maintenance at the st louis airport since october tech support offers no excuses no apologies no estimated repair date i had to go to nd level tech support on a  minute call to get this much information the i dont care attitude is front and center dont waste time or energy on this connection solution i cant connect to boingo wireless at logan airport and i am a software engineer this is not a real service dont sign up because you will end up being charged  in my case double charged for over a year i was able to get  refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited i was on and off the phone for half the morning  minutes complimentary thats it i watched your ad and would be happy to watch another fing joke you all should  yourselves hope google or apple destroys your market this is the worst internettvphone provider i have experienced this is my second time with boingo in two different locations with the  dollar monthly plan all i have to say is my one bar g on my iphone runs laps around this service boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now congratulations but never again horrible wifi even worse website last customer service call i could barely hear the representative with all the laughing and joking from background employees unfortunate the military doesnt offer many wifi options in the barracks was at the lax for  hours so figured id finally give paid service a try paid  for  hours of wireless  minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wifi option in other words  wasted i use boingo on a military base in my dorm and it is a steaming hot pile of spaghetti code garbage my comouter is rsrely able to connect to the isp in the first place and when it does it only give me about a third of the speeds i pay for if you have any other options for isps go with the other option im forced to stay with them because its the only isp on base got swindled by their airport scam paid for an hour of service and found out i was billed monthly for almost a year only managed to get  months of it returned so i paid  for less than an hour of internet and i only used it because the free airport internet they provided wasnt working what a corrupt company they should be shut down boingo wireless claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating

the airport the connection was ok but  days later i get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which i didnt i tried to call the service number  no way try to access my online account  no way so i wrote an email to lauren which replied to some of the guys  lets see if she replies  ok update  email from lauren  automatic reply im out of the office   the final update i was contacted by the customer service and my contract was canceled to summarize i was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights so i registered for the boingo internet service one week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection  i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected  i try to call customer support number but i can not get through  i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page  i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud  at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra charges suggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections i made and i was charged for i would react much calmer i change my rating of boingo from  to  stars  dollars a month for whats supposed to be  mbps speed i have never seen more than  mbps to top it off it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more terrible most of the time useless thats precisely how i would describe boingo wireless service glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around update i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and only after i filed this complaint i contacted their company they tried to lie to me and keep it all did they silently and swiftly refund my  do not use this company i have filed a complaint with the bbb about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account i used this service once and i read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me theyve only agreed to refund half of this false charge i am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge never purchase anything from this company i paid  for a onetime charge for  hours of free wifi and i read all the terms and conditions before i let them charge me through paypal surprise they charged me an extra  yesterday several days after i used their service when i did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all i called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that  i wonder if it will even come through dont let them scam you out of your money dont let them trick you or lie to you and immediately deauthorize any payments to boingo wireless contact your bank and the bbb if they have tried to fraud you out of your money outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke be careful i had signed up for boingo and decided to cancel instead of fully cancelling i changed to pay as you go my ipad or iphone had the boingo app and it auto connected at the airport did not use at all but found out after the fact that i had incurred  of charges over the course of  days because they charge you for each time it connects needless to say be careful if you cancel no refund offered boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my american express card its suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use boingo abroad for  month out of year they will send you a warning notice they will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the power to restrict your access if you complain asking for the review they suspend your service again with no specific reason they love you as customer when you dont use it but when you start to use it they will restrict your usage glad we didnt pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from amex is not really a benefit more like a scam this is not a real service dont sign up because you will end up being charged  in my case double charged for over a year i was able to get  refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited i was on and off the phone for half the morning i cant connect to boingo wireless at logan airport and i am a software engineer  minutes complimentary thats it i watched your ad and would be happy to watch another fing joke you all should  yourselves hope google or apple destroys your market im currently trying to use this service at ny jfk airpoirt its terrible i just paid for it but get constantly disconnected and when it does connect the speeds are quite slow  mbps updown when i got a test to run even loading the boingocom website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow naturally ill try to cancel the monthly service i just signed up for but based on the other reviews on here i worry that ill have some trouble as with many sketchy companies the question then becomes  why do other more reputable brands major airports and airlines drive business to them i wish i knew well here we go again competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks so i still have boingo and out of the last  days the internet has barely worked while im here which has been often their customer service is quite nice though their troubleshooting logic seems to come from premade lists since i was asked for the current speed test info when i said the internet was down the problem is problems persist theyre not unworkable  but theyre down or rediculously slow with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors i have other complaints about their services too but i wouldnt hold them lower than  star because theyre issues that i presume are the militarys fault maybe not theirs worst fucking service ever im paying  for the best plan they got and my xbox one is unplayable this is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it i can barely watch a video on my phone this is the worst internettvphone provider i have experienced this is my second time with boingo in two different locations with the  dollar monthly plan all i have to say is my one bar g on my iphone runs laps around this service boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now congratulations but never again was at the lax for  hours so figured id finally give paid service a try paid  for  hours of wireless  minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wifi option in other words  wasted boingo wireless claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a

their service again which i didnt i tried to call the service number  no way try to access my online account  no way so i wrote an email to lauren which replied to some of the guys  lets see if she replies  ok update  email from lauren  automatic reply im out of the office   the final update i was contacted by the customer service and my contract was canceled to summarize i was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights so i registered for the boingo internet service one week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection  i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected  i try to call customer support number but i can not get through  i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page  i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud  at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra charges suggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections i made and i was charged for i would react much calmer i change my rating of boingo from  to  stars  dollars a month for whats supposed to be  mbps speed i have never seen more than  mbps to top it off it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more terrible most of the time useless thats precisely how i would describe boingo wireless service glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around update i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and only after i filed this complaint i contacted their company they tried to lie to me and keep it all did they silently and swiftly refund my  do not use this company i have filed a complaint with the bbb about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account i used this service once and i read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me theyve only agreed to refund half of this false charge i am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge never purchase anything from this company i paid  for a onetime charge for  hours of free wifi and i read all the terms and conditions before i let them charge me through paypal surprise they charged me an extra  yesterday several days after i used their service when i did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all i called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that  i wonder if it will even come through dont let them scam you out of your money dont let them trick you or lie to you and immediately deauthorize any payments to boingo wireless contact your bank and the bbb if they have tried to fraud you out of your money outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke boingo internet is absolute garbage they like to shut off and lose connection every other minute they like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you they tell you to basically deal with it i get better service at mcdonalds hotspot boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my american express card its suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use boingo abroad for  month out of year they will send you a warning notice they will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the power to restrict your access if you complain asking for the review they suspend your service again with no specific reason they love you as customer when you dont use it but when you start to use it they will restrict your usage glad we didnt pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from amex is not really a benefit more like a scam this is not a real service dont sign up because you will end up being charged  in my case double charged for over a year i was able to get  refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited i was on and off the phone for half the morning i cant connect to boingo wireless at logan airport and i am a software engineer  minutes complimentary thats it i watched your ad and would be happy to watch another fing joke you all should  yourselves hope google or apple destroys your market im currently trying to use this service at ny jfk airpoirt its terrible i just paid for it but get constantly disconnected and when it does connect the speeds are quite slow  mbps updown when i got a test to run even loading the boingocom website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow naturally ill try to cancel the monthly service i just signed up for but based on the other reviews on here i worry that ill have some trouble as with many sketchy companies the question then becomes  why do other more reputable brands major airports and airlines drive business to them i wish i knew well here we go again competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks so i still have boingo and out of the last  days the internet has barely worked while im here which has been often their customer service is quite nice though their troubleshooting logic seems to come from premade lists since i was asked for the current speed test info when i said the internet was down the problem is problems persist theyre not unworkable  but theyre down or rediculously slow with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors i have other complaints about their services too but i wouldnt hold them lower than  star because theyre issues that i presume are the militarys fault maybe not theirs worst fucking service ever im paying  for the best plan they got and my xbox one is unplayable this is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it i can barely watch a video on my phone this is the worst internettvphone provider i have experienced this is my second time with boingo in two different locations with the  dollar monthly plan all i have to say is my one bar g on my iphone runs laps around this service boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now congratulations but never again was at the lax for  hours so figured id finally give paid service a try paid  for  hours of wireless  minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wifi option in other words  wasted boingo wireless claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating details internet service providers edit

wilshire blvdfl los angeles ca    same happened to me as to the other guys i signed up on the airport the connection was ok but  days later i get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which i didnt i tried to call the service number  no way try to access my online account  no way so i wrote an email to lauren which replied to some of the guys  lets see if she replies  ok update  email from lauren  automatic reply im out of the office   the final update i was contacted by the customer service and my contract was canceled to summarize i was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights so i registered for the boingo internet service one week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection  i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected  i try to call customer support number but i can not get through  i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page  i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud  at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra charges suggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections i made and i was charged for i would react much calmer i change my rating of boingo from  to  stars glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around update i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and only after i filed this complaint i contacted their company they tried to lie to me and keep it all did they silently and swiftly refund my  do not use this company i have filed a complaint with the bbb about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account i used this service once and i read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me theyve only agreed to refund half of this false charge i am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge never purchase anything from this company i paid  for a onetime charge for  hours of free wifi and i read all the terms and conditions before i let them charge me through paypal surprise they charged me an extra  yesterday several days after i used their service when i did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all i called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that  i wonder if it will even come through dont let them scam you out of your money dont let them trick you or lie to you and immediately deauthorize any payments to boingo wireless contact your bank and the bbb if they have tried to fraud you out of your money outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke boingo internet is absolute garbage they like to shut off and lose connection every other minute they like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you they tell you to basically deal with it i get better service at mcdonalds hotspot be careful i had signed up for boingo and decided to cancel instead of fully cancelling i changed to pay as you go my ipad or iphone had the boingo app and it auto connected at the airport did not use at all but found out after the fact that i had incurred  of charges over the course of  days because they charge you for each time it connects needless to say be careful if you cancel no refund offered boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my american express card its suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use boingo abroad for  month out of year they will send you a warning notice they will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the power to restrict your access if you complain asking for the review they suspend your service again with no specific reason they love you as customer when you dont use it but when you start to use it they will restrict your usage glad we didnt pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from amex is not really a benefit more like a scam this is not a real service dont sign up because you will end up being charged  in my case double charged for over a year i was able to get  refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited i was on and off the phone for half the morning i cant connect to boingo wireless at logan airport and i am a software engineer  minutes complimentary thats it i watched your ad and would be happy to watch another fing joke you all should  yourselves hope google or apple destroys your market im currently trying to use this service at ny jfk airpoirt its terrible i just paid for it but get constantly disconnected and when it does connect the speeds are quite slow  mbps updown when i got a test to run even loading the boingocom website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow naturally ill try to cancel the monthly service i just signed up for but based on the other reviews on here i worry that ill have some trouble as with many sketchy companies the question then becomes  why do other more reputable brands major airports and airlines drive business to them i wish i knew well here we go again competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks so i still have boingo and out of the last  days the internet has barely worked while im here which has been often their customer service is quite nice though their troubleshooting logic seems to come from premade lists since i was asked for the current speed test info when i said the internet was down the problem is problems persist theyre not unworkable  but theyre down or rediculously slow with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors i have other complaints about their services too but i wouldnt hold them lower than  star because theyre issues that i presume are the militarys fault maybe not theirs worst fucking service ever im paying  for the best plan they got and my xbox one is unplayable this is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it i can barely watch a video on my phone this is the worst internettvphone provider i have experienced this is my second time with boingo in two different locations with the  dollar monthly plan all i have to say is my one bar g on my iphone runs laps around this service boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now congratulations but never again was at the lax for  hours so figured id finally give paid service a try paid  for  hours of wireless  minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wifi option in other words  wasted boingo wireless claimed this

options in the barracks i signed up for internet as i moved in after my divorce  and as of this writing i still have it while im waiting for other providers to setup service to my room their service despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from comcast or century link is the worst service ive ever paid for their connectivity is fleeting their speeds varied and slow their customer service slow illogical and unhelpful and are always insisting their systems show no problems  despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently asking for

happened to me as to the other guys i signed up on the airport the connection was ok but  days later i get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which i didnt i tried to call the service number  no way try to access my online account  no way so i wrote an email to lauren which replied to some of the guys  lets see if she replies  ok update  email from lauren  automatic reply im out of the office   the final update i was contacted by the customer service and my contract was canceled to summarize i was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights so i registered for the boingo internet service one week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection  i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected  i try to call customer support number but i can not get through  i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page  i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud  at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra charges suggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections i made and i was charged for i would react much calmer i change my rating of boingo from  to  stars  dollars a month for whats supposed to be  mbps speed i have never seen more than  mbps to top it off it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more terrible most of the time useless thats precisely how i would describe boingo wireless service glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around update i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and only after i filed this complaint i contacted their company they tried to lie to me and keep it all did they silently and swiftly refund my  do not use this company i have filed a complaint with the bbb about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account i used this service once and i read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me theyve only agreed to refund half of this false charge i am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge never purchase anything from this company i paid  for a onetime charge for  hours of free wifi and i read all the terms and conditions before i let them charge me through paypal surprise they charged me an extra  yesterday several days after i used their service when i did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all i called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that  i wonder if it will even come through dont let them scam you out of your money dont let them trick you or lie to you and immediately deauthorize any payments to boingo wireless contact your bank and the bbb if they have tried to fraud you out of your money outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke boingo internet is absolute garbage they like to shut off and lose connection every other minute they like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you they tell you to basically deal with it i get better service at mcdonalds hotspot be careful i had signed up for boingo and decided to cancel instead of fully cancelling i changed to pay as you go my ipad or iphone had the boingo app and it auto connected at the airport did not use at all but found out after the fact that i had incurred  of charges over the course of  days because they charge you for each time it connects needless to say be careful if you cancel no refund offered boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my american express card its suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use boingo abroad for  month out of year they will send you a warning notice they will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the power to restrict your access if you complain asking for the review they suspend your service again with no specific reason they love you as customer when you dont use it but when you start to use it they will restrict your usage glad we didnt pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from amex is not really a benefit more like a scam this is not a real service dont sign up because you will end up being charged  in my case double charged for over a year i was able to get  refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited i was on and off the phone for half the morning i cant connect to boingo wireless at logan airport and i am a software engineer  minutes complimentary thats it i watched your ad and would be happy to watch another fing joke you all should  yourselves hope google or apple destroys your

happened to me as to the other guys i signed up on the airport the connection was ok but  days later i get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which i didnt i tried to call the service number  no way try to access my online account  no way so i wrote an email to lauren which replied to some of the guys  lets see if she replies  ok update  email from lauren  automatic reply im out of the office   the final update i was contacted by the customer service and my contract was canceled to summarize i was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights so i registered for the boingo internet service one week later i receive an email from boingo with receipt for one day internet service what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time at this point i think that whenever a boingo wlan is picked up by my computer my account will be automatically charged for the connection  i try to log in to my boingo account to turn off this option but i fail there is no username data in the registration conformation mail and the username i try to use is rejected  i try to call customer support number but i can not get through  i google for other people experiences with boingo and end up on this page  i see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud  at the end the customer support was fast and fair  my account was canceled without any extra charges suggestion to boingo when a user register for the service the confirmation mail should contain hishers username also check the login page to the boingo account if i was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections i made and i was charged for i would react much calmer i change my rating of boingo from  to  stars  dollars a month for whats supposed to be  mbps speed i have never seen more than  mbps to top it off it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more terrible most of the time useless thats precisely how i would describe boingo wireless service glad i checked yelp before signing up with boingo so many bad reviews and this company is still around update i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and only after i filed this complaint i contacted their company they tried to lie to me and keep it all did they silently and swiftly refund my  do not use this company i have filed a complaint with the bbb about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account i used this service once and i read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me theyve only agreed to refund half of this false charge i am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge never purchase anything from this company i paid  for a onetime charge for  hours of free wifi and i read all the terms and conditions before i let them charge me through paypal surprise they charged me an extra  yesterday several days after i used their service when i did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all i called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that  i wonder if it will even come through dont let them scam you out of your money dont let them trick you or lie to you and immediately deauthorize any payments to boingo wireless contact your bank and the bbb if they have tried to fraud you out of your money outage almost every other week i live in the army barracks where the only internet we can get is boingo wifi which costs me  a month i chose the most expensive plan thinking i could worry less about the internet now turns out im wrong just this week alone we had a basewide outage on tuesday and today is saturday the day i usually play online games and watch youtube all day guess what another outage it has been  hours since i reported it but they still have not fixed it   thank you boingo for ruining my saturday i dont know how much they paid the army to be the only authorized wifi provider for army bases but please army change it to another company please i am already tired enough training for the whole week i do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn wifi do not use do not use do not use being charged for services i do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam this company is the worst wireless service provider i have ever experienced not only is it awful wifi in general they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account once its taken out they refuse to refund it this company and their customer service is a joke boingo internet is absolute garbage they like to shut off and lose connection every other minute they like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you they tell you to basically deal with it i get better service at mcdonalds hotspot be careful i had signed up for boingo and decided to cancel instead of fully cancelling i changed to pay as you go my ipad or iphone had the boingo app and it auto connected at the airport did not use at all but found out after the fact that i had incurred  of charges over the course of  days because they charge you for each time it connects needless to say be careful if you cancel no refund offered boingo is worthless first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks i needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen i was unable to because of the service outage when the rep on the phone asks me to connect to base wifi and i say its not there i told you that already his answer shouldnt be well connect to boingo wifi and go to cnn because if i could do that i would have lastly if i pay for a service it had better be down for seconds not over a day dont be stupid and use boingo pay the money for a real isp my words of advice  boingo train your reps  step up your techs  hours without service makes me want to punch something  if you have other choices use them  if you dont have other services buy a hot spot trust me it is still better  if you like self inflicted pain call the service reps  dont get boingo ive had boingo for almost  years now and ive never had a problem until my recent move ive made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called  days prior and said the connection was fixed the problem was still there when i got home since then ive made multiple calls and i keep getting the same response from the support team we will put in a request to have them call you still no calls if you cant service an area then dont charge them for service they are notcant get the service is horrendous i got it as benefit from my
