its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below     · level  quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date         · level  pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date         · level  pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when

hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the

pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed management does not believe based

on form k   narrative description of the business    focus universal inc “the company” “we” “us” or “our” currently conducts business as a handheld sensor systems and filters wholesaler to distribution platforms we are working on developing a universal sensor node and gateway system that use the data processing capabilities of a smartphone to display readings of multiple probe modules we are also researching the development of an anticounterfeit authentication technology that we believe could address the problem of counterfeit production by attempting to authenticate consumer goods   through a merger with perfecular inc we strategically expanded our business to the manufacture and marketing of hightech electronic devices we realized that internet marketing would not be sufficient to generate sales of our products particularly the ubiquitor product we are going to focus on all types of marketing particularly marketing directly to established consumer distributions retailers for this reason in  we decided to emphasize our sales of handheld sensors and air filters and discontinue our marketing and advertising business segment through the development and creation of our ubiquitor device we anticipate that sales and marketing involved with bringing this product to market will require us to hire a number of new employees in order to gain traction in the market as well as continue to expand such sales of our existing sensor and air filter products   our current services include   scientific instrument research and development and sales   engineers and scientists use instrumentation to observe understand and manage realworld data and phenomena events and processes related to their industries or areas of expertise instrumentation systems that we are researching and developing measure and control electrical signals such as voltage current and power as well as temperature pressure speed flow volume torque light sensing and vibration for example common generalpurpose instruments in our market segment include for example voltmeters signal generators oscilloscopes data loggers spectrum analyzers cameras and temperature and pressure monitors and controllers systems that perform measurement and control can be generally categorized as test measurement and embedded systems   a new approach to measurement and sensing   we offer a different approach than what is currently on the market because we are attempting to establish a demand for devices that link handheld devices and sensors with common smartphone computing power through an application on the smartphone in both ios and android devices tapping into the computing power of a smartphone enables a measurement device to increase its capabilities   we also offer an array of traditional handheld measurement and control meters through our wholesale distribution platform                  filter and handheld meter wholesaler   we are a wholesaler of various filtration products and digital meters we source our products from manufacturers in china and then sell to a major us distributor who resells our products directly to consumers through retail distribution channels   specifically we sell the following products   fan speed adjuster device  we provide a fan speed adjuster device to retailers and distributors designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors our adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without causing the motor to hum these devices are rated for  watts max have vac voltage capacity and feature an internal electronic autoresetting circuit breaker    carbon filter devices  we also sell two types of carbon filter devices to distributors these carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed and used to filter air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics one of these filters can be attached to a centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single pass filter which moves air out of the growing area and filters unwanted odors and removes pollens dust and other debris in the air the other filter is designed to be used with fans from  cfm   hepa filtration device  we provide an organic air high efficiency particulate arrestance “hepa” filtration device at wholesale prices to distributors and retailers manufactured tested certified and labeled in accordance with current hepa filter standards this device is targeted towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects bacteria and mold out of grow rooms we sell these devices in various sizes   digital light meter  we provide a handheld digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units or footcandles the meter we sell is designed to be full cosine corrected for the angular incidence of light meaning if you are not holding the sensor perpendicular to the light source the sensor will still read the light correctly the meter has a builtin low battery indicator and is designed to accurately measure to  fc   quantum par meter  we provide a handheld quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation “par” this fully portable handheld par meter is designed to measure par flux in wavelengths ranging from  to  nm it is designed to measure up to  umol   ubiquitor wireless universal sensor device   we have fully researched and developed a device we call the “ubiquitor” which is a handheld fully modular system with a universal sensor node and gateway system that uses a smartphone as the output display module that displays the readings of various probe modules we have completed an initial production run of  devices and intend to develop this into fullscale production as soon as possible the ubiquitor is a wireless sensor device that combines measuring tools with smartphone technology to quickly deliver sensor node data on desktop and mobile phone screens the ubiquitor’s sensor analytics system will integrate eventmonitoring storage and analytics software in a cohesive package that we hope will provide a holistic view of sensor data it is reading   after sending our circuit boards to china for soldering at an unaffiliated manufacturing facility we assembled the initial production run at our facilities here in the city of industry this initial production run will allow us to show large distributors and consumers the capabilities of the ubiquitor which we hope will generate demand   the physical hardware consists of      the sensor probes which come in hundreds of different varieties of sensor instruments in the form of a usb stick with both male and female ports and      the main hardware gateway a small cell phone size device with integrated circuits   this device is intended to connect up to  kilometers of sensor instruments and integrate data using embedded software to display the data and all analytics onto a digital screen desktop or mobile displays using multiple types of wireless connections ie wifi bluetooth g and g most types of probes can connect to the hardware if the sensor size is bigger than the standard probe size it is possible to simply use a usb cable to connect the probe and the hub all data and analytics are displayed on a single screen with tools that record and keep track of all measurements and sort and display analytic information in easy to read charts                   the ubiquitor is a general platform that collects data in real time up to hz per second and thus is intended to be adapted to many industry uses   the ubiquitor is a multipurpose wireless intelligent sensor device that will be intended to achieve universal compatibility currently the ubiquitor device could simultaneously accommodate more than  different types of sensor heads users could use their smartphones to simultaneously operate and monitor over  kinds of sensor readings with perfecular’s technology users only need to obtain the sensor heads facilitating ease and convenience of use using a smartphone users can collect and analyze data in real time we have not yet started research and development of a second generation ubiquitor device but once we demonstrate the market for this product intend to begin such research and development   intellectual property protection   after the merger on january   we filed provisional patent application number  with attorney docket number perpau and confirmation no  prior to its expiration on november   we filed a full utility patent application with the us patent and trademark office number  we anticipate that the publication will be required to occur on or around july   we filed the trademark “ubiquitor” on july   under serial no     competitors   there are several competitors we have identified in the wireless sensor node industry including traditional instruments or devices manufacturers such as hanna instruments or extech instruments   hach developed and launched sc multiparameter universal controller a probe module for connecting up to  sc sensors and their products are not compatible with smart phones yet and we believe their pricepoint is still prohibitive to consumers   monnit corporation offers a range of wireless or remote sensors many of monnit’s products are webbased wireless sensors usually are not portable because of the power consumption also the sensors realtime updates are slow and we believe security of the webbased sensor data acquisition also may be a concern in addition to purchasing the device consumers usually have to pay monthly fee for using webbased services   we are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or device manufacturers because we utilize our ubiquitor universal smart device in conjunction with our generic instruments smartphone application which we believe will be a completely different product category   market potential   we believe that wireless universal smart technology will play a critical role for traditional instrument manufacturers as it is too expensive and difficult to develop for medium or smaller companies the cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies and implement them in their products or use them in their field testing we also hope to play a role in academic laboratories particularly with smaller academic laboratories who are sensitive to price   recent developments   recently the china association for science and technology “cast” and the people’s government of jilin province china formed a joint task force to hold an entrepreneurship competition called the “innovation and entrepreneurship competition for overseas talents” the competition will be conducted from march  through june  and will aim to attract outstanding talent and help establish new businesses with advanced technologies in changchun the capital of jilin province the first prize winners will receive financial support from the changchun government pe firms and venture capitals and will be recommended to participate in the  national innovation and entrepreneurship week   we submitted an application on april   and together with an endorsement from the overseas chinese entrepreneur alliance “ocea” we were accepted to be one of the  projects to participate in the stage two selection at the massachusetts institute of technology on may     there are three different stages of the competition stage one is the preliminary contest where companies are sponsored by ocea and the local chinese communities there are  projects in our specific category that will to participate in the second stage of the competition   the second stage is the selection stage the results from this stage will be concluded before may th and  total projects from among  total projects across all subcategories will be selected to enter the final round of the competition the final round of the competition is when the selection committee will invite the  projectsteams to the final contest which will be held in changchun and will arrange showcases and meetings with the sponsoring financial institutions and government officials   results of operations for the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march     revenue cost of sales and gross profit   our consolidated gross revenue for the three months ended march   and  was  and  respectively our cost of consolidated cost of revenues for the three months ended march   and  was  and  respectively resulting in a gross profit of  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively   prior to the merger with perfecular management was focused on pursuing growth strategies and opportunities and outsourced the performance of internet marketing services to third parties rather than performing the internet marketing services directly this change in strategy cost more money and generated less immediate revenue postmerger we have been able to distribute a full range of products held as inventory by a related party tianjin guanglee directly to a range of businesses who have established distribution channels directly with consumers                operating costs and expenses   the major components of our operating expenses for the three months ended march   and  are outlined in the table below       for the three months ended march       for the three months ended march       increase decrease    officer compensation                –   general and administrative                     professional fees                     research and development                      total operating expenses                     general and administrative expenses of  incurred during the three months ended march   primarily consisted of office rent of  march     office salaries of  march       professional fees decreased from  during the three months ended march   to  during the three months ended march   a decrease of    officer compensation of  march     and research and development of  march     during three months ended march   were expenses attributable to perfecular   net losses   during the three months ended march   and  we incurred net losses of  and  respectively due to the factors discussed above   liquidity and capital resources   working capital       march       december     current assets             current liabilities             working capital              cash flows   the table below for the periods indicated provides selected cash flow information       for the three months ended march       for the three months ended march     net cash used in operating activities           net cash used in investing activities     –         net cash used in financing activities     –         net change in cash and cash equivalents             due to the merger with perfecular inc we anticipate that for the next  months we will be generating cash from more diversified revenue streams as mentioned herein   we believe that our cash generated from operations and cash on hand may not provide sufficient capital to fund our operations and meet our cash needs on a short term and longterm basis for the next twelve months  consequently we intend to finance our internal growth with cash on hand cash provided from operations borrowings debt or equity offerings or some combination thereof to expand our business so that we can meet our cash needs                  cash flows from operating activities   the net cash outflows from operating activities of  for the three months ended march   was primarily the result of our net loss of  and changes in our operating assets and liabilities the net cash outflows from operating activities of  for the three months ended march   was primarily the result of our net loss of  and changes in our operating assets and liabilities   we expect that cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results utilization of new revenue streams collection of accounts receivable and timing of billings and payments   cash flows from investing activities   the net cash used in investing activities of  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively represents funds used to purchase property and equipment for the company   cash flows from financing activities   we repaid  and  related to advances from a related party and a shareholder respectively during the three months ended march   and  respectively   management expects to keep operating costs to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities management plans to continue to seek in addition to equity financing other sources of financing eg bank loan line of credit shareholder loan on favorable terms however there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms if at all   if we are unable to generate profits sufficient to cover our operating costs or unable to obtain additional funds for our working capital needs we may need to cease or curtail operations  furthermore there is no assurance the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover cash requirements during the initial stages of the company’s operations   off balance sheet arrangements   as of march   we did not have any offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item aii of regulation sk                  item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the exchange act and are not required to provide the information required under this item     item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls   under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the securities and exchange act of  at the end of the period covered by this report based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the material information required to be included in our securities and exchange commission reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms relating to our company particularly during the period when this report was being prepared   our management concluded we did not maintain effective controls over the company’s financial reporting the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting caused principally by inadequate staffing and technical expertise in key positions resulted in overly relying on outside consultants to make numerous adjustments to our financial statements additionally the significant deficiencies or material weaknesses could result in future material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected management has concluded that the identified control deficiencies constitutes a material weakness   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected or were reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls   disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well designed and implemented can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving an entitys disclosure objectives the likelihood of achieving such objectives is affected by limitations inherent in disclosure controls and procedures these include the fact that human judgment in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human failures such as simple errors or mistakes or intentional circumvention of the established process                      part

statement is filed with the securities and exchange commission and transmitted to the shareholders of the company each of dr jennifer gu and dr edward lee would become members of the board of directors and the entire board of directors would consist of dr desheng wang dr jennifer gu and dr edward lee   in  we leased a warehouse in los angeles county california we have relocated our headquarters to the los angeles area to expand our existing operations and grow the company we subleased part of the warehouse space to perfecular inc a related company that was majorityowned by desheng wang one of our directors officers and control shareholders in  we acquired perfecular   scientific instrument research development and sales   industry background and overview   through our acquisition of perfecular inc we entered into the scientific instrument industry specifically the instrument sensor industry instrument sensors are devices specifically designed and constructed for sensing and measuring physical variables that are useful in i industrial operations ii environmental commercial and medical applications iii research and development in a variety of industries and iv the daily lives of electronics consumers   we believe that instrument sensors are important in modern science having applications in both the industrial and educational fields in recent years significant progress has been made in instruments and instrumentation systems the performance of measuring and monitoring instruments has improved considerably in the computer age analog instruments are used to indicate the magnitude of the quantity in the form of pointer movement digital instruments on the other hand specify the quantity in a digital format they can be read easily and are more accurate than the analog multimeters reducing interpolation and reading errors digital instruments offer significant advantages over analog devices the autopolarity function of digital devices prevents various problems parallax error which occurs when the pointer of an analog instrument is viewed from a different angle which may cause users to see and read a different value are eliminated as well digital instruments are free from wear and potential shock failures because they have no moving parts with the advancements in technology of integrated circuits digital instruments are becoming increasingly compact and accurate key market players of analog and digital instruments include thermo fisher scientific danaher corporation mettler toledo metrohm usa hanna instruments agilent technologies and perkin elmer                most modern instruments are digital they are designed for measuring various physical quantities in objects and consist of the following functional components   · data acquisition this is the process of sampling signals that measure real world physical conditions and converting the resulting samples into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a microprocessor the components of data acquisition systems include a   sensors to convert physical parameters to electrical signals b signal conditioning circuitry to convert sensor signals into a form that can be converted to digital values c analogtodigital converters to convert conditioned sensor signals to digital values it normally operates on conditioned signals that is signals that have already been filtered and amplified by analog circuits · storage and communication components applicationspecific inputoutput io components in digital instrumentation systems the transmission of data between devices is realized relatively easily by using serial or parallel transmission techniques · ancillaries such as displays and power supplies and application specific software   traditional hardwarecentered instrumentation systems are made up of multiple standalone instruments that are interconnected to carry out a determined measurement or control an operation they have fixed vendordefined functionality are very powerful and large expensive and cumbersome they also require a lot of power and often have excessive amounts of features that are not user friendly users generally cannot extend or customize them easily the knobs and buttons on the instrument the builtin circuitry and the functions available to the user are specific to the nature of the instrument   instrument interoperability and connectivity allow the ubiquitor to communicate and work with other instruments manufactured by different vendors in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those instruments traditional instruments including traditional hardwarecentered instrumentations and software centered virtual instrumentations are specifically designed constructed and refined to perform one or more specific tasks most of the instruments on the market come with a variety of connectivity technologies and do not have the builtin firmware or software to support the connectivity and interoperability of instruments without drastically revising the application software across instrument brands unfortunately while the instrument drivers simplify software development and maintenance they did not address hardware obsolescence since each manufacturer has their own drivers and application and none are compatible current applications are limited only to large expensive test and measurement instruments    a universal instrument is a versatile device which combines many individual instrument functions sensors and probes in a single unit it has a primary purpose but also incorporates other instrument’s functionalities one instrument could perform many different measurements and control and substitute many other instruments it utilizes a variety of probes to connect to the device for a wide variety of process measurement and control a universal instrument offers superior sensor or probe compatibility versatility interoperability connectivity and scalability theoretically it is feasible to design a universal instrument which is compatible with all sensors or probes on the market and capable of monitoring and controlling any combination of sensors or probes   despite the undoubted usefulness of the universal instruments one of the major obstacles that prevent the universal instruments from being adopted by end users is their cost the cost of a  traditional instrument which incorporates the functions of a  instrument may have to increase its cost to the order of  the end user who just needs a  traditional instrument for his applications certainly does not have the motivation to spend  for functions he does not need functionality always needs to be balanced against cost the knobs and buttons on the instrument the builtin circuitry and the functions available to the user are specific to the nature of the instrument making them very expensive and hard to adapt                smartphones and tablets have been considered recreational devices for communicating playing games and streaming videos but they are also one of the most powerful tools engineers use for designing validating and producing products these ubiquitous smartphones perform better than most instrumentation in many fields because of their network connectivity smartphones and tablets are great tools for remotely viewing measurements however their small size and processing power also makes them effective for portable measurements the ubiquity of wireless connectivity combined with increasing functionality and the speed of connected devices and mobile networks will further drive consumer demand for more cost effective smartphone based instruments building an application for a smartphone or tablet and turning a smartphone or tablet to an instrument is not a trivial task many of the instrument manufacturers have limited or no expertise programming for mobile platforms and designing wireless hardware to help instrument manufacturers take advantage of these smart devices perfecular inc has dedicated many years of research and development efforts into designing manufacturing marketing and promoting wireless smart technology and products   universal smart protocol focuses not only on the design of the hardware and software modules but also on the design of the overall universal smart instruments system guided by the structured universal and modular principles it is open to instrument manufacturers software and hardware developers   compatibility the compatibility in universal smart instrument system refers not only to the compatibility between the same types of instruments from different manufactures but also to the compatibility between various instrument types the full interoperability and absolute instrument interchangeability was addressed in the protocol   universality all functionalities of the traditional instruments are integrated into a single unit allowing different data acquisition modules to execute on the same mobile platform thus the interoperability between various sensors or probes can be achieved   upgradeability the most traditional instrument interface is a unidirectional application the instrument performs its task and transmits results to the interface device in one direction only many traditional instruments have been limited by design to unidirectional interfaces they only perform monitoring tasks and share a majority of functions of the bidirectional controlling instruments however they cannot be upgraded to controllers end users have to purchase a new controlling instrument for their applications taking advantage of the secure bidirectional wireless communications and interface supported by smartphones or mobile devices universal smart instruments which deliver data between the smartphone and sensors back and forth can be readily modified or upgraded by adding the corresponding actuators for controlling applications sensors or probes measure the output performance of the device being controlled and give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections towards the desired performance   expandability and scalability similar to sensor network technology universal smart instruments are more flexible than sensor networks they can currently monitor and control a few hundreds of sensors or probes they automatically identify and configure the corresponding graphical user interfaces end users are free to add or removes sensors or probes all communication protocols supported by smartphones are integrated in the software design including wifi blue tooth cellular network technology and wired form through the audio port on the smartphone   security universal smart instruments have the sensor security builtin data acquisition module and help companies meet sensor security requirements preventing unauthorized users from accessing the sensor measurements and control unauthorized access of the universal smart instruments sensors is forbidden   our approach to measurement and sensing   we offer a different approach that links handheld devices and sensors with common smartphone computing power through an application on the smartphone in both ios and android devices tapping into the computing power of a smartphone enables a measurement device to increase its capabilities   we also offer an array of traditional handheld meters through our wholesale distribution platform                filter and handheld meter wholesaler   we are a wholesaler of various filtration products and digital meters we source our products from manufacturers in china and then sell to a major us distributor who resells our products directly to consumers through retail distribution channels specifically we sell the following products   fan speed adjuster device  we provide a fan speed adjuster device to retailers and distributors designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors our adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without causing the motor to hum these devices are rated for  watts max have vac voltage capacity and feature an internal electronic autoresetting circuit breaker   carbon filter devices we also sell two types of carbon filter devices to distributors these carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed and used to filter air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics one of these filters can be attached to a centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single pass filter which moves air out of the growing area and filters unwanted odors and removes pollens dust and other debris in the air the other filter is designed to be used with fans from  cfm   hepa filtration device we provide an organic air high efficiency particulate arrestance “hepa” filtration device at wholesale prices to distributors and retailers manufactured tested certified and labeled in accordance with current hepa filter standards this device is targeted towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects bacteria and mold out of grow rooms we sell these devices in various sizes   digital light meter we provide a handheld digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units or footcandles the meter we sell is designed to be full cosine corrected for the angular incidence of light meaning if you are not holding the sensor perpendicular to the light source the sensor will still read the light correctly the meter has a builtin low battery indicator and is designed to accurately measure to  fc   quantum par meter we provide a handheld quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation “par” this fully portable handheld par meter is designed to measure par flux in wavelengths ranging from  to  nm it is designed to measure up to  umol   ubiquitor wireless universal sensor device   our “ubiquitor” device will be a handheld fully modular system with a universal sensor node and gateway system that will use a smartphone as the output display module that displays the readings of various probe modules we have initial functioning prototype devices created and intend to develop this into fullscale production the ubiquitor will be a wireless sensor device that combines measuring tools with smartphone technology to quickly deliver sensor node data on desktop and mobile phone screens the ubiquitor’s sensor analytics system will integrate eventmonitoring storage and analytics software in a cohesive package that provides a holistic view of sensor data it is reading   the physical hardware consists of      the sensor probes which come in hundreds of different varieties of sensor instruments in the form of a usb stick with both male and female ports and    the main hardware gateway a small cell phone size device with integrated circuits   this device can connect up to  kilometers of sensor instruments and integrate data using embedded software to display the data and all analytics onto a digital screen desktop or mobile displays using a wifi connection most types of probes can connect to the hardware if the sensor size is bigger than the standard probe size it is possible to simply use a usb cable to connect the probe and the hub all data and analytics are displayed on a single screen with tools that record and keep track of all measurements and sort and display analytic information in easy to read charts                the ubiquitor is a general platform that collects data in real time up to hz per second and thus is intended to be adapted to many industry uses   the ubiquitor is a multipurpose wireless intelligent sensor device its greatest advantage is universal compatibility currently the ubiquitor device could simultaneously accommodate more than  different types of sensor heads therefore users could use their smartphones to simultaneously operate and monitor over  kinds of sensor readings with perfecular’s technology users only need to obtain the sensor heads facilitating ease and convenience of use using a smartphone users can collect and analyze data in real time   by using the smartphone as a substitute platform we believe we will achieve the following efficiencies      cut production costs smartphone technology will advance and become more widely used than the vast majority products on the small sensor device market by utilizing smartphone technology the ubiquitor will add superior functionality and performance improve the product’s quality and cutting production costs    reduce the effort required to develop a new sensor product with the ubiquitor we believe that there will be no need for device manufacturers to research and develop the new monitoring and operating components because they will just need to develop new sensor heads based on our software technology    reduce clutter it is anticipated that the ubiquitor dispenses with the hassle of hooking up cables since it is based on wireless transmission of data   strategy   strategy and marketing plan   we have designed manufactured marketed and distributed our electronic measurement devices such as temperature humidity meters digital meters quantum par meters ph meters tds meters and co monitors for many years and have many loyal customers the universal smart technology has been applied to our existing traditional devices and demonstrated functionality and hardware cost savings we believe we have achieved hardware cost savings in the range of  to  prototypes were sent to our customers for demonstrations and evaluation currently we are in the stage of producing a pilot manufacturing run the first round of pilot production was completed in may  the second round of pilot production was completed in july    smartphones are an integral part of our wireless universal smart technology system both wireless and wired communication connectivity are used and targeted on different applications in wired connectivity the data acquisition module is connected through the audio port in the smartphone the smartphone is used to replace a traditional instrument compared with the wireless solution the wireless communication module or even the power supply used for data acquisition module are eliminated in the design as a consequence of this some hardware costs are saved end users are not able to access the sensors or probes remotely we believe that the instruments based on wired universal smart technology are not as convenient as their wireless counterparts currently in the industry however wired instruments are cheaper   we believe that being the first ones in the market provides a significant and sustained marketshare advantage over later competitors we first focus on our existing instruments and convert them to universal smart devices and market them to our existing customers   we are putting together an internal sales team with the proceeds of the offering in order to get established for the marketing efforts   we believe that wireless universal smart technology will play a critical role for traditional instrument manufacturers as it is too expensive and difficult to develop for medium or smaller companies the cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies and implement them in their products there are hundreds of thousands of instrument manufacturers and trilliondollar revenues for this industry in china we plan to open a sales department in china dedicate to promoting our technologies to local instrument manufacturers                smartphones have been seamlessly integrated into our daily life a large number of functions and services have become accessible to the masses through the use of smart phones the proliferation of the smartphone and its userfriendly interface which allows access to digital information will cause these devices to become a crucial part of our wireless universal smart instruments   our goals over the next three years include     · raise capital to move to full manufacturing and production for our ubiquitor device   · partner with manufacturers and promote the adoption of our ubiquitor platform   · acquire a stable market share of the handheld wireless sensor device market   · continue to develop market share in our wholesale distribution of sensors and filters and   · utilize our internet marketing strategies to market our handheld sensors and filters   in order to achieve these goals we intend to focus on the following initiatives     · position the ubiquitor product as the industry standard in universal wireless sensor reading technology   · establish strategic supply chain channels to facilitate efficient production operations and   · communicate the product and service differentiation through direct networking and effective marketing   distribution method   we intend to continue to engage in relationships with chinese manufacturers and then distribute our products to distributors and retailers directly from the chinese manufacturers and then we intend to distribute the ubiquitor by selling directly to traditional instrument manufacturers we believe that traditional instrument manufacturers will adopt this technology since the ubiquitor device is intended to consolidate various other sensors   we intend to manufacture and market the ubiquitor and sell it directly to consumers or distributors using internet marketing and also using channels such as amazoncom and to launch the product through crowdfunding sites like indiegogo and kickstartercom we also intend to establish a marketing department overseas in china   raw materials   the electronic components used in the ubiquitor are common and can be easily purchased production and assembly lines are also available worldwide   manufacturing and production   we have a limited production facility in california where small and medium sized circuit board production can take place until we have enough sales to convert manufacturing to a largescale manufacturing facility in china where we have key strategic relationships with manufacturing facilities                competitors   there are several competitors we have identified in the wireless sensor node industry including traditional instruments or devices manufacturers such as hanna instruments or extech instruments   hach developed and launched sc multiparameter universal controller a probe module for connecting up to  sc sensors and their products are not compatible with smart phones yet and we believe their pricepoint is still prohibitive to consumers   monnit corporation offers a range of wireless or remote sensors many of monnit’s products are webbased wireless sensors usually are not portable because of the power consumption also the sensors realtime updates are slow and we believe security of the webbased sensor data acquisition also may be a concern in addition to purchasing the device consumers usually have to pay monthly fee for using webbased services   we are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or device manufacturers because we utilize our ubiquitor universal smart device in conjunction with our generic instruments smartphone application which we believe will be a completely different product category   patent trademark license and franchise restrictions and contractual obligations and concessions   on november   we filed a us patent application number  with the us patent and trademark office we hope this full patent application protects the ubiquitor universal sensor device it is anticipated that the publication will occur on july   we do not own either legally or beneficially any trademarks   research and development activities   other than time spent researching our proposed business we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date we do not currently plan to spend any funds on research and development activities in the future   compliance with environmental laws   we are not aware of any environmental laws that have been enacted nor are we aware of any such laws being contemplated for the future that impact issues specific to our business   employees   as of the date of this annual report we have seven fulltime and two parttime employees the company’s officers our president dr edward lee our chief executive officer and secretary desheng wang our officers and directors are responsible for planning developing and operational duties and will continue to do so throughout the early stages of our growth our seven fulltime employees are working in the warehouse orchestrating the development and distribution of our handheld sensor devices as well as our filters   reports to securities holders   we provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders we will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the securities exchange act of  we are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing form k annually and form q quarterly in addition we will file form k and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required we do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the exchange act the public may read and copy any materials that we file with the securities and exchange commission sec at the secs public reference room at  f street ne washington dc    the public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at sec the sec maintains an internet site httpwwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec              item a risk factors    we lack an operating history there is no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues if we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably our business will fail   we were incorporated on december   and as of december   have realized  in revenues incurred  in cost of revenue and  in operating costs since inception december   as of december   we had deficit accumulated during the development stage of  we have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made based upon current plans we expect to continue generating revenues however our revenues may not be sufficient to cover our operating costs we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues in the future failure to achieve a sustainable sales level will cause us to go out of business   we require significant funding to manufacture and market our ubiquitor wireless sensor   we may ultimately require up to  million to fund the manufacturing and marketing strategy for our product once we achieve this fund raising goal we intend to position ourselves in the small device market establishing the price at below a few hundred dollars due to superior functionality and low price we expect to capture this section of the market fairly easily while our product and service matures and the company becomes better known we will seize the highend market none of this will be possible if we fail to obtain the funding we require   we depend on key personnel   our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel particularly desheng wang our chief executive officer and our president edward lee   if any of our directors and officers will choose to leave the company we will face significant difficulties in attracting potential candidates for replacement of our key personnel due to our limited financial resources and operating history in addition the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could delay our plan of operations and harm our ability to provide services to our current customers and harm the market’s perception of us   we outsourced our product manufacturing and procurement decreasing quality and reliability and protectability   we have fully outsourced all manufacturing and have no direct control over the manufacturing processes of our products this lack of control may increase quality or reliability risks and could limit our ability to quickly increase or decrease production rates it also creates liability in that we could lose control of our intellectual property that is not properly protected   demand for our products is uncertain and depends on our currently unproven ability to create and maintain superior performance   our future operating results will depend upon our ability to provide our products or services and to operate profitably in an industry characterized by intense competition rapid technological advances and low margins this in turn will depend on a number of factors including     · our ability to generate significant sales and profit margin from the ubiquitor device   · worldwide market conditions and demand for web services sensor devices and other products we may continue to add as we move forward   · our success in meeting targeted availability dates for our products and services   · our ability to develop and commercialize new intellectual property and to protect existing intellectual property   · our ability to maintain profitable relationships with our distributors retailers and other resellers   · our ability to maintain an appropriate cost structure   · our ability to attract and retain competent motivated employees   · our ability to comply with applicable legal requirements throughout the world and   · our ability to successfully manage litigation including enforcing our rights protecting our interests and defending claims made against us                these factors are difficult to manage satisfy and influence and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sustain profits in the future   our ubiquitor product could fail to gain traction in the marketplace for a number of reasons that would adversely impact our financial results and cause our investors to lose money   future successful sales of our ubiquitor entail numerous risks such as     · any lack of market acceptance of the ubiquitor   · failure to maintain acceptable arrangements with product suppliers particularly in light of lower than anticipated volumes   · manufacturing technical supplier or qualityrelated delays issues or concerns including the loss of any key supplier or failure of any key supplier to deliver high quality products on time   · competition   · potential declines in demand for sensor devices and   · risks that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against our products   in order to compete successfully we must accurately forecast demand closely monitor inventory levels secure quality products continuously drive down costs meet aggressive product price and performance targets create market demand for our brand and hold sufficient but not excess inventory   there is a risk that the market will not adapt to using the smartphone as a substitute platform for sensor devices causing our products to fail in the marketplace   there is a risk that the market will not receive the smartphone technology which we will be using as our platform the vast majority of products on the small sensor device market do not currently use smartphones to collect and analyze sensor data there is no guarantee that using smartphone technology will cut production costs and be well received if our platform using smartphone technology is not well received there is a risk that device manufacturers will develop new monitoring and operating components that are incompatible with our current platform instead of developing the traditional sensors that are compatible with our technology updating our platform to stay compatible with new components could increase our costs unexpectedly   using wireless transmission technologies such as wifi and bluetooth may create security risks   there is also a risk of failure based on the wireless transmission of data used by our smartphone platform if there is instability in a wireless network bluetooth sensor or other network problems that are out of our control our new platform may not be well received our smartphone platform relies on the wireless transmission of data through wifi networks and bluetooth sensors these networks are often deemed less secure than a hardwired network the security of a wireless network is often out of our control however any breach of security could result in the market and sensor device manufacturers to fail to embrace our platform   our business involves the use transmission and storage of confidential information and the failure to properly safeguard such information could result in significant reputational harm   we may at times collect store and transmit information of or on behalf of our clients that may include certain types of confidential information that may be considered personal or sensitive and that are subject to laws that apply to data breaches we believe that we take reasonable steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts to protect this information including through a cyberattack that circumvents existing security measures and compromises the data that we store if such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed most states have enacted data breach notification laws and in addition to federal laws that apply to certain types of information such as financial information federal legislation has been proposed that would establish broader federal obligations with respect to data breaches we may also be subject to claims of breach of contract for such unauthorized disclosure or access investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed the unauthorized disclosure of information or a cybersecurity incident involving data that we store may result in the termination of one or more of our commercial relationships or a reduction in client confidence and usage of our services we may also be subject to litigation alleging the improper use transmission or storage of confidential information which could damage our reputation among our current and potential clients and cause us to lose business and revenue                our business depends on our ability to keep manufacturing costs low and we may lack the expertise necessary to negotiate and maintain favorable pricing supply business and credit terms with our potential vendors   it may be difficult to negotiate or maintain favorable pricing supply business or credit terms with our potential vendors suppliers and service providers in addition product manufacturing costs may increase if we fail to achieve anticipated volumes there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage these risks in summary we can offer no assurance that we will be able to obtain a sufficient but not excess supply of products on a timely and cost effective basis our failure to do so would lead to a material adverse impact on our business   the lack of public company experience of our management team could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of us securities laws   dr wang lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by sarbanesoxley act of  our ceo and cfo have never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended which is necessary to maintain our public company status if we were to fail to fulfill those obligations our ability to continue as a us public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company   our officers directors consultants and advisors are involved in other businesses and not obligated to commit their time and attention exclusively to our business and therefore they may encounter conflicts of interest with respect to the allocation of time and business opportunities between our operations and those of other businesses   our president mr desheng wang is currently involved in other businesses and not obligated to commit his time and attention exclusively to our business and accordingly he may encounter conflicts of interest in allocating his own time or any business opportunities that he may encounter between our operations and those of other businesses furthermore if the execution of our business plan demands more time than is currently committed by him he will be under no obligation to commit such additional time and his failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business and successfully execute our business plan   another example of a conflict of interest is so called “selfdealing transactions the director of perfecular is dealing with himself and may not reach an agreement that is fair to the company eg his remuneration for serving as officer of the company if a conflictofinterest transaction is negotiated and approved in a manner that approximates armslength negotiations the transaction is accepted unless a shareholder proves in court that the transaction is not entirely fair to the company the burden is on the shareholder to show lack of entire fairness otherwise the transaction is considered invalid if challenged unless the director proves in court that the transaction is entirely fair to the company the burden is on the director to show entire fairness   if as a result of before mentioned conflicts we are deprived of business opportunities or information the execution of our business plan and our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace may be adversely affected if we become aware of such conflict of interests we will take an immediate action to resolve it each conflict of interest will be handled by the company based on the nature of the conflict and the individual involved in it   we do not have any actual or potential conflict of interests with our consultants or advisors   we do not have a majority of independent directors on our board and the company has not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures in the absence of which stockholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters   federal legislation including the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges such as the nyse or the nasdaq stock market on which their securities are listed among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors’ independence audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics we have not yet adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange we are not required to do so our board of directors is comprised of one individual as a result we do not have independent directors on our board of directors                we have not adopted corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committee of our board of directors as we presently do not have independent directors on our board if we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors we may seek to establish an audit and other committee of our board of directors it is possible that if our board of directors included independent directors and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurance that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct for example at present in the absence of audit nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages or employment contracts to our officers are made by a director who has an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided   however as a general rule the board of directors in making its decisions determines first that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us that those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties the company executes the transaction between executive officers once approved by the board of directors   prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions   we have concluded that we have not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting through the year ended december   significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal control could have material adverse effects on us   it is important for us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting which is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   for a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness see “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” included in item a of this report a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information we plan to implement a number of remediation steps to address the material weakness as described in item a of this report if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures we could be subject to among other things regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects   we currently have identified significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that if not corrected could result in material misstatements of our financial statements   in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended march   we identified significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and a general understanding of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” as such there is a reasonable possibility that a misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   as we have thus far not needed to comply with section  of the sarbanesoxley act neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act in light of the deficiency we believe that it is possible that certain control deficiencies may have been identified if such an evaluation had been performed                we are working to remediate the deficiencies or material weaknesses we have taken steps to enhance our internal control environment and plan to take additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses specifically     · we have hired additional outside consultants and will fire unqualified personnel in our accounting department especially to add an experienced accountant in a controller capacity we will continue to evaluate the structure of the finance organization and add resources as needed     · we are implementing additional internal reporting procedures including those designed to add depth to our review processes and improve our segregation of duties     · we are updating our systems so that we may collect the necessary information to enable us to more effectively monitor and comply with applicable filing requirements on a timely basis and     · we are in the process of documenting assessing and testing our internal control over financial reporting as part of our efforts to comply with section  of the sarbanesoxley act   although we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible we are unable at this time to estimate how long it will take and our efforts may not be successful in remediating the deficiencies or material weaknesses   we do not have a majority of independent directors on our board and the company has not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures in the absence of which stockholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters   federal legislation including the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges such as the nyse or the nasdaq stock market on which their securities are listed among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors’ independence audit committee oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics we have not yet adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange we are not required to do so our board of directors is comprised of three individuals all of whom are also our executive officers as a result we do not have independent directors on our board of directors   we have not adopted corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committee of our board of directors as we presently do not have independent directors on our board if we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors we may seek to establish an audit and other committee of our board of directors it is possible that if our board of directors included independent directors and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurance that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct for example at present in the absence of audit nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages or employment contracts to our senior officers are made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided   however as a general rule the board of directors in making its decisions determines first that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us that those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties   prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions                because one of our directors who is also our sole promoter owns over  of our outstanding common stock he could make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to other minority shareholders   one of our directors owns over  of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the date of this reporting accordingly directors have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets they also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of our directors may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders   our executive officers and directors collectively have the power to control our management and operations and have a significant majority in voting power on all matters submitted to the stockholders of the company   management currently beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding common stock consequently management has the ability to influence control of the operations of the company and acting together will have the ability to influence or control substantially all matters submitted to stockholders for approval including     · election of our board of directors   · removal of directors   · amendment to the company’s articles of incorporation or bylaws and   · adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger takeover or other business combination   these stockholders have complete control over our affairs accordingly this concentration of ownership by itself may have the effect of impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business consolidation or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the common stock   you could be diluted from our future issuance of capital stock and derivative securities   as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock to the extent of such authorization our board of directors will have the ability without seeking stockholder approval to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock in the future for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient the issuance of additional common stock or preferred stock in the future may reduce your proportionate ownership and voting power   none of the members of our board of directors are considered audit committee financial experts if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results as a result current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock   members of our board of directors are inexperienced with us gaap and the related internal control procedures required of us public companies management has determined that our internal audit function is also significantly deficient due to insufficient qualified resources to perform internal audit functions finally we have not established an audit committee of our board of directors   we are a smaller reporting company with limited resources therefore we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis for these reasons we are considering the costs and benefits associated with improving and documenting our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures which includes i hiring additional personnel with sufficient us gaap experience and ii implementing ongoing training in us gaap requirements for our cfo and accounting and other finance personnel if the result of these efforts are not successful or if material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting andor our disclosure controls and procedures and we could be required to further implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation                the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management   we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements including those required by the securities and exchange commission complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements is timeconsuming and may result in increased costs to us and could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act and requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of  as amended or sox these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sox requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources   these activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations   in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed   we also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee and qualified executive officers   the company is subject to the d reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of  which does not require a company to file all the same reports and information as fully reporting company   pursuant to section d we are required to file periodic reports with the sec such as annual reports on form k quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k once our registration statement is declared effective including the annual report on form k for the fiscal year during which the registration statement is declared effective that filing obligation will generally apply even if our reporting obligations have been suspended automatically under section d of the exchange act prior to the due date for the form k    after that fiscal year and provided the company has less than  shareholders the company is not required to file these reports if the reports are not filed the investors will have reduced visibility as to the company and its financial condition in addition as a filer subject to section d of the exchange act the company is not required to prepare proxy or information statements our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the going private regulations the company will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules our officers directors and more than ten  percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our company that these persons will not be subject to the shortswing profit recovery provisions of the exchange act and that more than five percent  holders of classes of your equity securities will not be required to report information about their ownership positions in the securities                we will not be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act until the end of the second fiscal year reported upon in our second annual report on form k   the sarbanesoxley act of  and the new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commissions the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and the public company accounting oversight board have imposed various new requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices   we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly these costs could affect profitability and our results of operations   we are in the process of determining whether our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are compliant with section  we will not be required to conduct the evaluation of effectiveness of our internal controls until the end of the fiscal year reported upon in our second annual report on form k in addition because we are a smaller reporting company we are not required to obtain the auditor attestation of management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting if we obtain and disclose such reports we could continue doing so at our discretion so long as we remain a smaller reporting company   this process of internal control evaluation and attestation may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time effort and expense to complete if it is determined that we are not in compliance with section  we may be required to implement new internal control procedures and reevaluate our financial reporting if we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently it could harm our operations financial reporting or financial results which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our periodic reporting obligations under the exchange act   there is a very limited public trading market for our common stock and therefore our investors may not be able to sell their shares   our common stock is listed on the overthecounter exchange and is thinly traded as a result stockholders may be unable to liquidate their investments or may encounter considerable delay in selling shares of our common stock if an active trading market does develop the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile due to among other things the nature of our business and because we are a new public company with a limited operating history further a few individual stockholders dominate our shares the limited trading volume subjects the price of our common stock to manipulation by one or more stockholders and will significantly limit the number of shares that one can purchase or sell in a short period of time the market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors most of which are beyond our control     · variations in our quarterly and annual operating results   · changes in general economic conditions   · changes in technologies favored by consumers   · price competition or pricing changes by us or our competitors and   · the addition or loss of key managerial and collaborative personnel   the equity markets have on occasion experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies securities and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies any such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance as a result stockholders may be unable to sell their shares or may be forced to sell them at a loss   our common stock has not been widely traded and the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially   to date there has been a limited public market for shares of our common stock with limited trading an active public trading market may not develop or if developed may not be sustained the current market price of our common stock and any possible subsequent listing on another larger securities exchange if and when we are successful in doing so will be affected by a number of factors including those discussed above                future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline   if our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market then the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly the perception in the public market that our stockholders might sell shares of common stock also could depress the market price of our common stock there are approximately  shares of our common stock outstanding of which approximately  shares are currently freely tradable we may in the future issue and register additional shares of our common stock that might be freely transferable at the time of such transaction   a decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities   we do not intend to pay dividends and there will be less ways in which you can make a gain on any investment in focus universal inc   we have never paid any cash dividends and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future to the extent that we require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan our funding sources may likely prohibit the payment of a dividend because we do not intend to declare dividends any gain on an investment in focus universal inc will need to come through appreciation of the stock’s price   you may face significant restrictions on the resale of your shares due to state “blue sky” laws   each state has its own securities laws often called “blue sky” laws which  limit sales of securities to a state’s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration and  govern the reporting requirements for brokerdealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state before a security is sold in a state there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction or it must be exempt from registration the applicable brokerdealer must also be registered in that state   we do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state a determination regarding registration will be made by those brokerdealers if any who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock there may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell and on purchasers to buy our securities you should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification   focus universal is an “emerging growth company” under the jumpstart our business startups act we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors   focus universal is and will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of a the last day of the fiscal year during which its total annual revenues equal or exceed  billion subject to adjustment for inflation b the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering c the date on which focus universal has during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt securities or d the date on which focus universal is deemed a large accelerated filer with at least  million in public float under the securities and exchange act of  the exchange act”   for so long as focus universal remains an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies as described in further detail in the risk factors below focus universal cannot predict if investors will find its shares of common stock less attractive because focus universal will rely on some or all of these exemptions if some investors find focus universals shares of common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for its shares of common stock and its stock price may be more volatile   if focus universal avails itself of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements its reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate focus universal and may result in less investor confidence                the recently enacted jobs act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on emerging growth companies focus universal meets the definition of an emerging growth company and so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company it will not be required to     · have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act   · comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis   · submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and   · disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceo’s compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies however focus universal is choosing to opt out of such extended transition period and as a result focus universal will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for nonemerging growth companies section  of the jobs act provides that its decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable   notwithstanding the above we are also currently a “smaller reporting company” meaning that we are not an investment company an assetbacked issuer or a majorityowned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than  million and annual revenues of less than  million during the most recently completed fiscal year   in the event that we are still considered a “smaller reporting company” at such time are we cease being an “emerging growth company” we will be required to provide additional disclosure in our sec filings however similar to “emerging growth companies” “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings are exempt from the provisions of section b of the sarbanesoxley act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are not required to conduct sayonpay and frequency votes until annual meetings occurring on or after january   and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their sec filings including among other things only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports decreased disclosures in our sec filings due to our status as an “emerging growth company” or “smaller reporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze the company’s results of operations and financial prospects   item b unresolved staff comments   none     item  properties   we entered into a twoyear lease agreement in a multitenant warehouse facility in los angeles county whereby we pay  per month starting on april   to april   on may   the monthly lease payment increased to  per month     item  legal proceedings   we are not currently a party to any

as a handheld sensor systems and filters wholesaler to distribution platforms we are working on developing a universal sensor node and gateway system that use the data processing capabilities of a smartphone to display readings of multiple probe modules we are also researching the development of an anticounterfeit authentication technology that we believe could address the problem of counterfeit production by attempting to authenticate consumer goods   through a merger with perfecular inc we strategically expanded our business to the manufacture and marketing of hightech electronic devices we realized that internet marketing would not be sufficient to generate sales of our products particularly the ubiquitor product we are going to focus on all types of marketing particularly marketing directly to established consumer distributions retailers  for this reason during the first quarter of  we decided to emphasize our sales of handheld sensors and air filters and discontinue our marketing and advertising business segment through the development and creation of our ubiquitor device we anticipate that sales and marketing involved with bringing this product to market will require us to hire a number of new employees in order to gain traction in the market as well as continue to expand such sales of our existing sensor and air filter products   our current services include     scientific instrument research and development and sales     engineers and scientists use instrumentation to observe understand and manage realworld data and phenomena events and processes related to their industries or areas of expertise instrumentation systems that we are researching and developing measure and control electrical signals such as voltage current and power as well as temperature pressure speed flow volume torque light sensing and vibration for example common generalpurpose instruments in our market segment include for example voltmeters signal generators oscilloscopes data loggers spectrum analyzers cameras and temperature and pressure monitors and controllers systems that perform measurement and control can be generally categorized as test measurement and embedded systems                 a new approach to measurement and sensing   we offer a different approach than what is currently on the market because we are attempting to establish a demand for devices that link handheld devices and sensors with common smartphone computing power through an application on the smartphone in both ios and android devices tapping into the computing power of a smartphone enables a measurement device to increase its capabilities   we also offer an array of traditional handheld measurement and control meters through our wholesale distribution platform   filter and handheld meter wholesaler   we are a wholesaler of various filtration products and digital meters we source our products from manufacturers in china and then sell to a major us distributor who resells our products directly to consumers through retail distribution channels specifically we sell the following products   fan speed adjuster device  we provide a fan speed adjuster device to retailers and distributors designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors our adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without causing the motor to hum these devices are rated for  watts max have vac voltage capacity and feature an internal electronic autoresetting circuit breaker   carbon filter devices  we also sell two types of carbon filter devices to distributors these carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed and used to filter air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics one of these filters can be attached to a centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single pass filter which moves air out of the growing area and filters unwanted odors and removes pollens dust and other debris in the air the other filter is designed to be used with fans from  cfm   hepa filtration device  we provide an organic air high efficiency particulate arrestance “hepa” filtration device at wholesale prices to distributors and retailers manufactured tested certified and labeled in accordance with current hepa filter standards this device is targeted towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects bacteria and mold out of grow rooms we sell these devices in various sizes   digital light meter  we provide a handheld digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units or footcandles the meter we sell is designed to be full cosine corrected for the angular incidence of light meaning if you are not holding the sensor perpendicular to the light source the sensor will still read the light correctly the meter has a builtin low battery indicator and is designed to accurately measure to  fc   quantum par meter  we provide a handheld quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation “par” this fully portable handheld par meter is designed to measure par flux in wavelengths ranging from  to  nm it is designed to measure up to  umol   ubiquitor wireless universal sensor device   we have fully researched and developed a device we call the “ubiquitor” which is a handheld fully modular system with a universal sensor node and gateway system that uses a smartphone as the output display module that displays the readings of various probe modules we have completed an initial production run of  devices and intend to develop this into fullscale production as soon as possible the ubiquitor is a wireless sensor device that combines measuring tools with smartphone technology to quickly deliver sensor node data on desktop and mobile phone screens the ubiquitor’s sensor analytics system will integrate eventmonitoring storage and analytics software in a cohesive package that we hope will provide a holistic view of sensor data it is reading   after sending our circuit boards to china for soldering at an unaffiliated manufacturing facility we assembled the initial production run at our facilities here in the city of industry this initial production run will allow us to show large distributors and consumers the capabilities of the ubiquitor which we hope will generate demand              the physical hardware consists of      the sensor probes which come in hundreds of different varieties of sensor instruments in the form of a usb stick with both male and female ports and      the main hardware gateway a small cell phone size device with integrated circuits   this device is intended to connect up to  kilometers of sensor instruments and integrate data using embedded software to display the data and all analytics onto a digital screen desktop or mobile displays using multiple types of wireless connections ie wifi bluetooth g and g most types of probes can connect to the hardware if the sensor size is bigger than the standard probe size it is possible to simply use a usb cable to connect the probe and the hub all data and analytics are displayed on a single screen with tools that record and keep track of all measurements and sort and display analytic information in easy to read charts   the ubiquitor is a general platform that collects data in real time up to hz per second and thus is intended to be adapted to many industry uses   the ubiquitor is a multipurpose wireless intelligent sensor device that will be intended to achieve universal compatibility currently the ubiquitor device could simultaneously accommodate more than  different types of sensor heads users could use their smartphones to simultaneously operate and monitor over  kinds of sensor readings with perfecular’s technology users only need to obtain the sensor heads facilitating ease and convenience of use using a smartphone users can collect and analyze data in real time we have not yet started research and development of a second generation ubiquitor device but once we demonstrate the market for this product intend to begin such research and development   intellectual property protection   on november   we filed a us patent application number  with the us patent and trademark office we hope this full patent application protects the ubiquitor universal sensor device it is anticipated that the publication will occur on july   we do not own either legally or beneficially any trademarks   competitors   there are several competitors we have identified in the wireless sensor node industry including traditional instruments or devices manufacturers such as hanna instruments or extech instruments   hach developed and launched sc multiparameter universal controller a probe module for connecting up to  sc sensors and their products are not compatible with smart phones yet and we believe their pricepoint is still prohibitive to consumers   monnit corporation offers a range of wireless or remote sensors many of monnit’s products are webbased wireless sensors usually are not portable because of the power consumption also the sensors realtime updates are slow and we believe security of the webbased sensor data acquisition also may be a concern in addition to purchasing the device consumers usually have to pay monthly fee for using webbased services   we are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or device manufacturers because we utilize our ubiquitor universal smart device in conjunction with our generic instruments smartphone application which we believe will be a completely different product category   market potential   we believe that wireless universal smart technology will play a critical role for traditional instrument manufacturers as it is too expensive and difficult to develop for medium or smaller companies the cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies and implement them in their products or use them in their field testing we also hope to play a role in academic laboratories particularly with smaller academic laboratories who are sensitive to price                results of operations   for the twelve months ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december   unaudited   revenue cost of sales and gross profit   our consolidated gross revenue for the twelve months ended december   and  was  and  respectively our cost of revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  was  and  respectively resulting in a gross profit of  and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively    for the twelve months ended december   we only generated revenue from search engine optimizating consulting internet campaign planning and social media consulting for twelve months ended december   besides our digital marketing business we also generated significant amount of revenue from sales of broad selection of garden equipment which was the primary business for perfecular and is now our primary business   we hired an independent third party contractor who performed web development beginning in the first quarter of  this service was terminated on april   as we discontinued offering digital marketing services     the increase in revenue is primarily driven by the sales from perfecular of  for twelve months ended december   since the acquisition of perfecular on december   our revenues have increased and we believe that such revenues could continue to increase as we continue to market and sell our products   prior to the merger with perfecular management was focused on pursuing growth strategies and opportunities and outsourced the performance of internet marketing services to third parties rather than performing the internet marketing services directly this change in strategy cost more money and generated less immediate revenue postmerger we have been able to distribute a full range of products held as inventory by a related party tianjin guanglee directly to a range of businesses who have established distribution channels directly with consumers   operating expenses   the major components of our operating expenses for the twelve months ended december   and  are outlined in the table below

used in financing activities                     net increase decrease in cash                       due to the merger with perfecular inc we anticipate that for the next twelve months we will be generating cash from more diversified revenue stream as mentioned under item  company background we believe that our cash generated from operations and cash on hand will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations and meet our cash needs on a short term and longterm basis for the next twelve months we intend to finance our internal growth with cash on hand cash provided from operations borrowings debt or equity offerings or some combination thereof to expand our business so that we can meet our cash needs   cash flows from operating activities   our cash flows from operating activities represent the most significant source of funding for our operations the primary use of our operating cash include funding general operating expenses marketing travel legal and professional expenses and office rent and cost of revenues our cash provided by operating activities generally follows the trend in our net revenues and operating results   our net cash generated by operating activities of  for the twelve months ended december   was primarily the result of our net loss of  largely offset for cash flow purposes by changes in our operating assets and liabilities these changes include an increase in accounts receivable of  prepaid expense of  accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  and depreciation expense of  and a reduction in inventories of  customer deposits of  and deferred rent of  the increase in accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and accrued expense and customer deposit was due to the merger with perfecular inc on december   the increase of prepaid expenses was due to the payment of  annual fees to otc markets group inc that covers a period from september   to august   as of december   the company expensed a portion of these fees in the amount of  the increase in deposits was due to security deposits paid for sublease agreement with a tenant                the net cash used in operating activities of  for the twelve months ended december   was primarily the result of our net loss of  and changes in our operating assets and liabilities these changes include an increase in customer deposit of  and accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  a reduction in accounts receivable to a related party of  inventories of  and deposits of    we expect that cash provided by used in operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results utilization of new revenue streams collection of accounts receivable and timing of billings and payments   cash flows from investing activities   the net cash used in investing activities of  and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively represents funds used to

acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of perfecular’s common stock in  to one exchange ratio total proceeds received from this transaction amounted to     management expects to keep operating costs to a minimum until cash is available through financing or operating activities management plans to continue to seek in addition to equity financing other sources of financing eg bank loan line of credit shareholder loan on favorable terms however there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms if at all if we are unable to generate profits sufficient to cover our operating costs or unable to obtain additional funds for our working capital needs we may need to cease or curtail operations furthermore there is no assurance the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover cash requirements during the initial stages of the company’s operations   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance

is new rapidly evolving and intensely competitive competition is expected to intensify in the future as more companies enter the space we compete for business on a number of factors including return on marketing investment price access to targeted audiences and quality competition in the online advertising and marketing industry is also highly fragmented any company that provides one or more of our core services is in direct competition with us our competition includes advertising firms public relations companies web design companies graphic design companies and search engine optimization firms our competitors range in size from small local independent firms and individuals to very large conglomerates such fragmentation can mean that a small business owner can employ more than one advertising and marketing agency to get a needed mix of web design and online marketing services for their desired budget the online media marketing industry is always evolving with thousands of new competitors entering the market every year it is becoming very difficult for companies to distinguish themselves in the market and gain new customers in addition to competition from other firms the number of potential customers is decreasing as businesses begin to design their own websites and execute inline advertising themselves there are a large number of companies that provide website templates that are easy to alter once purchased without the need to hire a web design and development company while basic coding knowledge is needed to effectively customize a template and incorporate social management and monitoring solutions to fit an individual business’s needs many new businesses are choosing to use an existing template versus paying for a new website design company description
