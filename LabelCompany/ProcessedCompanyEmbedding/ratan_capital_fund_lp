weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

novus methodology how we calculate alpha september   by melina sanchez share tweet share  share hedge funds manager analysis manager monday ratan capital stan altshuller chief research officer this weeks manager monday looks into the public filings of the only femalerun tiger cub ratan capital learn how theyve outperformed exactly one year ago bloombergbusiness profiled a young hedge fund manager who seeded by julian robertson currently runs the new yorkbased ratan capital management the article claimed that while being a “brilliant stock picker” nehal chopra’s tough managerial style presented challenges with retaining talent while we are not going to opine on the softer issues of people management we can respectfully test the first assumption about her investment management acumen a recent study by kyria capital a firm that invests in womenrun hedge funds found some distinctions between male and female asset managers given she is the only female manager in our group of about  tiger cubs anne dias griffin who used to run robertsonbacked aragon returned money to clients in  we will also test how different or unique her portfolio is relative to her fellow male tiger cubs and seeds as usual for our manager mondays everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data including the manager’s profile simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary the data used here omits the short side nonequity securities many nonus securities and all nonpublic information such as actual fund performance to simulate performance and determine portfolio attributes such as liquidity we combine public holdings data with market and pricing data and make simple assumptions since being seeded by roberston in  ratan’s assets have grown significantly especially in the last few years some of the growth was due to performance but that’s only part of the story her impressive track record has attracted new capital and robertson himself increased his allocation our data starts at her first filing with the sec – december of  there are aum thresholds managers must cross to make filing a requirement we use our standard “novus lens” to peek under the hood of this manager let’s dive in     ratan capital aum and concentration changes as mentioned ratan’s aum we use total reported assets as a proxy has grown considerably since their first filing and now hover around  billion in light of this increase in assets the manager cut position count effectively focusing her book on a smaller number of stocks and driving up her concentration she runs a more concentrated book than most other tiger seeds as her top ten securities represent close to  of the portfolio many smaller longshort equity and eventdriven managers prescribe to the philosophy of keeping their books very concentrated and their analyst teams small this way they gain an edge in the few names they are invested in through focused research of the businesses behind the securities instead of spreading their efforts over dozens of positions “deworsification” is real but with a book this concentrated position sizing becomes just as critical as stock picking if ratan’s largest positions perform worse than their smallest positions they are leaving a lot of money on the table novus clients test this with a metric called position sizing value add ratan capital position sizing it seems the decision to move to a more concentrated investment style has been paying off since the beginning of  the period of increased concentration her sizing decisions have added an impressive  percentage point over the equally weighted return orange line in chart below this implies that the changes the manager is making are substantial and are having a real positive impact on the bottom line it also implies that the manager is skilled at expressing conviction their largest sized positions outperform smaller sized positions the same concept can be seen in the winloss ratios by position size buckets as expected from the chart above ratan does well in their largest positions winloss ratio by position size bucket contribution by position size bucket ratan capital scalability and liquidity we have seen many managers move up the market capitalization spectrum after rapidly growing assets below is the average market capitalization of the stocks in ratan’s portfolio weighted by their positions in each name recently their portfolio has been shifting into mega caps and out of small this move has kept liquidity in check and the fund remains very liquid even at their present concentration levels there does not seem to be any short term issues with scaling the fund further while remaining liquid but in the future if growth persists they might need to think about increasing position count and as a result potentially growing the analyst team covering new securities especially if they want to venture out of the mega cap space ratan capital market capitalization the data implies that this move into larger cap names has been warranted in fact similar to many of their tiger cub peers their highest return and alpha contribution come from larger capitalization stocks annualized return by market cap security selection alpha by market cap ratan capital sectors from her days at balyasny chopra has been a generalist investor not focusing on any one or two sectors rather looking for a “corporate change” in her investments practicing an eventdriven style however as of most recent filings it is clear that she has been riding the healthcare boom currently investing  of the portfolio in the sector down from  in january of this year according to novus framework our attribution framework that breaks returns into four components most of the alpha return above the market and sector returns has been generated in the healthcare sector since the start of the analyzable period in addition some alpha has been generated in consumer discretionary and it while it was lost in staples currently  of the book again this is typical of hedge funds in general as staples is commonly a zero or a negative alpha sector the article we referenced earlier in the post refers to chopra as a brilliant stock picker this seems to only be true in the healthcare sector according to data let’s take a closer look at the actual names ratan capital overlap it is interesting to look at the names that ratan shares with their tiger cub peers our free interactive overlap matrix makes this a simple exercise below is a screen shot of the tool if you click on uniqueness the matrix will sort managers from the most unique to the least unique uniqueness is calculated within the context of this group of tiger cubs so in the case of ratan they fall in the middle of the pack at  uniqueness that’s the portion of their portfolio that is unique only to them and no other tiger cub owns those names in the table to the right of the matrix the unique names are bold you can quickly see that the two largest positions in their portfolio are very commonly held stocks valeant and allergan at  and  cubs respectively thus most of the stock picking alpha in healthcare was actually due to a few very popular tiger cub stocks here are their top contributors since  is ratan capital a leader or follower a team in our product group headed up by adam benenson is building a pioneering analysis to rank all managers based on their ability to be early and right on a stock or to “lead the pack” in conviction trades for instance it’s interesting that ratan has benefited from valeant but were they among the first in that name or simply caught on after others had invested analyzing this only within the context of the tiger cubs we can see that ratan was among the first investors in vrx the third to be exact behind hound and marble arch who were leaders you can see that of the managers that followed suit many had much lower position sizes lower conviction and thus did not benefit as much as the leaders   valeant vrx     tiger cub tenure quarters as of  latest position size hound partners llc   marble arch investments lp   ratan capital group llc   viking global investors lp   hoplite capital management llc   lone pine capital llc   maverick capital ltd   emerging sovereign group llc   steadfast financial llc   tiger eye partners lp     ratan capital’s investment in valeant price vs position size from the chart above we can see how ratan managed the position size of vrx and increased their bets and trimmed at just the right times ratan capital’s similarity to adi capital some investors expressed concern over the fact that chopra’s husband paritosh gupta also runs an event driven fund smaller than ratan called adi capital management a filing with the sec states that “mr gupta and his spouse do not discuss any information related to their funds’ current investments potential investments investment strategies or other confidential investmentrelated information” we ran a simple overlap analysis on the two funds and found two names in common stock ratan capital size adi capital size valeant pharmaceuticals intl  – allergan plc  – time warner cable inc  – charter communications inc   pinnacle foods inc  – coty inc   teva pharmaceuticals  – liberty global plc  – horizon pharma plc  – calpine corp  – fossil group inc put  – ssc technologies hldgs inc  – hilltop holdings inc  –   while the position count of the overlapping securities certainly is low  the portfolios overlap significantly in percent of market value this means that both managers have high conviction in the two names they share roughly  of ratan’s portfolio is owned by adi and  of adi’s is owned by ratan if you were to pull two hedge funds at random their average expected overlap to each other is  according to our latest industry overlap analysis conclusion no doubt ratan capital is a successful tiger seed with potential and is proving their worth with great numbers however it would be wise for investors to understand the source and uniqueness of the alpha in their returns while the stock picking is indeed excellent in healthcare in particular the stocks are by no means unique in the scope of their peers however data points to ratan being leaders in at least some of the popular names and their ability to properly size those names and monetize their conviction is surely responsible for a large chunk of their success   three managers three styles an analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha what makes a successful hedge fund manager we believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question by looking at thousands of active manager portfolios we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance these patterns can be viewed as investment skill or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods in this article we use public ownership data and the novus alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers the three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success investment skill what’s in the report analysis of a top longshort equity fund analysis of a top sector specialist analysis of a top longonly manager download our
