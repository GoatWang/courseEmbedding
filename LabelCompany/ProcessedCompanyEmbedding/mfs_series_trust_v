jeffrey l shames dear shareholders it is over a year since the attacks of september  dealt a sharp blow to the american people and to an alreadyweak us economy when the markets seemed to be recovering as a new year began a series of corporate scandals hammered at the economy and at investor confidence as i write this in early fall investors are concerned about a potential war with iraq and about labor issues on west coast docks which handle nearly half of all us importexport shipping in the midst of all this the american consumer has managed almost singlehandedly to keep the us economy from falling back into recession a relay race in midoctober we could describe the state of the us economy as a relay race against time involving two runners the consumer whose spending has fueled the beginning of a recovery and corporate spending which has yet to contribute much to the recovery the hope is that corporate spending kicks in so that the consumer can pass the baton before running out of steam at this point we see little visibility or ability to predict the nearterm direction of consumer spending or corporate spending and profits the result is that the economy seems to us to be in a holding pattern as we wait for clear signs that things are improving reasons for optimism optimists would point out that wages have been rising over the past year according to the us labor department this in combination with historically low interest rates and inflation may enable the consumer to keep spending in the corporate arena our research indicates that business spending overall has at least stopped falling and that corporate earnings and spending could trend upward next year pessimists however would counter that visibility of corporate profits remains very murky that corporations could resort to further layoffs if profits languish and that the situation with iraq adds to market uncertainty the fact is that the nearterm direction of the market or the economy is uncertain but history has shown that both are cyclical  downturns have always been followed by upturns staying the course with the economy in a holding pattern and markets extremely volatile we think its important to remember the familiar investment strategies that we believe apply in any market think long term be diversified see crises as opportunities thats how wed describe our approach to this volatile environment  which we think plays to our strength as researchbased bottom up longterm investors as always we appreciate your confidence in mfs and welcome any questions or comments you may have respectfully s jeffrey l shames jeffrey l shames chairman mfs investment managementr october   the opinions expressed in this letter are those of mfs and no forecasts can be guaranteed

return of  class a shares  class b shares  class b shares  class c shares  class c shares  and class i shares  these returns assume the reinvestment of any dividends and capital gains distributions but exclude the effects of any sales charges and compare over the same period with returns of  and  respectively for the funds benchmarks the standard  poors  stock index the sp  and the lehman brothers aggregate bond index the sp  is a commonly used measure of broad stock market performance the lehman brothers aggregate bond index is unmanaged and is composed of all publicly issued obligations of the us treasury and government agencies all corporate debt guaranteed by the us government all fixedrate nonconvertible investmentgrade domestic corporate debt and all fixedrate securities backed by mortgage pools of the government national mortgage association gnma the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and the federal national mortgage association fnma during the same period the average balanced fund tracked by lipper inc an independent firm that reports mutual fund performance returned  q how would you describe the environment for the fund over the past  months a the past  months have been very difficult for stock investors but not for fixedincome investors the equity markets were negatively influenced in the fall of  by the aftermath of september  then by deteriorating economic conditions corporate accounting scandals and uncertainties about war with iraq continuing a trend that had begun in  a companys announcement of lower than expected earnings resulted in severe price declines that affected not only its stock but often its entire industry the bond portion of the portfolio was positively influenced by us federal reserve board interest rate cuts early in the period and flat rates for the past six months q the funds returns were better than the s  p  why is that a in our opinion the funds outperformance of the benchmark was attributable to the bond portion of the portfolio and to our value focus on stocks with solid earnings that are priced below what we think theyre worth our bond holdings which at the end of the period were at about  provided income and some stability to the overall portfolio value stocks outperformed growth stocks over the past  months q what were the biggest contributors to performance a energy and financial stocks did the best for us relative to our benchmark we were overweighted in energy especially oil services and exploration and production companies oil prices remained high throughout the period attributable in part to tensions in the middle east banks and insurance companies were among our most successful financial stocks the bank stocks we held did well because interest rates were low their mortgage business was booming and there were fewer than expected credit problems after september  property and casualty insurers were able to raise premiums to help cover earlier losses q what were some of the ideas that didnt work for the fund a holdings in pharmaceuticals utilities and telecommunications detracted from fund performance in our view bristolmyers squibb best illustrates the woes of the pharmaceutical industry although many of its older drugs were coming off patent protection we believed they had many new drugs in development that would make up for the ones theyd be losing unfortunately the new drugs were not approved by federal regulators and the companys earnings suffered our utilities holdings which included energy generation companies and telephone companies were also disappointing calpine an independent company that develops power plants and sells energy built too much generating capacity and accumulated too much debt in the process telecommunications companies performed poorly as a result of having created too much capacity and fierce competition q what sort of opportunities are you seeing going forward a were still attracted to the longterm prospects of pharmaceuticals after a year of falling prices pharmaceutical stocks have been attractively valued in our opinion railroad stocks interest us because many have been selling at low prices relative to their earnings these companies have been generating good yields and theyve been making money we believe they should continue to do well when the economy recovers on the bond side we favor highgrade corporate bonds in healthcare utilities and defense industries as well as government agencies and mortgage backed issues we believe that these bonds should do well in almost any economic climate and offer us potentially better yields than us treasury securities the principal value and interest on treasury securities are guaranteed by the us government if held to maturity q what is your outlook going forward a there will be an economic recovery eventually we are cautiously optimistic about that and own more cyclical stocks as a result we have found paper and chemical companies to be attractive in our view they have offered competitive dividend yields that we believe will help compensate for any nearterm uncertainty and their prices should respond quickly when an economic recovery does occur s david m calabro david m calabro lead portfolio manager on behalf of the mfs total return team the opinions expressed in this report are those of the portfolio manager

political conditions of the countries where investments are made there may be greater returns but also greater risk than with us investments investments in lowerrated securities may provide greater returns but may have greaterthanaverage risk the portfolio may invest in mortgagebacked securities which are subject to unique interest and maturity risks when interest rates fall mortgages may be paid early through refinancing which may shorten the expected maturity of these securities alternatively when interest rates rise mortgages are not likely to be paid early which may lengthen the expected maturity of these securities therefore during times of fluctuating interest rates these factors may cause the value of mortgagebacked securities to increase or decrease more than those of

director at   division of investment management office of investment company regulation end further info end preamble start supplemental information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  each trust is organized as a massachusetts business trust and is registered under the act as an openend management investment company each trust may consist of one or more series and may offer additional series in the future “funds” mfs a delaware corporation is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  and start printed page serves as the investment adviser to each fund  some funds including money market funds that rely on rule a under the act “money market funds” may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements purchasing other shortterm instruments or in the case of funds other than the money market funds investing in the mfs institutional money market fund “immf” pursuant to rule d under the act other funds may borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash payment for a security sold by a fund has been delayed or for other temporary purposes currently the trusts have a committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders and uncommitted lines of credit with two separate banks collectively the “loan agreements” the funds also have an overdraft facility with their custodians  if a fund were to borrow money under a loan agreement the fund would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other nonborrowing funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other shortterm instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan in addition while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails the borrowing funds incur commitment fees andor other charges involved in obtaining a bank loan  applicants request an order that would permit each trust to enter into master interfund lending agreements “interfund lending agreements” that would permit each fund to lend and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other fund through a credit facility “interfund loan” applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would reduce the funds borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher interest rates on shortterm lendings although the proposed credit facility would reduce the funds need to borrow from banks the funds would be free to establish or renew committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with unaffiliated banks  applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing fund with significant savings when the cash position of the fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements this situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and certain funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions when a fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days or longer for certain foreign transactions the credit facility would provide a source of immediate shortterm liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities  applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities “fails” due to circumstances such as a delay in the delivery of cash to a funds custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction sales fails may present a cash shortfall if a fund has undertaken to purchase securities using the proceeds from the securities sold as a result the fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale resulting in additional cost to the fund or sell a security on a sameday settlement basis earning a lower return on the investment use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the fund to have access to immediate shortterm liquidity  while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails under the proposed credit facility a borrowing fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on shortterm loans in addition funds making shortterm cash loans directly to other funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements thus applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending funds  the interest rate charged to a fund on any interfund loan “interfund loan rate” would be the average of the “repo rate” and the “bank loan rate” both as defined below the repo rate on any day would be the highest rate available to a lending fund from investing in overnight repurchase agreements the bank loan rate on any day would be calculated by the “interfund lending committee” as defined below each day an interfund loan is made according to a formula established by each funds board of trustees “fund board” intended to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank shortterm loans would be available to the funds the formula would be based upon a publicly available rate eg federal funds rates andor libor plus an additional spread of basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates the initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each fund board each fund board would at least annually review the continuing appropriateness of using the method of calculating the bank loan rate as well as the relationship between the bank loan rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the funds  the credit facility would be administered by investment professionals and administrative personnel from mfs the “interfund lending committee” no portfolio manager including research analysts with portfolio management responsibilities for any fund will serve as a member of the interfund lending committee under the proposed credit facility senior members of mfs investment management team and senior administrative and management personnel the “investment management committee” or a portfolio manager for each participating fund could provide standing instructions to the interfund lending committee that the participating fund is authorized to participate as a borrower or lender alternatively the portfolio manager could provide instructions from time to time as to when the fund wishes to participate as a borrower or a lender the interfund lending committee no more frequently than once daily in the morning of each business day that a transaction is requested under the credit facility pursuant to instructions an “interfund lending day” would request and collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating funds from the funds custodian once it has determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand the interfund lending committee would allocate loans among borrowing funds without any further communication from a funds portfolio managers applicants expect there will typically be more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand after the interfund lending committee start printed page has allocated cash for interfund loans mfs cash desk personnel would invest any remaining cash in accordance with the funds investment policies and practices in the ordinary course  the interfund lending committee would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the funds on what the interfund lending committee believes to be an equitable basis subject to certain administrative considerations applicable to all participating funds such as the time of filing requests to participate minimum loan lot sizes the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs and the amount of the existing borrowings outstanding to reduce transaction costs each interfund loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction the method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each fund board including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined in section a of the act “independent fund board members” to ensure that both borrowing and lending funds participate on an equitable basis  the interfund lending committee would a monitor the interfund loan rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans b limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each fund to ensure that they comply with the funds investment policies and limitations c ensure equitable treatment of each fund and d directly or through mfs make quarterly reports to each fund board concerning any transactions by the funds under the credit facility and the interfund loan rate charged  mfs through the interfund lending committee would administer the credit facility as a fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management contract with each fund and provide administrative support pursuant to the administrative services agreement between each fund and mfs and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services  no fund may participate in the credit facility unless a the fund has obtained shareholder approval for its participation if such approval is required by law b the fund has fully disclosed all material information concerning the credit facility in its prospectus andor statement of additional information “sai” and c the funds participation in the credit facility is consistent with its investment objectives limitations and organizational documents  in connection with the credit facility applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting relief from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting relief from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting relief from sections a a and a of the act and d under section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person applicants state that the funds may be under common control by virtue of having mfs as their common investment adviser andor by having a common fund board and officers  section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the act and with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below  applicants submit that sections a and b of the act were intended to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests to and some influence over the investment decisions of a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of such party and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because a mfs through the interfund lending committee would administer the program as a fiduciary b all interfund loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the lending fund otherwise would invest in shortterm repurchase agreements or other shortterm instruments c the interfund loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments d the lending fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could otherwise obtain through such other investments and e the borrowing fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements moreover applicants believe that the other terms and conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other fund  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of an affiliated person from selling any securities or other property to the company section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing fund to repay an interfund loan may constitute a security for the purposes of sections a and d applicants also state that any pledge of assets in connection with an interfund loan could be construed as a purchase of the borrowing funds securities or other property for purposes of section a of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants contend that the standards under sections c b and dj are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections start printed page a and b and for the reasons discussed below applicants also state that the requested relief from section a of the act meets the standards of section c and b because any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing if the lender is another fund or the same or less restrictive conditions in any other circumstance any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan will be available solely to secure repayment of such interfund loan  applicants state that among other things section d was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid imposing on investors additional and duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses applicants note that there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the funds or shareholders and that mfs will receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility through the interfund lending committee applicants also note that the entire purpose of the proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all of the participating funds and their shareholders  section f of the act prohibits openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank provided that immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness applicants request relief from section f to the limited extent necessary to implement the credit facility because the lending funds are not banks  applicants believe that granting relief under section c is appropriate because the funds would remain subject to the requirement of section f that all borrowings of a fund including combined interfund and bank borrowings have at least  asset coverage based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application applicants also submit that to allow the funds to borrow from other funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section f  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally

current investment and economic environment bears little resemblance to last years one year ago global economies were floundering and the crisis in asia threatened an already weak us economy corporate earnings were flat and economists used the word deflation for the first time in recent memory entering  expectations for corporate earnings growth were lowered dramatically in an attempt to foster us growth the federal reserve board the fed lowered interest rates as a result this year the us economy is booming and unemployment is low many corporations are focused on improving their profitability and investors have been rewarded with positive surprises across a variety of industries our analysts predict that corporate earnings growth for  will average    global economies also are showing signs of strength and the asian crisis has passed in fact japans economic woes seem to have reached bottom although the process is in its infancy some japanese corporations not only are talking about restructuring and cost cutting they also are beginning to take action looking within to become more competitive and improve returns on equity while still lagging the united states europe is beginning to restructure and consolidate these signs of international growth have contributed to concerns that the us economy now may be too strong in june and again in august the fed raised rates by onequarter of a percentage point to help ward off the specter of inflation after an unprecedented four years of  annual returns in the us equity market we fear that many investors have become accustomed to high returns and have lost sight of the risks they take on to achieve them in the current market many investors are taking on additional risk  whether through day trading or investing in speculative internet stocks risks are as much a part of the market today as they were one year ago we believe the market remains overvalued with stocks priced  above our analysts earnings projections and market narrowness has not abated the top  stocks in the standard  poors  composite index a popular unmanaged index of common stock total return performance are still the most overvalued such extreme overvaluation makes the stock market sensitive to interestrate news and any negative earnings surprises the year  yk computer problem is another factor causing investor concern while we believe corporate america is well prepared to address any yk situations that may arise at yearend no one can predict investor behavior in our opinion it is investor behavior that has the greatest potential to create market volatility we believe the best way to address yk and other market risks is through our continuing commitment to mfs original researchr and our fundamental investment tenet of longterm investing whether markets are up or down mfs analysts focus on analyzing industries and visiting companies to determine the longterm winners and the prices that will make them attractive opportunities because all companies will not benefit equally from the improving international environment bottomup research remains critical to identifying those that we believe are successfully restructuring consolidating and gaining market share changes in market and economic conditions cant be predicted but should always be expected the changes we have seen over the past year only reinforce our commitment to longterm planning and investing we believe volatility helps to create opportunity for longterm investors to buy solid companies at attractive prices for this reason we are continuing to expand our domestic and international capabilities to ensure that mfs has primary inhouse research on companies worldwide we believe that we have built the right investment team backed by mfs original research to take advantage of those opportunities for our shareholders we appreciate your confidence and welcome any questions or comments you may have respectfully s jeffrey l shames jeffrey l shames

brothers governmentcorporate bond index the lehman index an unmanaged marketvalueweighted index of us treasury and governmentagency securities that excludes mortgagebacked securities returned  according to lipper analytical services inc an independent firm that reports mutual fund performance the average balanced fund returned  during the period q whats behind the stock markets strong performance over the past year a we started out with stocks at a low and a lot of fear driving the market fortunately the federal reserve board lowered interest rates at the end of september  and again in october that along with progress overseas restored investor confidence and the market took off strong economic growth at home kept the market climbing throughout the winter and spring with largecompany growth stocks taking the lead value stocks lagged considerably and only rebounded briefly last april and may growth stocks moved back into favor during the summer but gave up some ground late in the period as investors worried about valuation levels earnings disappointments a weaker dollar and the possibility of higher interest rates q why has it been such a challenging time for value stocks  and the fund a value stocks are usually in mature industries such as energy financials and industrials that need to be able to raise prices to grow earnings unfortunately there really hasnt been any pricing flexibility in the economy during the period so that has hurt the value names by contrast growth stocks tend to have proprietary products and high gross margins so they dont really need price increases obviously a balanced fund like ours  which typically has about  of its assets in fixedincome investments and  in stocks  is going to lag when the stock market is favoring growth stocks our fund also has a value orientation  a style weve followed for the past  years as a result we didnt own many top performing technology stocks during the period but we did have sizable investments in weaker sectors like financials and electric utilities we take a longterm approach however and stick with our discipline regardless of whats in favor over long periods the returns on growth and value stocks have been very similar q why did you hold on to financials and electric utilities a we saw good value in financials especially insurance companies we focused on companies with strong prospects like hartford financial heres a solid company with a strong management team and demonstrated earnings growth plus the company looks like a good acquisition candidate in an industry where consolidation seems imminent the stock has been disappointing lately but we believe it has strong potential chubb is another example of a company with good assets that has struggled because of weak pricing we think prices will most likely move up so we held on by contrast we trimmed our stake in electric utilities which had disappointing earnings since deregulation is taking longer than expected we decided there were better opportunities elsewhere q which stocks were among your best performers during the period a some of our best returns came from the energy and telecommunications sectors rising oil prices a promising supplydemand outlook and industry consolidation helped boost energy stocks bp amoco our largest investment also did well during the period thanks to synergies from its recent amos merger and the prospect of new ones from its purchase of arco our holdings in mobil which is being acquired by exxon and coastal corp a diversified energy company also posted strong gains for the period in the telecommunications sector stocks continued to benefit from tremendous growth in wireless communications and the internet we had sizable stakes in gte and bell atlantic both of which did especially well following the announcement of their merger sprint was another strong performer we also benefited from owning stocks like alliedsignal which took off after its announced merger with honeywell time warner which rebounded as investors recognized the value of its cable assets mcdonalds which changed its growth strategy in the united states and american express which continued to deliver doubledigit earnings growth q where else have you found good values a were always looking for strong companies that have stumbled for example we bought shares of motorola  a technology company whose stock was selling at a discount due to problems in its cellular handset division and a slump in semiconductor sales industry wide the stock has since made a great comeback we also added to natural gas utilities including sonat and el paso which have steady cash flows from their gas pipelines and also benefit from rising oil prices in their exploration and production businesses another area we like is europe where corporations are way behind the united states in terms of restructuring as companies like royal dutch smithkline beecham and akzo nobel reorganize and cut costs to compete globally we expect to see better earnings growth by the end of the period we had drained down our cash and increased our equity stake to  of net assets up from  a year earlier q did you make changes on the bond side of the portfolio a not many we continued to keep roughly  of our net assets in bonds with about twothirds of that in corporate bonds and the rest in us treasuries and mortgagebacked securities we did however lower the funds duration  an indicator of its sensitivity to changes in interest rates  to  years from  years we did this last winter because we expected the bias on interest rates to be up and the shorter a bonds duration the less its price will fall as interest rates rise to shorten duration we increased our stake in bonds that mature in less than two years this turned out to be the right move given that interest rates did move up during the period since then bonds have pretty much stayed within a narrow range as inflation concerns have battled flat inflation numbers q whats your outlook for the coming six months a we expect strong but more moderate economic growth with few inflation worries there appears to be an upward bias on interest rates given the current strength of the us economy and high employment levels and any rise in interest rates would cool off the economy a bit regardless of what happens we believe the bonds we own should continue to provide the fund with steady income and a measure of downside protection on the stock side were cautious about the overall market given how high valuations are however we feel the funds longterm value focus and bond weighting should help us over the long term to weather whatever volatility lies ahead s david m calabro david m calabro lead portfolio
