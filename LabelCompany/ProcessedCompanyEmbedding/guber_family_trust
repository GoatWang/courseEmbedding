brouhaha over ancient coins uncategorized  court brouhaha over ancient coins matt reynolds july        los angeles cn – a businessman sued a rare coin dealer for more than  million claiming the la dealer refuses to return several ancient greek coins and a bronze roman head of lucius aelius verus as caesar     peter guber as trustee for the guber family trust sued dealers robert freeman and tory freeman partners in freeman  sear on july  in superior court     guber an art and antique collector and entrepreneur claims that from  he bought and sold ancient coins through the dealers “without incident” in that time he says he built a collection of  greek coins     in  guber says agreed to let the freemans take possession of the coins so they could sell them for him on consignment the coin dealers sold  of the coins and relying on their advice guber says he agreed to trade  of the remaining coins for a bronze roman head of lucius aelius verus as caesar     lucius aelius varus  was an adopted son of hadrian he died before he attained the emperorship     guber claims the freemans told him they would auction the bronze head in paris on june   for up to  million     that left four unsold ancient silver coins the oldest of which dates back to  bc guber says he says he allowed the freemans to keep the coins based on an understanding that they would eventually sell them     though the freemans in june  told guber they had aborted plans to sell the bronze head in paris they promised they would continue to try to sell it guber says     but by march this year the coins and bronze head were still looking for a new owner guber says he asked the freemans to return his property     “later on march   mr guber discovered that defendants were sued by larry goldberg coins  collectibles inc goldberg in that lawsuit los angeles superior court case no sci goldberg alleges among other things that defendants pledged as security for a debt owed by defendants the bronze head and possibly some or all of the missing coins mr guber was unaware of this pledge and at no time consented to the use of the trust’s property as collateral for the debts of defendants” the july  complaint states     the first lawsuit filed in august  and obtained by courthouse news claimed that the freemans had defrauded goldberg bought coins under an alias without paying for them bounced checks and delayed payments goldberg sought  million in damages     guber says that despite the freemans’ assurances they have not returned the bronze head and coins     he seeks  in damages and an order that forces the freemans to return them     he is represented by mark campbell with loeb  loeb     freeman and sear did not immediately respond to a request for comment tuesday click to share on
