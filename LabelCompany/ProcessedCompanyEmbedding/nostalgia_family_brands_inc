multinational companies including but not limited to nestle kraft foods mars proctor  gamble and unilever as well as smaller competitors many of whom have already established their brand name recognition in our proposed markets in addition many of our competitors have significantly larger marketing personnel and financial resources than we have and competition for shelf space in grocery stores and other retail outlets is intense costly and poses great difficulty for smaller food and consumer product companies and distributors we intend to offer distinctive products which address specific consumer needs we will target the senior population where nostalgia is expected to be a strong motivator for purchases however these efforts will not guarantee that we will be competitive or that our business plan will be successful further we intend to compete with other companies that see the value of reintroducing discontinued product brands we believe that competition is based primarily upon availability price quality and efficacy of products customer service brand name recognition and marketing and trade support and successful product introductions company description we aim to acquire ownership and other rights to discontinued consumer product brands with the ultimate goal of reviving these products and commercializing them based on an idea that nostalgia for such brands will be a powerful incentive to purchase among the senior population we believe that many formerly popular brand names that were discontinued by their parent companies still resonate with the senior population and if so revived and made available in supermarkets and other retail establishments would attract this population and others as consumers  proposed products we intend to target for purchase the intellectual property and other rights to discontinued consumer product brands we consider a product to be discontinued if it is no longer available at traditional retail levels such as grocery and drug stores or on the internet we do not currently own any brand names or have any products for sale to date we have researched over  discontinued products and are focusing upon  of these products in following three categories of consumer products candy food other than candy and personal products as follows  candy bitolicorice big yank old nick and hollywood candy bars  food other than candy amazo instant dessert ballard cornbread mix cocomalt hydrox cookies krumbles cereal ann page pork and beans pep cereal puffa puffa rice cereal and van camps chili con carne  personal products calox tooth powder chipso laundry soap forhans for the gums rapid shave shower mate stopette deodorant and sun n surf we hope to acquire at least one product from each category some of the product brands we intend to target for acquisition are in the public domain while the rights to others are still owned by companies from whom we would endeavor to acquire the manufacturing and distribution rights either upon a royalty basis or outright purchase there can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring rights to any of the above targeted products or any other discontinued products we do not believe that any of our targeted products are available on the internet or at the retail level  we were incorporated on november   under the laws of the state of delaware our

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of trustees of clough global equity fund in planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of clough global equity fund the “ fund ”  as of and for the seven months ended october   in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states we considered the fund ’ s internal control over financial reporting including controls over safeguarding securities as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of form nsar but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the fund ’ s internal control over financial reporting  accordingly we express no such opinion the management of the fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting  in fulfilling this responsibility estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls  a fund ’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  a fund ’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of a fund ’ s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis  a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the fund ’ s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis our consideration of the fund ’ s internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the public company accounting oversight board united states  however we noted no deficiencies in the fund ’ s internal control over financial reporting and its operation including controls over safeguarding securities that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of october   this report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the board of trustees of the fund
