only for falling interest rates we determine the risk profile of each fixedincome security and construct portfolios to reflect the combination of risks that we find most worth taking we can tap into a

retirement plan the “plan” against the plan’s fiduciaries the lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated the employee retirement income security act “erisa” by promoting their own mutual fund business and maximizing profits at the expense of the plan and its participants among other things the lawsuit alleges that the defendants filled the plan exclusively with putnam’s own highcost poor performing mutual funds without regard to whether plan participants would be better served by other investments the lawsuit alleges that the selection of these proprietary mutual funds cost plan participants millions of dollars in excess fees the lawsuit further alleges that the defendants added funds with little to no performance history and failed to remove poor performing funds from the plan the lawsuit seeks to recover the plan’s financial losses and to obtain equitable and other relief from the defendants as a remedy for their violations of erisa a copy of the complaint is here for
