broker center search hologic holx product pipeline strong competition rife june    am edt by zacks equity research zackscom shutterstock photo on jun  we issued an updated research report on hologic inc holx  headquartered in bedford ma the company manufactures mammography systems for breast examination and osteoporosis assessment hologic currently carries a zacks rank  hold over the past one year hologic has been trading above the zacks categorized medical  instruments industry the company has gained  when compared to the  gain of the broader industry we are encouraged to note that the company is constantly making efforts to expand its business hologic recently announced the receipt of fda clearance to market the aptima herpes simplex virus hsv    molecular assay on the fully automated panther system also the company announced that the us fda has granted an expanded clearance for cynosures noninvasive body contouring product sculpsure to treat the back as well as inner and outer thighs in february hologic launched a nextgeneration novasure advanced product in the us for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding further the company announced fda approvals for two important new diagnostic assays these are viral load tests for hiv and the hepatitis c virus hologic also announced that its aptima zika virus diagnostic assay received ce mark in europe for the detection and diagnosis of the zika virus in patients management also continues to expect us regulatory clearance for its hepatitis b assay in  the companys strong product pipeline is also encouraging in this regard hologic is working on innovation and product launches at diagnostics it recently filed for regulatory approval of its aptima hepatitis c viral load test in the us and anticipates the product launch in  following the introduction of its hiv viral load assay under the breast health segment hologic has focused its rd strategy on continuous innovation to fortify its leadership position in d mammography meanwhile the affirm prone biopsy system and upcoming brevera products are likely to provide realtime specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and patient experience this apart the company acquired medicor its longtime distributor of breast and skeletal health products in germany austria and switzerland this opens up considerable scope for the company and also helps it to gain direct access to customers moreover the medicare payment rates which came into effect on jan   will allow providers in the us to determine coverage policies specific to screening and diagnostic d mammography management expects the new medicare payment rates to allow more women to gain access to this d screening test which is the only one approved by the fda as clinically superior to standard mammography we believe the availability of reimbursement for d mammography coupled with the substantial body of published studies which showed positive results in favor of the d test will boost demand for the same on the flip side foreign exchange headwinds continue to affect the companys international performance hologic operates in a highly competitive industry its

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
