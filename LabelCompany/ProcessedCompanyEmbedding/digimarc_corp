object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

world to give digital identities to media and objects that computers can sense and recognize and to which they can react we have developed digimarc discoverr digimarc barcode and the intuitive computing platformtm that are designed to optimize the identification of all consumer brand impressions wherever and whenever they may appear facilitating modern mobilecentric shopping the platform includes means to embed digimarc barcodes invisible and inaudible barcodelike information that is recognizable by smartphones tablets industrial scanners and other computer interfaces into virtually all forms of media content including consumer product packaging digimarc barcodes have many applications including facilitating remarkably faster scanning of products at retail checkout as well as improved engagement with smartphoneequipped consumers the digimarc barcode is robust yet imperceptible by people in ordinary use allowing for reliable efficient economical globally scalable automatic identification of media without visible computer codes like traditional barcodes our media identification and discovery innovations enable our business partners to create numerous applications across a wide range of media content including solutions that improve the speed of retail checkout provide simple and intuitive mobile customer engagement experiences in stores quickly and reliably identify and effectively manage music movies television programming digital images epublications documents and other printed materials especially in light of nonlinear distribution over the internet deter counterfeiting of money media and goods and piracy of epublications movies and music support new digital media distribution models and methods to monetize media content leverage the power of ubiquitous computing to instantly link consumers to a wealth of information andor interactive experiences related to the media and objects they encounter each day provide consumers with more choice and access to media content when where and how they want it enhance imagery and video by associating metadata or authenticating media content for government and commercial uses and better secure identity documents to enhance national security and combat identity theft and fraud our intuitive computing platform has a proprietary foundation in signal processing innovation known as digital watermarking which allows imperceptible digital information to be embedded in all forms of digitally designed produced or distributed media content and many physical objects including photographs movies music television personal identification documents financial instruments industrial parts and product packages we refer to the embedded information as the digimarc barcode this digital information can be detected and read by a wide range of computers smartphones tablets and other digital devices our inventions allow our business partners and customers to provide persistent digital identities for virtually any media content that is digitally processed at some point during its lifecycle our technology can be applied to printed materials video audio and images to supply a wide range of consumer engagement media management and security solutions across multiple consumer and government industry sectors over the years our enabling software and business processes and associated intellectual property portfolio have grown to encompass many related technologies we provide our solutions directly and through our business partners our inventions provide a powerful element of document security giving rise to a longterm relationship with a consortium of central banks the central banks and many leading companies in the information technology industry we and our business partners have successfully propagated the use of our technology in music movies television broadcasts digital images epublications and printed materials digimarc barcodes have been used in these applications to improve media rights and asset management reduce piracy and counterfeiting losses improve marketing programs permit more efficient and effective distribution of valuable media content and enhance consumer entertainment and commercial experiences digimarc barcodes can be used to enhance all forms of media and are imperceptible to human senses but quickly detected by computers networks or other digital devices like smartphones and tablets unlike traditional barcodes and tags our solution does not require publishers to give up valuable visual space in magazines and newspapers nor does it impact the overall layout or aesthetics of the publication for readers digimarc barcodes are generally imperceptible in normal use and do all that visible barcodes do but perform better our digimarc discover platform delivers a range of rich media experiences to its readers on their smartphones or tablets across multiple media formats including print audio video and packaging unique to the digimarc discover platform is its seamless multimodel use of various content identification technologies as needed including digimarc barcode when present in january  we introduced digimarc barcodes for use in consumer product packaging these digimarc barcodes can contain the same information found in traditional universal product codes upc the upc information is invisibly repeated multiple times over the entire package surface we partnered with datalogic a global leader in automatic data capture and industrial automation markets and producer of barcode readers in introducing the digimarc barcode to the consumer product packaging market the first retail scanner enabled was datalogics magellantm i multiplane imaging scanner since then additional scanner vendors and other channel partners have announced support for the digimarc barcode platform digimarc barcodes can also connect mobileenabled consumers directly from packaging to engaging mobile experiences such as additional product information special offers recommendations reviews social networks and more our intellectual property contains many innovations in digital watermarking content recognition sometimes referred to as fingerprinting digital rights management and related fields to protect our inventions we have implemented an extensive intellectual property protection program that relies on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and nondisclosure agreements and other contracts as a result we believe we have one of the worlds most extensive patent portfolios in digital watermarking and related fields with over  granted and pending patents as of june   we continue to develop and broaden our portfolio in the fields of media identification and management technology and related applications and systems we devote significant resources to developing and protecting our inventions and continuously seek to identify and evaluate potential licensees for our patents the patents in our portfolio have a life of approximately  years from the effective filing date and up to  years after the patent has been granted the market for patent licensing has become more challenging in recent years as a result we have shifted our focus from direct monetization via enforcement and licensing to facilitating progress toward the realization of our vision to enrich everyday living via pervasive intuitive computing by encouraging large scale adoption of our technologies by industry leaders improving our financial performance by enhancing our competitive differentiation increasing the scale and rate of growth of our products and services business and laying a foundation for continuing innovation for a discussion of activities

annually these contracts generally provide for billing hours worked at predetermined rates and to a lesser extent reimbursement for third party costs and services increases or decreases in the services provided under these contracts are generally subject to both volume and price changes the volume of work is generally negotiated at least annually and can be modified as the customers needs change we also have provisions in our longer term contracts that allow for specific hourly rate price increases on an annual basis to account for cost of living variables contracts with government agency contractors are generally shorter term in nature less linear in billings and less predictable than our longer term contracts because the contracts with government agency contractors are subject to government budgets and funding the increases in service revenue for the three and six month periods ended june   compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ended june   were
