technology inc  princeternships  princeternships  princeton university search deborah sandoval ’ prescription advisory systems and technology inc posted on august   by dottie day  i arrived sharply at  am to past inc headquarters a collection of offices hiding above panera on nassau street along with two other princeterns kevin pardinas ‘ and katherine lee ‘ our host joe studholme ‘ gathered us into the conference room to introduce himself and his newly founded company mr studholme chairman of colonial club’s grad board and ceo of past inc informed us about his experiences with startups sharing his story about leaving princeton his senior year to join a company that would eventually go “belly up” and showing us his “tombstone” – a plaque representing a million dollar deal for his former company having been successful with his previous startup mr studholme explained that he now had a better chance of attracting investors and of course a better idea of how to make this company grow mr studholme then quickly briefed us on the background of his product a surprisingly large number of people die each year from prescription drug abuse and being prescribed a deadly combination of drugs – common costly and deadly problems in united states healthcare today doctors are pressed to see as many patients as possible in a limited amount of time and cannot afford to do a thorough analysis of a patient’s medical background information mr studholme’s product addresses this problem and allows meaningful information to be viewed efficiently– helping prevent lawsuits abuse and most importantly injuries or deaths he gave us a tour of his product so that we became familiar enough to begin our first assignment we were asked to find ways to represent the data provided by a fitbit® a wearable fitnessmonitoring device so that it was meaningful our first assignment quickly immersed us in the developing stages of the company – our findings were to be implemented in the product and pitched to the client as soon as possible as a group the princeterns researched discussed debated and finally presented our findings to mr studholme and his team we were given some feedback and would continue to shape this project the next day day  essentially we were back to the drawing board so we headed straight to work with the feedback from yesterday in mind i felt very productive and fulfilled knowing that our efforts would be manifested in the product since we all had technical backgrounds in computer science mr studholme thought we would benefit from seeing the technical perspective of the startup we met with the software programmers who gave us a thorough overview of how the product is structured and run the programmers emphasized on separating modules and implementation to make for easier changes – a very important theme i learned in my computer science classes it was fascinating to see the applications of computer science in a “realworld” setting since there was currently no patient data the programmers explained that they had to create mock data in order to show clients what the product does and will do with that in mind we created mock data for the patients seen in the product demo so that it would be easier to implement when we were finished with our project we wrapped up our work and prepared to present in a web meetingconference call at  am the next day day  we presented our project to mr studholme who was on a train at the time heading to an important meeting and his staff once more and received additional feedback on how to improve and take into consideration some pitfalls in our calculations and displays however we were on the right track and much closer to getting it right the other princeterns and i began to discuss and consider the pros and cons of all our options slowly eliminating each one until we decided on the most efficient and lesstime consuming feature for the client we then presented our final project to chief legal advisor ahmet bayazitoglu ‘ and business development director douglas blair ‘ who agreed that our version of displaying data was most efficient we asked the staff questions about how they became involved with past inc as well as their roles and expectations for the company they provided invaluable insight on careers and networking after princeton and with that we closed a fascinating and exciting experience with prescription advisory systems and technology inc i sincerely thank our host mr joe studholme for opening his company to three interested princeton students and for providing a quality experience that will influence our future perspectives and careers i would also like to thank ahmet bayazitoglu douglas blair vin shelton ‘ jeanette thomson ‘ and the rest of the staff for offering their knowledge sincere advice and help in making this possible pages welcome career services categories architecture  arts and entertainment  communications  consulting

archives prescription advisory systems and technology inc kevin pardinas ’ prescription advisory systems and technology inc posted on august   by dottie my princeternship experience commenced with a very delicious lunch the day before the internship started after briefly meeting the ceo of past mr joe studholme ’ one of the other princeterns katherine lee ’ and i had lunch with mr ahmet bayazitoglu and mr doug blair two employees of past inc who told us more about the company and what we would be doing mr bayazitoglu and mr blair told us about the aims of past over a delicious meal at an indian restaurant in princeton they explained that their main goal is efficiency and described their product and its objective katherine and i told them a little about ourselves and we talked about what we were studying at princeton it was a great lunch and i learned a lot of valuable information about the company past inc utilizes technology to provide better patient information to doctors regarding drug dosages and prescriptions its objective is to combat the high number of annual deaths that are due to errors in drug prescription the present system of recording medical data for patients based on tabulation of data is inefficient and truthfully outdated i was excited to begin working with the individuals at past and helping them create a better system day  katherine and i were joined by deborah sandoval ’ the third princetern who would be part of the team we arrived at the office at  am where we formally met mr studholme and were introduced to everyone else in the company we set up shop in the conference room of the past office where mr studholme showed the three of us a presentation with much more detail on the aims of the company and their future outlook he also talked a little about himself and his previous success with another startup we got to see the company’s actual product as well as the market potential for it we were told about the parts of the final product that were still under construction and with which we would be working one of the aspects he focused on was a part of the program that they hoped could read data from a fitbit and give doctors useful information about the patient wearing the device after this we were given an assignment to work on the goal of the assignment was to use mock fitbit data and create two graphs that could be incorporated into the design of the final product one graph would show the fitness level of a patient as calculated with the information obtained from the fitbit and the other would chart doctor efficiency by using the fitness data from the first graph and showing how much the health of the patient improved or worsened with the prescribed amount of drug dosage mr studholme had a meeting so deborah katherine and i worked diligently for the rest of the day taking a lunch break at panera day  my fellow princeterns and i arrived at the office ready to continue working on the project from day  we got the opportunity to meet with the developers of the product who showed us the code behind the application we worked with the developers on thinking of how to actually get what we had designed into the company’s application upon speaking to them we decided that it might be a good idea to have fitness data in a separate graph from the main chart that contained the prescription information the reason for this is that we felt that the graph was going to be too cluttered with added information deborah katherine and i prepared a presentation for mr studholme to show him what we had developed upon presenting he gave us advice on the way we could fix our graphs we had calculated the fitness level using a formula involving steps taken and hours active but mr studholme recommended that we only take into account steps taken and weight for those were the only two things that the fitbit could truly record accurately we began working on new better graphs and took a lunch break we were invited to lunch by the company and we helped everyone at past by going to cvs and getting some soft drinks to fill the fridge after sharing some great stories at lunch and getting to know each other better we decided to take a new approach for the models we were to make heeding the advice of mr studholme and creating a new equation for the fitness level involving steps taken by the individual we got three mock patients and created data for an entire year date consistent with the mock patient data the developers had hard coded into the product in order to test it we made graphs for steps taken and weight and prepared a powerpoint for a presentation we would have the next day day  traversing through the cold and snowy january weather we got to the office at  am for the third and final day of our princeternship mr studholme was in a presentation in boston so we had a conference call with everyone in the company using a powerpoint presentation we presented our ideas we were able to superimpose our fitness level graph as well as our data for weight on top of the currently existing primary chart in the application we also made separate graphs to allow them to see which might be a better option we were given some final suggestions and comments and proceeded to make our final product we decided to consider sleep as suggested by one of the company members during the conference call for some drugs may have effects or sideeffects related to sleeping and it would be good for a doctor to be able to get this kind of information from the fitbit we also added the ability to toggle the data so that the doctor could have the option of superimposing graphs of fitness weight or sleep on top of the already existing prescription information while at the same time having the option of toggling the curves on and off to prevent the graph from always being cluttered our final product was a vast improvement over our initial one and we were happy with what we had learned deborah katherine and i went to lunch at cheeburger cheeburger and reflected upon the amazing opportunity we had been granted we all agreed that it had been a really fun and enlightening three days upon returning we made our final presentation to doug and then spent some time talking to him and ahmet about their role in the company and what they do this was very intriguing and i was able to gain a lot of valuable information as we asked questions and they answered the day ended with my fellow princeterns and i taking a picture together one that encompassed our time there eventually we parted way a bittersweet ending to a fantastic three days at past reflection  i am incredibly happy i was able to participate in this amazing princeternship i had a great time and learned a lot mr studholme’s lesson on entrepreneurship and startups was very interesting to me because i am interested in possibly starting my own business when i gradate moreover i loved talking to doug and ahmet about their roles and learning from them i came in with the intention of making this a learning experience and i think that i achieved my goal moreover i would not have gotten as much out of this princeternship had it not been for deborah and katherine they were amazing partners and were very responsible and friendly we were able to have some great conversations and have fun while being very productive it was a great team i am very grateful for the amazing opportunity granted to me i would like to thank career services and everyone involved for providing me with this opportunity and mr joe studholme and all at past inc for teaching me so much and making my stay such a wonderful and priceless experience pages welcome career services categories architecture  arts
