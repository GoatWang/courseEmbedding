forbes welcomeclose more options quote of the day only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly robert f kennedy politician nancy mckinstry back to main page what are they doing now   nancy mckinstry ceo wolters kluwer nancy mckinstry delivers transformative results the first female and the first nondutch ceo of wolters kluwer discusses what it took for a publishing giant to succeed in the digital age by jen swetzoff as a college student at the university of rhode island uri nancy mckinstry dreamed of becoming a foreign service officer but languages didn’t come as naturally to her as numbers did — and so she began focusing on business that move turned out to be good news for wolters kluwer the global information services company that mckinstry now leads named ceo in  when she was just  mckinstry has spent the past  years transforming what was predominantly a european publishing house into a global it solutions company today wolters kluwer operates in more than  countries providing information software tools and workflow solutions for professional customers in healthcare legal tax and financial services mckinstry has worked at the intersection of communications and technology for most of her career after graduating from uri with her ba in economics and political science she took a job with the new england telephone company in boston — at a time when the telecommunications industry was still regulated but starting to break up after two years of working primarily on pricing for new services she went to columbia university for her mba during her first summer of graduate school booz allen hamilton hired mckinstry for an internship given her experience in telecommunications an industry that was going through major changes at the time after school mckinstry continued working as a consultant in the media and telecommunications practices at booz allen hamilton after she had spent seven successful years there cch then one of the largest us legal and tax publishers hired mckinstry to develop its digital publishing strategy in  wolters kluwer acquired cch and mckinstry’s professional experiences and acumen were deemed particularly valuable to the company’s growth strategy she was repeatedly promoted until she left in  to work as the ceo of scp communications a medical information company a year later she returned to wolters kluwer to head its north american operations along with her husband mckinstry now lives in amsterdam their two children  and  after spending most of their childhood in the netherlands have returned to the united states for college and work during a recent visit to new york mckinstry talked with strategy about working abroad life without a car and what consulting taught her about running a company how has being based in the netherlands for the past  years changed your perspective i’ve learned to be a better listener — different cultures each have their own nuances and it’s important to understand what they are i’ve also learned that there’s lots of different ways to solve problems as long as you communicate where you want somebody to end up there’s a lot of latitude for how they get there  i believe that all young people who have the ambition to ultimately run a global business should take an expat assignment because the learning is so significant until you live outside your home country you don’t experience what it’s like to have to really adapt on the global stage what do you consider your greatest accomplishment being the ceo of a growing profitable business while having raised two children with my husband is something i certainly look back on with pride my husband’s been extremely supportive and i could not have had this level of success without him when i took over as ceo the company like most other media firms was going through a difficult period so we underwent a complete transformation that has touched almost every aspect of the company the people the capabilities how we’re structured how we resource things how we work together i think one of the most important decisions we made was to invest between  and  percent of our revenues back into new products and services since  we’ve stuck to that commitment even at the height of the recession or the financial crisis we cut costs in other areas but we continued to invest that was critical for the large innovative software solutions we’re building today it takes a while from the time you think of a product to build it to market it and to get penetration in the market during a transformation like yours what’s the leader’s role first you have to be sure of your vision commit to it and have a team around you that also believes it and is executing against it second you have to have the elevator pitch you have to be able to succinctly say here are the three priorities and why we’re doing this let’s go it can’t be a complicated message and finally you have to be able to change and pivot when things aren’t going well no plan is  percent executed the way you envision in the beginning  what are some of your biggest challenges i think that for all ceos in this day and age economic volatility is a significant challenge and it forces you to be nimble scenario planning has become an everyday discussion point for us which wasn’t the case  years ago and now we don’t do fiveyear plans we do threeyear plans which we’re constantly updating because of how quickly things change more specifically to our business one of the core challenges is how to best manage our legacy businesses while migrating into new technologies our customers use a broad range of solutions they still use some print resources and digital information but they also use newer workflow solutions our goal is to give them everything they need as you moved up in wolters kluwer what stuck with you from your consulting days consulting taught me three things that have proved absolutely invaluable in my career — problem solving teamwork and communication — all of which help you get to the most important goal delivering results there was a real rigor at booz allen hamilton around how do you work together to peel back a problem dissect it to find the solution and then clearly present it to the client i still consider myself a strong speaker and writer today because of my training as a consultant and i still remember something a partner said to me about communication skills you’ll never get a second chance to make a first impression at that time a longterm consulting project was maybe  weeks so you had a limited amount of time to make an impression on your team and the client it had better be a good one what’s a typical day like for you now the majority of my job is decision making at wolters kluwer one of the things that we pride ourselves on is the fact that we make decisions relatively quickly based on facts i travel roughly  percent of the time interacting with shareholders employees media and customers when i’m in the office i focus on meetings with other colleagues to discuss what’s going on with various business initiatives that we have under way can you share an example one of the things we’re excited about is the expansion of software solutions in our health division like uptodate a product that physicians rely on for clinical decision support it’s used in almost every patient encounter to figure out how to treat and diagnose a particular condition right now we’re developing and launching a chineselanguage version of uptodate we’re taking what’s worked successfully in other places and adapting it for the chinese market how would people closest to you describe you smart pragmatic and humble i hope they would also say i’m generous what do you consider your most marked characteristics i’m persistent and resilient which talent would you most like to have the ability to speak foreign languages every dutch person seems to speak at least three languages and i admire that what is your greatest extravagance and what is something you could live without i’m a big reader in our fastpaced world sitting down with a good book and reading just for pleasure is a definite extravagance for me as far as something i could live without i’d have to say my car now that our children are grown my husband and i just moved from a suburb of the hague into amsterdam we gave up our car and ride bikes instead who or what do you most admire individuals who have had major setbacks and come back from the experience stronger in interviews i often ask candidates to tell me about a setback they had what they learned and how they dealt with it what i’m looking for is whether they can dust themselves off and get back at it if they still have a positive attitude and can still be productive i admire that what do you think is the most overrated virtue patience in this day and age where there’s so much change whether it’s technological or global forces a little impatience can be healthy what advice would you give to people starting out in business above all else deliver results know how to solve problems build a team and communicate well but also be flexible and take risks particularly ones that give you global exposure when you listen to ceos’ stories you learn that few of them have taken a linear path it’s almost always a little bit of a zigzag jen swetzoff is a freelance writer and editor previously she worked with strategy as the deputy managing editor at strategybusiness magazine disclaimer please note that

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
