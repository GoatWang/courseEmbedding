athena global investors  investment management about our company how we invest investment strategies contact us overview team an investment firm driven by the pursuit of value athena global investors is an independent investment firm which employs a disciplined valueoriented approach to investing the firm manages portfolios for institutional clients athena global investors was formed in march  in the midst of one of the most challenging economic environments in modern history at that time virtually no asset class globally was spared from disappointment with investment returns turning negative on a year year year and even year annualized basis we founded athena with the idea that coming out of the crisis there would be enormous perhaps onceinalifetime investment opportunity despite controversy over the virtues of a buyandhold approach it has never been more appropriate to reaffirm and reapply the core principles of disciplined value investing with a long term view our investment process is based on the conviction that rigorous research and bottom up analysis conducted by experienced investment professionals in an open and collaborative setting yield positive outcomes in investment results by removing the obstacles of hierarchies and organizational complexities that afflict many larger firms we operate in an environment where ideas can flow freely our mission is to deliver superior riskadjusted investment returns to clients over the long term because we emphasize stockpicking not marketing the firm has limited the number of clients it serves adherence to a disciplined value investing strategy means that we focus on discrepancies between a companys intrinsic value and the discounted price of its securities investing in underappreciated companies and industries will be rewarded as securities prices eventually reflect intrinsic value athena global investors is based in reston virginia and was founded by karen a miller after  years as a portfolio manager and analyst with the capital group companies ms miller left in late  to pursue her dream of building a boutique investment management firm anchored firmly in the principles of value investing

investing about our company how we invest investment strategies contact us philosophy process ten principles guide our investment philosophy     we are value investors value investing is identifying companies which are priced at a significant discount to underlying business value we look for several elements when analyzing investment ideas i current earnings cash flow and returnsoncapital which are below normal and potential ii a low valuation relative to normal and potential iii a recovery trajectory that is realistic and likely iv transformative events either in industry structurecompetitiveness or management change which will improve a companys ability to earn above its cost of capital and v a margin of safety or downside protection provided by the balance sheet fixed assets intangibles or other factors     we have contrarian sensibilities a willingness to lean into the wind often delivers substantial reward relative to risk we work hard to understand both the conventional and unconventional point of view     rigorous fundamental research makes a difference our investment ideas are driven by rigorous fundamental research of companies we use financial analysis interviews with company management competitors customerssuppliers and regulators and proprietary surveys and quantitative data analysis as our key tools although we invest primarily in equities we analyze the debt and other parts of the capital structure to better inform our point of view     competitive advantage is achieved through better information and better judgment better information flows from exhaustive original leavenostoneunturned research and analysis better judgment is the result of cumulative investing experience that itself is often the product of mistakes made and lessons learned and successes kept in proper perspective     our investment horizon is longterm we are willing to ride out nearterm volatility when we believe our investors will be compensated with better returns in the longterm good investment ideas often require patience while it is seductive to take comfort in the certainty of the present we work hard to remain forwardlooking we want to skate to where the puck is going not to where it is     risk is defined not as beta or volatility but rather the likelihood of losing money we perform a liquidation analysis on all companies held in the portfolio to help us better understand and mitigate risk     dividends matter we favor capitalgenerative businesses and management that is appropriately balancing the needs for reinvestment with capital repatriation to shareholders we pay close attention to the overall dividend yield on the portfolio dividendpaying capacity and forecasted dividend growth and share repurchase potential     we do not overdiversify we believe holding a smaller number of stocks in the portfolio generally  companies is important to our investment philosophy of being focused on the highest conviction ideas while a focused approach may cause investment results to fluctuate more than that of a comparable diversified fund we believe long term results benefit     we believe in significant ownership in the funds we manage by investing sidebyside with other shareholders we remain singularly focused on the mission of producing superior investment results     valueinvesting does not work when investors broadly flee all risk as they did in  in the recent financial crisis many legendary value investors produced disappointing results reputations were tarnished and investment credibility questioned while funds managed by these professional value investors have subsequently recovered—some quite significantly—the experience left a dark cloud over an investment discipline which failed to protect investors from loss a key lesson learned is the importance of differentiating between a flawed investment approach and the consequences of extreme and pervasive risk aversion even if the latter occurs for understandable reasons value investing appears to fail as discrepancies between intrinsic value and current stock prices remain wide until structural appetite for investment risk returns during such times the tools of disciplined value investing are never more relevant yet ironically most likely to be abandoned they highlight opportunity to purchase good businesses run by good management at extraordinarily deep discounts to intrinsic value creating the potential for significant investment returns in the years ahead home  terms of use  client login  contact  freedom drive • suite  •
