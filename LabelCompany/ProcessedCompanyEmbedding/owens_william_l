pat buchanan  begin quote  to traditional christians god is the author of life and innocent life be it of the unborn or terminally ill may not be taken heroic means to keep the dying alive are not necessary but to advance a natural death by assisting a suicide or euthanasia is a violation of god’s commandment thou shalt not kill  and  in weimar germany two professors published “the permission to destroy life unworthy of life” which advocated assisted suicide for the terminally ill and “empty shells of human beings” hitler’s third reich marrying social darwinism to aryan racial supremacy carried the concepts to their logical if horrible conclusion  end quote  jr its hard to imagine government run healthcare with abortion and euthanasia but it will have it and we will be paying for it with our taxes personally will the church  its leadership and laity  have the stones to on the day it is passed to do two things  close all catholic hospitals ie shut them down and dont sell the facilities to the government just leave them idle and  call on all catholics and like minded souls to engage in civil disobedience the civil rights movement demonstrated how to do it do catholics have
