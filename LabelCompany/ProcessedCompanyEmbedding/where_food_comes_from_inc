packaging will impact what kind of verification and certification programs are available to you and most appropriate for your needs  as you can probably imagine programs that work well for a cattle producer or beef processor may not fit the needs of an asparagus farmer or orange juice purveyor  similarly the demand for specific product attributes varies greatly between commodities – which is exactly why you’ve come to the right place our team can help determine what programs may or may not fit best for your operation and your marketing needs and answer any questions you have on the process expectations standards and estimated audit schedule contact us today to learn more or search for some common programs by a specific area of focus below claims and programs we work with we offer thirdparty verification services to literally hundreds of claims programs and markets these include process verified programs safe quality food initiatives organic certification nongmo project

the usda has reviewed and approved we conduct the audits determine compliance to the claims requested and issue certificates of approval for our customers you can learn more about usda process verified programs here a few examples of these programs would be source verification – identification and traceability are the cornerstones of this claim to know an animal’s birthplace we must to be able to review records that identify the animal in a unique way tied to that source of origin this is most often done with the use of individual electronic ear tags that the animals wear which are then cross referenced to specific records maintained on the farm or ranch similarly source can be tracked in fruits vegetables grains and all types of agricultural products if you want the story behind your food you must first know where it came from that is why nearly  of our verification programs and services start with source verification as their base age verification – age verification of cattle remains a valuable and viable marketdriven program for the us beef industry not only does it prevent cattle from falling out of ev programs where dentition is the common means for age determination but coupled with source verification it is considered the base valueadd program for the cattle industry nonhormone treated cattle nhtc – the nhtc program was specifically developed in
