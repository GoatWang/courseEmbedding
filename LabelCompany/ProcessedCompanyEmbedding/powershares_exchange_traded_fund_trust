the index over longterm periods is a myth the potential for greater wealth as you can see an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment a comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five american funds over that same period illustrates our advantage those funds are amcap

american funds have two important traits when you compare mutual funds it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers it’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods characteristics of core funds that added value two screens can help sharpen your search source capital group based on morningstar® data narrowing your search the sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming we examined the large universe of equity funds in morningstar’s us and foreign largecap categories over a year period and looked for funds with two traits those within the lowest  of expenses and those

done even better than that significantly the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five and year periods a portfolio of largecap funds with lower expense ratios

advantage select funds can reduce risk index funds fall as far as the market they track but investors don’t have to over time they can gain more by losing less august  share gain by losing less there are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market losing less – the socalled lowdownside capture approach – holds appeal for investors especially considering that  of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to  of market downturns  downside capture a fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness for example if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only  as far as the market its downside capture ratio is  if it fell  more than the market its downside capture ratio is   see how american funds delivered indexbeating returns by losing less a closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our us stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times  why it matters consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for longterm investors funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride making it easier for those with longterm objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets the arithmetic of loss the ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss consider the following if a  investment loses  its value drops to  in order for the investment to return to the  level that  must do more than gain  which would only bring it to  it needs to double digging out of a hole is never easy but the shallower the hole the shorter the climb better positioned by losing less the farther an investment falls the longer the path back to break even some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound to mitigate risk seek funds that have held up better during declines looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness when we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has on average delivered indexbeating results finding funds that can mitigate risk within the universe of large cap us funds screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that on average outpaced its peers as well as the sp  index further narrowing the lowdownside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further the chart shown here is based on data for rolling fiveyear periods for the  years ended december   see methodology investments are not fdicinsured nor

indepth tools and analysis smart beta research for advisors visit the powershares smart beta research center for indepth tools and analysis overview smart beta funds resources overview employing features of both worlds smart beta strategies seek to offer investors an alternative to the traditionally polarized passive and active portfolio construction options they are not simply offshoots of active management or etf replication vehicles through smart beta etf strategies we believe investors have the opportunity to retain broad market exposure potentially achieve longterm outperformance when compared to an index and reduce portfolio risk in a liquid transparent and low cost way a pioneer in smart beta etf strategies powershares believes that smart beta strategies offer exposure to the best of both worlds providing investors a valuable alternative that expands portfolio construction opportunities we were founded on the belief that all investors should be provided with a smarter way to access the markets  beyond traditional active and passive strategies powershares introduced many of the first smart beta vehicles available today calling them intelligent etfs there is no assurance that an investment strategy will outperform or achieve its investment objectives  liquidity shares are not individually redeemable and owners of the shares may acquire those shares from the fund and tender those shares for redemption to the fund in creation unit aggregations only typically consisting of    or  shares transparency etfs disclose their holdings daily low cost since ordinary brokerage commissions apply for each buy and sell transaction frequent activity may increase the cost of etfs smart beta funds may underperform capweighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk  when we say that our etfs are intelligent we mean that in several different ways please see important information below for a more detailed explanation powershares smart beta etf strategies as a pioneer in

report  smart beta correlation and factor chart brochure  the invesco white paper series on the activepassive debate glossary  terms beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements for example a beta of one means that the security is expected to move with the market a beta of less than one means the security is expected to be less volatile than the overall market betas greater than one are expected to exhibit more volatility or movement than the general market factor driven a method of using objective style determinates such as book value cash flow sales and dividends within an index in attempt to achieve mutually exclusive security selection front month roll is a process in which an index automatically rolls to the next available futures contract with a predetermined expiration month eg the nexttoexpire contract liquidity liquidity is characterized by a high level of trading activity and is a measure of the degree to which an asset or stock can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its asset price assets or stocks that can be easily bought or sold are known as liquid assets low cost since ordinary brokerage commissions apply for each buy and sell transaction frequent activity may increase the cost of etfs marketcapweighted a type of index in which individual components are weighted according to market capitalization index value can be calculated by adding the market capitalizations of each index component and dividing that sum by the number of securities in the index optimum yield™ a roll methodology that is specially designed for investors to gain access to the commodities market the way many institutions or commodity professionals would  rather than employing a front month roll methodology smart beta an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk or both transparency etfs disclose their holdings daily important information when we say that our etfs are intelligent we mean that in several different ways one of our largest family of etfs is based on intellidexes™  dynamic indexes that use rulesbased quantitative analysis to choose stocks for their capital appreciation potential we believe this is an intelligent way for an index to select stocks our etfs based on ftse rafi® indexes weight stocks according to fundamental economic factors we believe this is a more intelligent weighting method than marketcap weighting furthermore our fundamental index etfs are based on four factors  sales cash flow book value and dividends  which we believe is a more balanced intelligent approach than weighting stocks according to just one fundamental measure we also have a wide range of etfs that target narrow slices of the market intelligent access  from niche industries to specific world regions for investors who are interested in these niches we believe etfs  which invest in multiple companies within a market sector  may offer a more intelligent investment approach than stock picking our powershares db commodity funds intelligent access provide systematic access to some of the worlds most important commodities by seeking to replicate rulesbased indexes composed of futures contracts that trade on some of the most liquid and deep commodity markets in the world overall no matter what the focus all etfs offer investors tax efficiency and trading flexibility which make them an intelligent investment tool for investors to consider whether youre looking for broad market exposure specialized investment strategies or access to niche markets we believe powershares etfs represent an intelligent option for your portfolio general risk information investments focused in a particular industry are subject to greater risk and are more greatly impacted by market volatility than more diversified investments there are risks involved with investing in etfs including possible loss of

american funds have two important traits when you compare mutual funds it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers it’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods characteristics of core funds that added value two screens can help sharpen your search source capital group based on morningstar® data narrowing your search the sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming we examined the large universe of equity funds in morningstar’s us and foreign largecap categories over a year period and looked for funds with two traits those within the lowest  of expenses and those within the highest  in manager ownership we found that the funds with both characteristics highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors look for funds that meet two key criteria largecap equity funds with low expense ratios and high manager ownership source capital group based on morningstar data boosting success rates as shown in the chart below not all funds are equal most in fact rarely outpace the index however funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers and funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that significantly the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five and year periods a portfolio of largecap funds with lower expense ratios

advantage select funds can reduce risk index funds fall as far as the market they track but investors don’t have to over time they can gain more by losing less august  share gain by losing less there are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market losing less – the socalled lowdownside capture approach – holds appeal for investors especially considering that  of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to  of market downturns  downside capture a fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness for example if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only  as far as the market its downside capture ratio is  if it fell  more than the market its downside capture ratio is   see how american funds delivered indexbeating returns by losing less a closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our us stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times  why it matters consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for longterm investors funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride making it easier for those with longterm objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets the arithmetic of loss the ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss consider the following if a  investment loses  its value drops to  in order for the investment to return to the  level that  must do more than gain  which would only bring it to  it needs to double digging out of a hole is never easy but the shallower the hole the shorter the climb better positioned by losing less the farther an investment falls the longer the path back to break even some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound to mitigate risk seek funds that have held up better during declines looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness when we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has on average delivered indexbeating results finding funds that can mitigate risk within the universe of large cap us funds screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that on average outpaced its peers as well as the sp  index further narrowing the lowdownside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further the chart shown here is based on data for rolling fiveyear periods for the  years ended december   see methodology investments are not fdicinsured nor
