no description by jake floro on  january  tweetcomments  please log in to add your comment report abusetranscript of bauer hockeybauer hockeybauers codesbautosic code naics code social responsibilities bauer is the clearcut leader in the hockey equipment industry like any other big company they must maintain a good reputation and do so by improving their image to the public they do little things like fundraisers and donations to keep their image and remain a leader in the industry for example bauer donated equipment to youth hockey programs in philadelphia and boston the marketing strategy behind this shows that they care about the game of hockey and are trying to get more kids to have the opportunity to play although it is seen by the public as a generous donation bauer really does this to get the support of future customers who think bauer really cares about the community another example of this is how bauer is campaigning to expand hockey in canada over the next  years president of bauer hockey kevin davis quotes as the industry leader we feel it is our responsibility to invest the resources necessary to help propel our game to new levels he claims that bauer sincerely wants to grow the game of hockey so everyone has the chance to play the great sport however bauer’s “social responsibility” is really driven by potential customers and keeping a good public image rather than pure generosityboard of directors management teambauers management team consists of two chief officers and six vice presidents of specific operations such as human resources
