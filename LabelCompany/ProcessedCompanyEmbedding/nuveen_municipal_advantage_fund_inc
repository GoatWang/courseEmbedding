counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposessingle state

there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful  derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount investedmunicipal bond market liquidity risk inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years either due to brokerdealer choices or to federal banking regulations reducing their ability to make a market in these securities this may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs particularly during periods of economic or market stress as a result the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired to sell other securities to raise cash or to give up
