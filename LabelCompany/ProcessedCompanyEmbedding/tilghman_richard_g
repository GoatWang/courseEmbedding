washingtonpostcom interview with richard g tilghman ceo of crestar part i interview with richard g tilghman go to main story go to the edited transcript of the interview part i part ii ceo of crestar financial corp richard g tilghman chairman and chief executive of crestar financial corp recently sat down to talk with washington post editors and reporters about the regions economy the changing nature of banking and his company which is now the regions largest bank by market share with him were peter f nostrand president of crestars washingtonarea operations and james m wells the companys president an edited transcript of that conversation follows unless otherwise noted tilghman is giving the answers q maybe i could ask you to start just by talking a little about where crestar is where you want to be and obviously with particular reference to your plans for our region a and if i may please call me richard i dont come from a very formal culture and i dont think of myself as being very old although my children do so if thats okay with you i would answer better to it a few words about the bank to maybe set the stage in  when the interstate banking laws were passed we said then that we thought it would take a decade to sort out the marketplace that was then frequently referred to as the golden crescent and you may remember in those days people were talking about the wonderful demography of baltimore to washington to richmond all the way around to hampton roads which formed sort of a crescent shape and we set upon a path of being an important bank in that market and as i will argue in a minute we have substantially accomplished that goal but with more to do the theory then and it remains an accurate one for us today is that demographically virginia is at the bottom of the economic north as opposed to at the top of the cultural south thats not the sort of thing i normally say in richmond but the facts are that if you look at our population you look at business and trade and where traffic goes and all that sort of stuff theres an immense amount of flow back and forth in this region you have the bonding of the chesapeake bay with maryland you have the transportation network a lot of things sort of suggest to us that economically we needed to focus our attention to the north as opposed to the south which is why youve seen us do no acquisitions essentially south of virginia while youre seen all of our interest go really to virginia and north and our goal is quite simple this is an enormous marketplace if you put it all together the washingtonbaltimore market is the fourth or fifth largest consumer market in america depending on how you keep the score and you all know these numbers far better than we in  as we could see this interstate banking stuff coming we were a bank that really put not a terrible amount of energy even into northern virginia  northern virginia being for people in richmond sort of up there and they really didnt understand it very well and we moved a fine man named bill harris up here in  to sort of figure out how to put us on the map and it was really no more sophisticated a charge than that we said bill go up there and figure out how to make us an important bank in this washington area starting with northern virginia because we couldnt come into the district but to make us important that process was substantially aided when interstate banking was passed and we bought the nst bank which is now the physical headquarters which we operate we bought a bank in maryland almost simultaneously called the bank of bethesda which put us into montgomery county and all of a sudden boom we were a threestate bank so to speak with three different names and we were united virginia in virginia nst in the district bank of bethesda so we changed our name to crestar bank we launched a major effort recognizing that this is a very consumeroriented marketplace to enhance our service quality and to make us a bank that was as appealing to consumers as we were to businesses in virginia we had sort of a reputation of being the bank of business q how did you come up with the name crestar a we hired not one but two namechange consultants who are a common commodity we were in a hurry they are people who will study this for one interestingly enough they both came up with the same name it was on a short list for both namechange people and it was that golden crescent idea they just picked up on the golden crescent we wanted seven letters instead of six because that was the era of signet and sovran and remember all those so what they do is they come up with hundreds of names and we winnow them down and then you carry around cards in your pocket and then you pitch yourself off the edge of a cliff and pick one a cynic would also suggest that maybe these days you all have the same computer programs theres a finite number of words in the world interestingly enough in those days we operated in  states with our mortgage company and we were doing business in five or six in various ways so youve got copyright laws trademark laws to deal with everywhere which drives you to a madeup name so you dont have to spend days in litigation trying to get the right title to a name you want to use so thats why you see signet and sovran and crestar all these manufactured names q and you cant mispronounce it thats the other thing a im confident that was not part of our scheme in those days so with all of that becoming important here became really a crucial challenge for us and led ultimately to a string of acquisitions in this market which really began in a big way with perpetual savings bank which was purchased with the rtc and has been associated with a number of other smaller acquisitions and most importantly recently with the affiliation with citizens bank of laurel maryland which if you think about us from a market share standpoint we were very strong in virginia kind of about right in the district of columbia and weakest in maryland and we really werent in prince georges county which was a very fastgrowing county in maryland q why didnt you go into prince georges county before then a we just couldnt get there there was no  that was big enough to really solve the problem for us the biggest i guess bank in that market was one called suburban which sovran bank bought back in the dark ages and then it was just a lot of small community banks and one thing we really didnt want to do was start a de novo branch terribly expensive too many banks we did some acquisitions but really not much in prince georges at all until citizens came along citizens is strongest in prince georges and next strongest in montgomery and we were strongest in montgomery and not strong along in prince georges well you put the two of us together and it filled the gap or the hole in the doughnut for us filled the missing piece of the ring in the doughnut and has been a spectacular thing from our point of view because its a very fine bank and brought us to our present position which is we are the nd were roughly  billion in size depending on whos keeping score were somewhere around th or th largest bank in the us we claim market share and leadership in the washington metropolitan area were the largest bank holding company thats headquartered in virginia and we want to be a bank that focuses on the delivery of financial services on this marketplace defining this marketplace as virginia washington and its environs and maryland  and thats our goal and objective simply put by 999 to have most people recognize us as being the best bank around the leading financial services institution is a strategic goal of ours and that would entail having leadership and market share leadership in satisfying our customers financial leadership in terms of excellence and performance and in turn have that translate into excellent returns for our shareholders q does that mean that youre not satisfied with the onepercentagepoint advantage you have over nationsbank a first place is first place we would clearly like that margin to be wider market share is a complicated subject and it had to be coupled with profitability you cant just have market share without profits and we have real goals in those regards we want to be a market share leader but we also want to have the majority of the people households we do business with to be significant and profitable as well and in the context of that if we can achieve both of those goals we think well perform quite well market share is tough to grow but not impossible to grow and we have a dual strategy of both getting more business and were still very interested in merger and acquisitions and have been an aggressive acquirer of both thrifts and banks from an assets standpoint and we would continue that we dont see that coming to an end but were also if it doesnt make sense for the institution to combine with us were not pushy about it we dont want to do something thats not in both partys interest because in the long run happy customers are what you want to end up with and if theyre not happy about the way the two organizations came together then youre going to have an unsatisfactory experience q how do you compete when on rates you can be undercut by smaller banks or mortgage brokers or whatever so given the marketplace and half a chance a consumers going to take a lower rate so how do you deal with that a complicated question ill come back to the question of market shares there are hundreds of things that motivate consumers buying decisions and it is a very very competitive market as you all know just from living here with lots of choices ranging all the way from small banks to large financial institutions the thing that were aiming to do is to have the best bundle of convenient delivery alternatives for the purchase of financial services and competitive prices but not necessarily leading edge the individual who is interested in getting absolutely the best rate or absolutely the lowest rate or absolutely the highest deposit rate will always be able to find someone in the marketplace whos going to be offering a better rate than we are but what were intending to do is to give the individual whos interested in a decent rate a good rate an outstanding combination of convenient delivery alternatives ranging all the way from being able to bank by telephone to being able to do banking through traditional banks to being able to do banking through all kinds of alternative electronic delivery mechanisms so we can get with crestar on your personal computer you can get with crestar by telephone you can get with crestar in a bank physically you can use our atms you can use our interactive marketing terminals and our theory quite simply is that for most people a fair price and convenience is going to be a powerful motivator now there will be plenty of people for whom other things will be powerful motivators but we dont need to get  percent of the market we just want to get more than our fair share theres no reason to believe that banks of our size cannot offer financial instruments that are competitive in price with large institutions theres no reason we cant from a cost structure standpoint where the economies and scale available in institutions our size are almost the economies available in extremely large institutions in some areas we would argue that those economies that they may have are offset by bureaucratic differences we presumably are going to be closer to the customer and nimbler in our response we also have sort of a different organizational strategy than a lot of institutions as peter nostrand who is to my left here is the president of our banking operations in the greater washington region  and i would dare say that most of you have absolutely no clue as to who i was before we came here and thats a strategy thats by design we operate in a lot of markets where our theory of life is that people want to conduct banking with local operations and yet were not local i mean its very obvious weve only got one headquarters so our answer to that is we have a string of regional headquarters where we have a regional president to whom reports both retail banking and commercial banking and the credit decisions that are made in that marketplace charitable contributions no one need ever come to richmond virginia to raise money in the washington metropolitan area all they need to do is go see peter conversely no ones going to be successful if their idea doesnt work for peter then it doesnt work for crestar the advantage of this that our experience is that people in any given community like to think that their banking services are being provided in that community we do like everybody else we have call centers we have as much efficient processing as we could possibly get our hands on in the back office but we want to be sure that for consumers and businesses the local people that they can turn to who understand the market who believe in the marketplace and who can participate in making that decision and we think thats a strategy that will over a long period of time separate us out from the people who are providing global banking services at the other end of the telephone if you want to call us up at  in the morning well you can do that but on the other hand if you walk down the street and see somebody in a branch you can do that too and if you want to talk to the president of the bank you can get to peter nostrand you dont have to go to somebody who works in virginia q perhaps we could put peter on the spot and ask him about what do you see as the key strengths and weaknesses in the district suburban maryland and northern virginia and particularly whether you feel any more encouraged about the districts economy a peter nostrand turn to the local economy  i think washington initiative is the new phrase now  and they go out and they market washington and they say right place right time one could argue i think thats the way the washington region our region has some attributes that are fairly unique in the united states this is a washington marketplace and i think it grew to be a reflection if you look at it and i look at it just from a commercial perspective it has to do with employment and revenues and dollars the market is unique first of all health care insurance it is growing as we all know that is one of the fastest growing  the greater washington has some  hospitals of a national stature and a growing assistedlivingcare industry in this region and if you look at the demography you understand why it really should do well secondly its known and ive seen a lot of reports written about the average education here and the household income and theyre both very very high but what is not recognized too often is that theres a big education business in the greater washington region there are some  nationally recognized universities eight colleges my daughters going to be going to one this fall so this is a big business for education third and i probably should have started with the federal government the federal presence is obviously one that leads to a great deal of stability in income  and despite the cutbacks the federal presence is a huge presence here the notforprofit industry is a big big business in the greater washington region and certainly one of the big attractions for us at crestar the notforprofit industry i think employs i think it ranks no  in the number of people it employs and with the not for profits youve got trade associations that are very very big here in the district of columbia i think  percent of all the trade associations are here in the greater washington region youve got  multinational unions that are headquartered here thats over  percent of the unions so from an employment perspective the not for profits are a great big deal in the district fifth youve got the international side there are four hundred or so us subsidiaries of foreign companies here in this region and thats another fast growing segment sixth youve got tourism which is the third largest employer in the region and the technology center the greater washington board of trade put a study out recently that shows that there are  technology firms in the region all the big names are here one of the most interesting aspects of that is some  percent of these high tech firms here employ less than  people thats a tremendous amount of energy and vitality and creativity in the marketplace which is a good sign for this region so in answer to your question about the economy in the greater washington region i think the first thing you have to say it has  unique i think in cities in this country  is the fact that technology and not for profit and the federal government and tourism these are things that increase and decrease and with the economy that there are things that are very stable things i think when you talk about what the economy is like today you have to separate it into northern virginia suburban maryland and the district the figures ive seen recently suggest that northern virginia is doing better than the us as a whole whereas suburban maryland is about on par and the district unfortunately has some say has been in a recession since 99 in large measure because of the cutbacks in the federal government we used to see in the 9s and 9s when i first came up here in the 9s youd see job growth and  jobs here now its down to about  jobs and the whole economy with just that slower pace of growth one of the interesting things that one of our economists at the bank mentioned to me yesterday that i think would he of interest to you all it certainly is to us is that with this computer  that in fact the federal government has got the same issue that a lot of the private sector does and weve read statistics about what it would cost to fix that and i think that omb said it would cost  billion for the federal government to bring all of the special hardware and computers to bring it up to compliance with the year  issues the private industry people have used a number as high as  billion while there seems to be emerging consensus around a  billion dollar number if you translate that back into jobs for this region for this economy it could mean that the federal governments share of that  billion is proportionately the same as it has been in the past which means that roughly  billion are spent here you could see as many as  new jobs created in 9 and 999 to help address this 9 requirement that could lead people to sort of think that the economic issues and the employment issues in the district and the region would be solved so you have to be careful q a lot of retired ones coming out when you look kind of more closely at the kind of detail that you see about the projects and the mortgages do you see the districts economy going this way or this way whats the long term a the encouraging thing about the district is that there are so many parties now that should be privy to the discussion are parties to the discussion the white house is a party to it the congress is at the table the local politicians are there local business groups are there its the first time in my memory that you have the right people at the table and because of that i dont see how i can see how things would have to get better from here q a business measure thats what im groping for here are things looking up down or sideways a we look at the market in so many different ways talking about the greater washington region is like talking about my fellow americans in that respect there is no really my fellow americans nor is there a gwr person people who work in the district may live outside the district and people who live in the district may work in northern virginia and suburban maryland it really depends on how you cut it if youre talking about the district government per se i think in the long term we are still big believers in this marketplace  i think there will be some assistance in terms of the congress and the white house i think their doors are reasonably open on that and it could have a very good impact on the district q peter youre not seeing any fundamental difference are you in the way deposits are growing in district branches versus  a nostrand no not at all q how deposits might be growing in the district versus how they grow in maryland or  a nostrand how is it possible to tell to the point for example i bank on new york avenue in the district i live in alexandria my deposits are likely to be counted as part of the districts versus northern virginia and theres such fluidity in the region now that its very hard to distinguish one area from another q part of what i think were curious about is whether the interdependence you know this golden crescent concept that launches you on your path of growth saw northern virginia tied to the district tied to maryland whether youre seeing communications as we are that that may not be holding up that in fact northern virginia is you know in a really extraordinary cycle now of job growth new business grow ancillary supporting business and at the same time the district and maryland are basically standing still and that northern virginia is accelerating into some new space and i guess im wondering does that require some alterations in your strategic plan is there going to be less interdependence in this region than you might once have thought because of the surprisingly vast growth of northern virginia and what do you do about that as a business youre profiting from that a nostrand well regardless of where the growth is we want to be part of it and if the growth is in northern virginia we certainly want to be a part of that growth and a lot of the growth in northern virginia is in the technology sector you see the growth in northern virginia and an attempt by northern virginia to push itself as the next silicon valley in fact and it could well be if you have this world congress and information technology that northern virginia is assuming that role but certainly the economic health of the entire region at large which we have a key interest in you know there are certain interregional issues which you really cant escape and transportation is certainly a big one water and sewage treatment is a big one prisons and there are lots of very fundamental societal regional issues which require cooperation q richard let me ask you is there time to do some fine tuning in the strategic sense a well from our standpoint we have significant market share in northern virginia and i guess the thing i would grapple for is to draw a distinction between the business opportunities that may be presenting themselves and the consumer banking opportunities because what we see is that people tend to move around the washington metropolitan area relatively freely and an individual might live in loudoun county work downtown in the district and shop in maryland on the weekend and as a strategy for consumers we want to be essentially well located in all of those markets so an individual can bank where they work where they shop where they live from a business development standpoint when peter first moved up here he did some similar work that identified i think some  different clusters peter if my memory serves where there are nodes or concentrations of business opportunities across all the geographies and you really attack those kinds of business problems quite differently commercial lending officers are frequently not resident in a branch but rather are in office buildings or more likely even still in an automobile en route to call on a customer at their place of doing business and most typically theyll be specialized by some sort of skill the not for profit specialized in dealing with not for profits or government contractors is a specialization group for us or technology or whatever the market concentration might be so if you will if its beginning to boom in high tech in northern virginia then its not difficult for us to ship resources to that market and you know virginia is quite strong right now a combination i think of felicitous public policy and the work done by predecessor organizations to build a favorable business environment for high technology and the guys who started the internet back in well i guess it was the 9s happened to be in northern virginia and we probably all owe them a debt of gratitude for starting that seminal high tech business and defense clearly led to a lot of this as well q im happy to hear you say that explain that to some of my colleagues a yeah i mean i think its like somebody said to me one time the way to have a great franchise is to have had a great franchise well you know i think virginia is a state that for whatever lucky reasons had the infrastructure begin to be built there years and years ago my sense is maryland and i know maryland less well so this may be unfair but my sense is that maryland went more in the direction of medicine with the national institute of health and johns hopkins more heavy manufacturing and biotechnology q and weapons systems a and as a result as those sort of technologies have ebbed and flowed from contributing to the growth engine you see a difference in the way virginias performing versus maryland but there was a time when the reverse was probably true almost inevitably and our optimism was very clear this is a marketplace thats got the nations capital as the centerpiece i mean there dont happen to be other markets in the united states that can lay that claim and theres always going to be i think an extraordinary critical mass of very very talented people coupled with government here coupled with arguably a wonderful place for facilities here the quaity of life despite all the social problems im tremendously optimistic q the strong conclusion that the rivers getting wider and wider and northern virginias breaking away from the washington metropolitan area and the person who lives in loudoun county and works in the district of columbia and shops in maryland never gets into maryland never gets in the district of columbia in fact if that person gets that far in and shops at fair oaks and i wonder if some of that is in your  and i dont know whether this is true or not but you can see the economy going in different directions a well these  places peter noticed whenever it was  or  years ago there are now probably  of them pick reston or columbia or wherever you used to pick people live and work in the same place if they can do that so that is clearly the case however the dynamic of the whole area absolutely matters i mean we see it in virginia all the time if you look at the older cities and you talk about the donuts and the holes and all those sorts of things and they are inextricably intertwined in our opinion and you have to worry about the whole area at the same time you focus on these nodes and thats sort of the way we think about it whether its baltimore or richmond or roanoke or wherever it is we see exactly that in richmond twenty years ago the commuting pattern in richmond which weve done some studies on was almost entirely in and out it was all basically a matter i guess it would be west to east in the morning and then east to west in the evening and now its multidirectional its north to south south to north west to east people going in all kinds of different directions but nonetheless it reinforces in a way almost the need to be omnipresent from a banking facility and from a service standpoint the other point i want to make here and its sort of crucial to this business of market share is that we are very much an industry that is ever segmenting people and businesses by estimations of what it is they need and want to buy and how they need and want to buy it so increasingly you dont see us or other banks looking at a market like greater washington in a monolithic way but rather trying to understand the thousands of little submarkets that make up this big market so that we can have products and services that will work for ever smaller clusters and are ever more precisely designed and delivered but we can do this because increasingly we have the data processing chip that only peter really understands how we make money where we make money and couple that with marketing tools that marry that up with demography which is not necessarily a good predictor of banking success and with if you will lifestyle buying patterns so that we are not trying to sell home mortgages to people who are  years old because were blanketing a given market with mortgages today but rather were really zeroing in based on values and on behavioral characteristics that would lead us to believe that that party might be interested in a mortgage so you know we can if you will in one way afford to look at a given marketplace as a unit and yet in another way the obligation is almost immediately that we begin to define that unit in ever and ever smaller chunks so that were really giving people what they want and customer knowledge data bases are i guess a common point of conversation in lots of industries today and theyre made possible by the fact that that storage has become inexpensive enough to keep enormous files q thats an interesting topic would you ever let us sit with you and see how that ends up working as a business tool a sure im not sure wed be willing to do it tomorrow in all seriousness and the reason im reticent about the time and speed is because the progress that we and everybody else has made in this sort of stuff is still were still learning how to use these systems but sure q do you agree with the way nationsbank has taken theyve been taking a lot of heat about their new customer service and ranking people by profitability and delivering services based on that and thats part of this whole data mining awell it is and it isnt it is an answer it is one of a huge possible universe of answers to data mining it surely is a manifestation of the sort of things that people do with data mining but its not necessarily an approach that you know would be appropriate for us or any other financial institution what it is indicative of is that were all beginning to use information and come up with individualized responses to what that information says when you think about it  years ago we were a regulated industry selling standard products to standard people in a standard way i mean we were one size fit all and if it didnt work for you tough darts but now were really beginning to customize products for businesses and consumers in very very individualized ways interview continued part ii copy copyright 997 the washington post back to the top richard tilghman  us army
