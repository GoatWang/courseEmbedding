marta stewart chief financial officer turning now to slide  were pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results as weve continued to drive both resource utilization and growth marking our sixth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear operating ratio improvements and an alltime record we decreased our second quarter operating ratio by  basis points to  income from operations of  million was up  compared to the prioryear period earnings per share increased  to  we continue to successfully execute our multidimensional strategy and achieved another record operating ratio of  million for the first half of the year a  basis point improvement from last years record income from operations was up  to  billion and earnings per share increased  to  also a first half record these results demonstrate that our strategic plan built upon our core pillars of safety service stewardship and growth is working as intended providing a reliable framework that our team has successfully executed upon to propel improved operational efficiencies which will deliver over  million productivity savings this year the determination and perseverance of our employees to affect sustainable change has been instrumental in our achievements importantly their work has also established a strong foundation for ongoing growth and success as reflected on slide  since the inception of our strategic plan we have commenced a broad set of initiatives including reducing ga and consolidating headquarters restructuring triple crown and pocahontas land subsidiaries rationalizing over  miles of track including the short lining of our west virginia secondary and delmarva south lines idling our ashtabula docks coal terminal and restructuring yards including the idling of knoxville sevier yard and chattanooga hump operations and consolidating operating regions and divisions including the recently announced consolidation of our central division in addition to these initiatives we have rationalized and revitalized our locomotive fleet achieving our highest quarterly locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency on record productivity initiatives targeting freight car utilization are ongoing as well through our dynamic plan we are continuing to aggressively pursue additional opportunities for improvement mike will provide you with an update on our ongoing initiatives and metrics later on the call moving to slide  with respect to our market approach we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver quality service that our customers value and growth that complements our network alan will provide additional details on some of our ongoing initiatives which include partnering with customers to develop unique key performance indicators implementing projects that enhance both the customers experience and improve our efficiencies and leveraging the strength of our industrial development team to feed our pipeline for future growth as a result of our initiatives and as you can see on the right of this slide weve increased volumes by  while reducing average head count  versus last years levels and  compared to  our strategy has supported the return of capital to shareholders through increase in dividend payments and share buybacks as reflected on slide  cumulative distributions have totaled  billion since the inception of our share repurchase program in  dividends per share have increased by  compound annual growth rate over that period in addition weve repurchased nearly  million shares at an average cost of about  a share as we look forward given the strong financial results weve achieved todate and the confidence we have in outlook were increasing this years share repurchase guidance by  to  billion turning now to our longerterm guidance on slide  we continue to make solid progress toward achieving a sub operating ratio which im confident well accomplish by  or sooner i have consistently said that our plan is dynamic and flexible and as we reach these targets were committed to driving performance improvement whether through improved productivity or growth or both i have every confidence in our ability to achieve and surpass our objectives and create sustainable value in both the short and long term and ill now turn the program over to alan shaw chief marketing officer alan alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp thank you jim and good morning everyone our second quarter was marked by strong yearoveryear volume improvement in intermodal and coal generating total revenue of  billion up  versus  intermodal reached a record quarterly volume with a yearoveryear increase of  units benefiting from continued highway conversions and new service offerings utility coal increased  shipments in the second quarter as a result of a previously reported market share gain and higher yearoveryear natural gas prices export coal grew  units due to improved seaborne pricing which made us coals more competitive in the international market positive pricing was partially offset by mix improving our revenue per unit in all seven groups and  in total overall our merchandise volume was flat in the second quarter as gains in frac sand and steel were offset by declines in crude oil growth in the metals and construction segment was driven by increases in shipments of frac sand due to increased drilling activity in the marcellus and utica shale regions additionally improvements in steel pricing change in supply chains and inventory replenishment led to higher volumes in our steel franchise these gains were partially offset by the clients in our crude oil volume which has been negatively impacted by pipeline activity automotive volume declined due to decreases in us vehicle production while paper was impacted by strong truck competition merchandized revenue increased  versus second quarter  to  billion with a corresponding  increase in revenue per unit positive pricing was impacted by mix shifts as well as excess truck capacity on slide  intermodal revenue increased  to  million as volume increased  to over  million units domestic volume grew in the second quarter due to continued highway conversions and collaboration with our channel partners to develop new markets these gains were partially offset by headwinds due to elevated truck capacity our alignment with shipping partners growing at east coast ports led to  growth in our international volume revenue per unit was up  intermodal pricing continues to be impacted by excess truck capacity a condition we expect to improve as the year progresses tightening capacity is expected to drive stronger pricing growth in  moving to slide  our coal revenue grew an impressive  versus the same period last year to  million volume increased  and revenue per unit improved  compared to second quarter  increased utility coal volume resulted from the previously discussed market share gain coupled with favorable natural gas prices compared to prioryear levels growth in this segment was also driven by increased export volume as tightening international supply improved seaborne pricing yearoveryear revenue per unit increased  positive pricing particularly in our export market was partially offset by increased shorthaul utility north volume and mix shifts within the export market similar to what we saw on the first quarter moving to slide  we expect yearoveryear growth in the third quarter led by intermodal and coal with low to midsingledigit decline in our merchandise volume comparisons to last year become more difficult as overall volumes began to accelerate sequentially in the third quarter of  merchandise volume is expected to be negatively impacted by continued diversions of crude oil and natural gas liquids to pipelines steel shipments are expected to decline sequentially as customer inventories were replenished in the first half of this year moreover a projected annual  decrease in us vehicle production will negatively impact automotive volume in the second half with the largest yearoveryear decrease in the third quarter partially offsetting these declines we project continued growth in frac sand due to increased natural gas production although the yearoveryear growth will be less than what we experienced in the second quarter we are generating opportunities as our customer supply chains adapt to the rapidly evolving ecommerce and consumer markets our marketing and operations teams are collaborating together with our customers to align their growth with ours through new strategic services that capitalize on these quicklychanging market trends our intermodal franchise benefited from these new services in the second quarter which will provide ongoing growth for years to come we are also prepared for growth as the truck market continues to tighten driving highway to rail conversions strong service products that focus on the needs of our customers as well as efficient operations provide confidence that our growing intermodal franchise will continue to enhance shareholder value while we project the yearoveryear improvement in the coal market in the second half the pace of this growth will lessen due to a sequential decline in export coal and higher utility volume in the second half of last year export tonnage will likely moderate from first half levels to the  million to  million ton per quarter range with volume contingent on sustained seaborne price levels in line with our projections last quarter we anticipate third quarter utility tonnage between  million and  million tons with the fourth quarter tonnage contingent on some of our stockpile levels and natural gas prices our bestinclass industrial development team consistently works with potential new customers strengthening our position in the supply chain our list of active projects remains robust and will provide continued growth opportunities that will benefit futureyear volumes further underscoring the sustainability of our plan our strategic plan maintains a focus on the customer experience part of this focus includes working with our customers to align our service metrics with our customers view of our performance as well as partnering to ensure we provide effective tools to schedule and manage their business with norfolk southern our aim is to continually evolve the elements of our operations that drive quality growth and efficiency this approach increases our value to customers and strengthens our position in the marketplace for the near and long term as our customers are innovating to serve a dynamic changing world we are doing the same working together to design efficient supply chain solutions for their emerging needs for example we recently repurposed a triple crown yard to provide innovative solutions for the gas market we further enhanced this service by combining aspects of unit train operations with the demand for singlecar shipments customers value these types of innovative solutions driven by the continuity and our longstanding customer relationships market knowledge and seamless marketing and operating philosophy with our strong partnerships throughout the supply chain well continue to enhance our ability to serve our customers while generating strong returns for our shareholders i will now turn it over to mike who will discuss our operational performance michael j wheeler  norfolk southern corp thank you alan and good morning in the second quarter we continued to grow our business and provide a good service product to our customers we also achieved our strong results while streamlining our operations and idling our largest hump yard todate in chattanooga our alltime record operating ratio for a quarter as well as for the first half of the year is a testament to our strategic plan and the hard work of our employees as shown on slide  there were significant milestones achieved in the quarter as well as the first half of the year that were key drivers of our success the efforts towards driving locomotive productivity fuel efficiency and train length which we will discuss in more detail later in the presentation all helped to drive our record operating ratio as noted on slide  we are continuing to take steps to improve service and reduce cost we idled our largest hump yard yet in chattanooga in the second quarter and this is the fourth major hump yard idled we have also announced the consolidation of our central division which will further reduce the number of operating divisions from  to  this is a continuation of the steps we took in  wherein we consolidated from  to  divisions and reduced the number of operating regions by a third in addition as we discussed on our last call we removed another  locomotives from service in the second quarter and we did so while handling more volume all of these actions drive the pillars of our strategic plan safety service productivity and growth and puts us ontrack to exceed  million of annual productivity savings this year moving to safety on slide  we are pleased to see a  improvement in our reportable injury ratio as well as a  improvement in our serious injury ratio these reductions demonstrate our continued dedication to maintaining a safe and productive working environment for our employees throughout operations which is a cornerstone of our strategy working safely and efficiently is a key component of our efforts to drive sustainable valuecreation our network metric performance shown here on slide  did trend down in the second quarter due to a number of episodic events that were concentrated in the southeast more importantly our metrics have trended higher in the recent weeks we are confident we will remain at these high levels while handling the additional volume and continuing to aggressively pursue productivity initiatives our customerfacing metrics are allowing us to have specific datadriven discussions with our customers deepening our already strong relationships moving to some of our productivity initiatives starting on slide  you can see we continued to increase employee productivity which is driven by optimizing our train plan as well as our improvements in train length as you may recall  was a record year for train length and we are on track to set a new record for the full year of  the second quarter was the highest quarterly train length on record and june represented the highest monthly train length at norfolk southern this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement and we are excited to build on our momentum as shown on slide  train length along with the continued rationalization of our yard and local fleets has resulted in significant improvements in our locomotive productivity we removed  locomotives from service in  and another  so far this year the second quarter was the highest quarter of locomotive productivity in our company history and we are on pace to set a new record for the full year we will continue to actively manage our locomotives to ensure we are driving the highest value for shareholders while we continue to support the needs of our customers not only do these improvements result in lower maintenance cost they also enhance our fuel efficiency which i will discuss on slide  our fuel efficiency improved  in the second quarter versus the same period last year and resulted in an alltime quarterly record as you may recall  was a record year for this measurement we accomplished this by continuing to improve train lengths locomotive rationalizations and implementing our energy management initiatives together these initiatives continue to drive improvements for this measurement in closing we are confident we will continue to provide a level of service to our customers that will grow our business while at the same time driving longterm productivity savings and superior returns for shareholders we are proud of the accomplishments we have made and continue to identify opportunities to drive additional efficiencies for the benefit of ns shareholders i will now turn it over to marta who will cover our financial achievements marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp thank you mike and good morning everyone lets begin with our summarized second quarter results on slide  the continued execution of our strategic plan delivered a  increase in revenues which when coupled with only a  increase in expenses resulted in more than  million of additional operating income and as jim noted an alltime recordlow quarterly operating ratio of  turning to the component changes in operating expenses on slide  in total they were higher by  million or  as our sustained focus on controlling expenses helped mitigate costs associated with inflation and with the  volume increase slide  highlights the drivers of the variance in compensation and benefits which rose by  million or  yearoveryear as i mentioned on last quarters call inflationary increases continue at a quarterly run rate of  million to  million which is higher than historically primarily due to the large increase in premiums on union medical plans also previously noted is an increase in incentive compensation associated with the improvement in operating results partially offsetting these items were reduced employee levels which resulted in  million of lower expense as head count was more than  employees lower than the second quarter of  and down almost  sequentially with the efficiency improvements mike mentioned we now expect that we can hold overall head count at this lower level for the remainder of the year fuel expense as shown on slide  rose by  million entirely attributable to higher prices which added  million fuel efficiency continues to improve and as mike mentioned we achieved a record on this metric which resulted in  fewer gallons consumed on  more volume moving on to purchased services and rents on slide  this category was up  million or  yearoveryear largely due to the increase in intermodal traffic slide  displays other income which rose  million for the quarter due principally to higher returns on corporateowned life insurance and increased income from coal property turning to income taxes on slide  the effective rate for the quarter was  unchanged from the second quarter of  summarizing second quarter earnings on slide  net income was  million up  compared with  and diluted earnings per share were  up  versus the second quarter of last year wrapping up our financial overview on slide  free cash flow for the first six months was nearly  million up  million versus the prior year and as jim noted with the improvement in cash flow and our confidence in future free cash generation we have increased our fullyear target for share repurchases from  million to  billion thanks for your attention and i now turn the call back to jim james a squires  norfolk southern corp as evidenced by our record results just a year and a half into our plan our team is engaged and energized having consistently delivered strong performance we are confident in our ability to reach a sub operating ratio by  or sooner additionally as we reach our targets well continue to achieve improvements that drive shareholder value before taking your questions i want to thank marta for her many contributions and devoted service over the years as she will retire from norfolk southern on august  shes been an outstanding leader in our organization a terrific member of the management team and instrumental to norfolk southerns success on a personal note shes also been a trusted partner and a great friend so it is a bittersweet goodbye for me our search for martas successor is ongoing we are working with a nationally recognized executive search firm and are considering both external and internal candidates while the search continues the board has elected tom hurlbut currently vp and controller to the position of interim cfo effective august  and with that well now open the line for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you well now be conducting a questionandanswer session due to the number of analysts joining us in the call today please ask one primary question and one followup question to accommodate as many participants as possible our first question today is from the line of allison landry with credit suisse please proceed with your questions allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc thanks good morning so i just wanted to ask about the longterm target it seemed like there was sort of a slight shift in the language previously youve talked about a  or below by  and now its sort of  by  or sooner should we read anything into that as youre stepping up the operational initiatives as well as various customer projects or really is it just semantics james a squires  norfolk southern corp good morning allison let me start by pointing out again that the second quarter of this year represented our sixth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear or improvements and alltime records in both the quarter and for the first half so our plan is working as planned and its allowing us to deliver a lot of financial improvements through operational gains so we are very confident that we can reach our goals and were pulling all the levers weve got the pedal to the metal and as soon as we can get there we will allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc okay so would you characterize that with the good results over the last few quarters as maybe pulling that target forward a little bit james a squires  norfolk southern corp yeah things are going really well the plan is working as planned and were making rapid progress so yes we are very confident allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc okay great and then if i could just ask about the third quarter historically the or is flat to slightly down on a sequential basis so as i think about some of the puts and takes in the volume side that you discussed earlier is that still the right way to think about it or are there any cost items or other items that might drive a deviation from historical patterns james a squires  norfolk southern corp we do feel confident well post a lower operating ratio yearoveryear in the second half of the year now the pace of improvements quarterbyquarter will depend on various factors long term obviously the drivers are our top line growth in productivity and that doesnt change quarterbyquarter things like real estate gains can make a difference can tip the balance and recall that in the third quarter of last year we did have a significant real estate gain allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc okay great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jason seidl with cowen and company please proceed with your questions jason seidl  cowen and company llc wow thank you very much could you parse out some of those comments you made about episodic events in the second quarter impacting you a little bit on the negative side and then maybe talk about how your metrics are trending up and what that can mean on a sequential basis and how were looking at your numbers from q to q james a squires  norfolk southern corp sure well let me set the backdrop and then ill hand it off to mike to talk about some of the specific things we encountered in the second quarter you did see network velocity slow down a little bit in the second quarter and you saw dwell tick up some weve turned a corner on that third quarter todate the metrics are looking good we are steadfast in our commitment to deliver quality service and customer value and network performance even through the second quarter of this year remained well above  levels and as i said its been trending higher so this is the platform for growth and we are committed to keeping network performance and service performance at a level that allows us to grow and drives productivity as well so with that mike why dont you comment a little bit on some of the things we experienced in the second quarter michael j wheeler  norfolk southern corp yeah okay will do so we had really three things that were going on they were going on pretty close together but we had a lot of flooding pretty much between louisville and kansas city on that line during the quarter we also had some flooding just outside of our cincinnati terminal which is a highvolume terminal there during the quarter we had some fires going on down in north florida that were shutting our line down different times during the third quarter theyd come near the tracks so we shut the tracks down and opened it back up so those three things were going on dealt with those through the quarter and we feel very comfortable about how we bounced back in the last month our train speed has increased  back to prior levels and our dwells back to what it was prior to some of these stuff so feel real comfortable about how weve responded and returned service to where we want it to be and it continues to trend higher and were going to continue to work on that alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp so allison this is alan – or jason excuse me jason seidl  cowen and company llc jason alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp yeah excuse me jason so jason seidl  cowen and company llc shes the better looking one alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp we have seen improvement since the beginning of the third quarter weve seen it in our network performance metrics weve seen it in our customerfacing metrics and more importantly as jim and mike and i get out and talk to our customers we see it in the feedback from our customers they sense the improvement theyre seeing the improvement in our service product michael j wheeler  norfolk southern corp yes and were pleased with where its at and were going to continue to keep it there continue to further improve jason seidl  cowen and company llc all right i guess my followup is going to be more on the top line side we did as you know our big railroad shipper survey and your eastern competitor probably got the worst ratings and service and we just held dinner last night with some railroad people and clearly theyre having some service challenges over there have you seen freight come over from the other eastern railroads due to poorerthanexpected service where it can come over and if its come over has it come over at regular pricing or have you been able to actually increase the pricing on that james a squires  norfolk southern corp look jason again let me just set the stage here and im going to let alan comment specifically on whats going on with the top line in that regard but first off our focus is very much on enhancing value at nsc and driving our plan to continue to drive productivity and growth and growth is an important part of that plan well take the market share whether its from truck or competitors as long as it complements our network and obviously falls to the bottom line those are the keys so alan what are you seeing in terms of the landscape jason seidl  cowen and company llc hey alan alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp jason we are always talking to our customers as jim noted our primary form of competition is truck but were talking to our customers about service products that offer a sustainable view of their markets and allow them to grow and we have seen some business move over to us its a small amount ill tell you that but its early weve got a really good service product the customers value the continuity of our market approach of our operating philosophy and our focus on allowing them to grow with their customers jason seidl  cowen and company llc okay gentlemen thank you for the time and marta congratulations on the retirement and best of luck to you marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp thank you operator the next question is from the line of tom wadewitz with ubs please proceed with your question thomas wadewitz  ubs securities llc yeah good morning and also wanted to extend the best wishes to you marta in retirement lets see i guess the question on rail competition and kind of customer conversations and so forth you gave us some perspective on that i think alan you said its early i guess with the nature of the customer conversations recently would you say that this is something thats likely to build in terms of the potential for us and business to come over or would you say look business kind of naturally falls to one or the other and you really shouldnt consider too much in terms of share gain as you look the next couple of quarters how would you frame that james a squires  norfolk southern corp yeah again let me do the framing and then hand it off to alan i want to emphasize that we have been in front of our customers a lot that is just a part of our regular routine mike alan and i are in front of our customers all the time we are going to them we are in their offices and their conference rooms hearing about their business and how we can gain more of it so thats a big focus for all three of us we want the feedback from our customers all the time and were getting it so alan talk a little bit more about the market share opportunity alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp so were going to capitalize on opportunities that fit our network and if customers see that we provide a predictable efficient service product that meets their needs whether thats in competition with truck or another rail carrier then were going to go after that business jim as long as it fits our network and we can drive value to our shareholders thomas wadewitz  ubs securities llc okay but when you said its early does that imply that there might be some building in the opportunity or am i overreading that comment alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp ill tell you that the average duration of our contract is three years and so it takes time for some things to play out thomas wadewitz  ubs securities llc right okay i guess for the followup question it seems you had weakness in  and  in coal some other ngrelated areas then you had pretty significant strength yearoveryear in the first half i think were kind of – so the industrys transitioning to a slower pace of growth in volume overall how does that affect how you would view the opportunity for margin improvement yearoveryear or if you want us to take it and say were really focused on productivity just trying to think about how we think of those two things productivity or improvement as you may have a slower yearoveryear volume growth backdrop looking forward james a squires  norfolk southern corp let me comment generally with respect to our coal customers as with all of our customers our goal is to serve them and that means having the resources available to serve them when the demand is there when they need our service so we are committed to that were committed to serving our coal customers as with all our other customers as well alan in terms of resource deployment and market opportunity what are you seeing alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp well tom within coal i was with several of our coal customers just last week and there is optimism particularly on the export side for continued strength throughout the year as you know the benchmark moved in the mids to  just within a span of a couple of weeks as the chinese reported record steel production in june i was also with some intermodal customers and theyre commenting about how theyre starting to see tightness in the truck market thats important for us because as weve noted truck is our primary form of competition and so as you see spot rates move up double digit within the last couple of months and maybe start to move above contract rates that portends well for both volume and pricing opportunities for us into  thomas wadewitz  ubs securities llc okay great thank you operator next question is from the line of amit mehrotra with deutsche bank please proceed with your question amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks so much for taking my questions first one is on the automotive business you mentioned the headwind from auto production in the second half but general motors production specifically i think is expected to be down as much as  in the third quarter thats not necessarily organic i guess its due to the change over their light truck platform i think you guys have some disproportionate exposure there on the fort wayne line if you could just talk about the impact there i think itll probably be onetime given the changeover effect but any color on maybe what that could have in terms of revenue growth and then also fixed cost absorption in the automotive franchise that would be helpful thank you james a squires  norfolk southern corp automotive production in the us declined  in the second quarter its supposed to be down  in the third quarter thats the largest yearoveryear decline that is currently being projected and so consequently we see a decline within our automotive volumes particularly in the third quarter amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc yeah i know that but the question was really on the disproportionate exposure to general motors and the fact that that business is going to be down  what type of impact that may have disproportionally to your exposure in the auto business james a squires  norfolk southern corp were not going to discuss specific customer relationships i think ive given you some good color as to what we see within our automotive market for the back half of the year amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats fair and then one followup with me just piggybacking on the last question with respect to or expansion in the back half i mean the contribution margins – the incremental margins in the first half have just been unbelievably strong those productivity initiatives have definitely dropped to the bottom line and then the business obviously really capitalintensive but just a question on your ability to maintain the incremental margins that you did in the first half in the second half obviously mixes volumes are not going to be as strong as they were in the first half but then the productivity and the head count will stay flat sequentially so just the puts and takes there in terms of your ability to maintain incremental margins maybe in the neighborhood of where they were in the first half thatd be helpful thank you james a squires  norfolk southern corp the key is the plans dynamism and flexibility and thats what we have done for the last year and a half we have responded to changing business conditions as necessary to continue driving results and so when necessary well lean into productivity and for the long term its all about a multidimensional approach a combination of growth and productivity at any given time maybe its a little bit more growth maybe its a little bit more productivity so well be flexible amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc okay all right guys thanks for taking my questions appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of ravi shanker with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions ravi shanker  morgan stanley  co llc thanks good morning everyone can you just comment on pricing in the second quarter and kind of the gap to inflation kind of how you see that evolving through the year because it does look like inflation was higher in the second quarter and is probably going to accelerate into the second half of the year james a squires  norfolk southern corp yeah our rate of yearoveryear pricing growth in the second quarter was consistent with what we saw in the first quarter and the rate of yearoveryear pricing growth was consistent with what we saw in  so were committed to focusing on price and recognizing the value of the service product that we provide and were committed to pricing longterm above inflation ravi shanker  morgan stanley  co llc but do you feel like youre going to get there in the second half of this year as well james a squires  norfolk southern corp yes ravi shanker  morgan stanley  co llc got it and as a followup in the intermodal market are you confident that the rising tide of pricing in all of trucking will help intermodal pricing over time im just wondering if theres enough overlap between the kind of momandpop truckers who are most impacted by elds and the intermodal market as it stands right now james a squires  norfolk southern corp yeah we are very confident that its going to provide pricing opportunity for us and its going to provide volume opportunities for us weve got great channel partners out there who are working to grow their business and weve got a service product and schedules that support their growth now most of that growth from elds will come in  ravi shanker  morgan stanley  co llc got it makes sense thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken hoexter bank of america please proceed with your question ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch us great good morning and also congrats to marta on her retirement great working with you over the years michael or jim can you talk about the experience on the hump yard in chattanooga you shut it down did you convert that to a flat yard did you shift the business elsewhere just want to understand is that replicable as you think about your network or was this just from maybe shrinking business in that region and you didnt need it and you moved it elsewhere can you maybe walk though a little bit about that michael j wheeler  norfolk southern corp sure will so we idled the hump but we are using that yard and its in a great location for us because it has a lot of feeder lines from our network going into it to do block swapping so while we idled the hump we now do a lot more block swapping we do more blocking further into the network so it is giving us good productivity because the cars are getting through there faster and providing even better service because of less time on the network getting to the customers so thats the piece to it where its a big yard in a great location to be able to do a large amount of block swapping ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch us and again michael maybe your thoughts on is that something thats replicable to other yards i mean you talked about the number of hump yards in the past is that something you plan on continuing the conversions to other yards michael j wheeler  norfolk southern corp we continue to look at it it has to make sense it has to end up getting traffic through the network faster and taking cost out or a balance between the two and were only going to do if it hits those criteria ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch us so when you look at this example is it something thats accelerating and you look at it and say were going to do more or is this just a oneoff i just want to understand if this is something you can replicate to your other yards michael j wheeler  norfolk southern corp yeah and we can replicate it to other yards it may be in yards that arent necessarily hump yards and do more of the block swapping in locations where it makes sense something weve been doing over the last couple of years but weve done it more aggressively lately and this is one piece of it and were doing it more aggressively at other locations ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch us all right great marta if i can have a followup with you on your employee levels you talked about being flat going forward maybe talk about the cost per employee impacts there you talked about a couple of things that drove costs up in the quarter can you talk about that up  yearoveryear on a cost per employee base is that something you look to continue in the back half of the year or is there something that can maybe slow down on the increased cost marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp well ken the cost per employee was up in the second quarter as you noticed and it was up for two reasons one of them is the one weve been talking about all year and thats the  inflation which is higher than normal inflation and the other factor why in the second quarter the cost per employee was up was due to the incentive comp and you should expect to see the increase in incentive comp continue in the third and fourth quarters ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch us all right thank you marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp youre welcome operator our next question is from the line of chris wetherbee with citigroup please proceed with your questions chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc hey thanks good morning wanted to talk a little bit about productivity and sort of the progress to the  million target that you talked about can you give us a sense of sort of how far along in that you are so far through the year and maybe some of the potential variability the drivers in the second half of the year particularly in a slightly lower or potentially meaningfully lower volume growth environment james a squires  norfolk southern corp were making excellent progress in productivity you saw mikes data points there record locomotive productivity record fuel productivity and acrosstheboard significant cost savings as a result so were going to continue to push were not done we will continue to strive for ever better productivity performance in all of the areas where it matters most employees and locomotives and fuel efficiency and facilities and so on chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful i guess trying to get a sense do you think theres sort of upside potential to that  million i dont know sort of how youre thinking about sort of the ability to – i know you talked about it being continually adjustable but just kind of curious about that james a squires  norfolk southern corp yeah we think well be able to do better than the  million chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful appreciate it and then a quick followup on coal and specifically thinking about sort of the export market alan you mentioned sort of an increase in the seaborne prices when you think about sort of the second half or maybe more specifically about the third quarter should we see yields in coal collectively kind of mirror what we saw in the second quarter just trying to get some sense around that because theres been some volatility with the mix of your business and sort of exports when theyre moving and when theyre not alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp hey chris very good questions so the seaborne price in the second quarter of the year was closer to about  a metric ton now its closer to  and so within export there will be pressure on pricing although we still expect and are confident that its going to be up yearoveryear the rest of the impact on rpu is going to just be highly dependent upon the mix within our utility franchise and whether we handle more usouth or more unorth last year we were handling – about  of our utility coal was usouth which tends to be longerhaul and higherrated this quarter it was about  so that puts pressure on rpu also chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc and  is probably a good number to use going forward for this year alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp its going to be dependent on the weather chris chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc okay thanks for the time i appreciate it operator the next question is from the line of justin long with stephens please proceed with your questions justin long  stephens inc thanks and good morning maybe to follow up first on that last question i wanted to ask about your expectation for consolidated rpu going forward i know there a lot of moving pieces but when you think about export coal likely to moderate sequentially intermodal looking like it will be the leader in terms of nearterm volume growth just from a directional standpoint do you think that rpu ex fuel can still be up yearoveryear in the second half alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp i think weve given you a lot of inputs on it justin if you look at our rpu for our seven major commodity groups in the second quarter it was up between  and  and our total rpu was up  so its heavily influenced by mix ive given you some guidance on our utility coal volumes our export coal volumes what were seeing in intermodal and what were seeing in merchandise so were very confident in our approach to pricing and the level of yearoveryear price increases we get the overall rpu for the corporation that falls out is going to be heavily dependent upon those mix factors justin long  stephens inc okay and maybe to follow up on some of the market share questions earlier i was curious if there were any major contract wins or losses during the quarter that we should keep in mind for the back half of this year in  and then as a followup to that looking out over the next  months how much of your total book of business do you expect to reprice james a squires  norfolk southern corp hi justin as i talked about any market share shift that weve seen so far in the early stages is pretty minimal its there but its minimal so far for this year weve got – about  of our revenue is committed most of what is uncommitted so far for the remainder of this year is in export and in any given year were going to renegotiate about  to  of our revenues justin long  stephens inc great thats really helpful i appreciate the time today operator our next question comes from the line of walter spracklin with rbc please proceed with your questions walter spracklin  rbc dominion securities inc thanks very much good morning everyone just wanted to go back to coal for a moment and i know its difficult to forecast out but youve given us good color into the back half of the year as youre situating and talking to your customers about  and kind of assuming no significant changes in weather patterns how are stockpile levels among your customers that would give you indication as to just directionally on both export and domestic utility do you expect itd be higher lower or about the same compared to the  levels james a squires  norfolk southern corp walter good question so right now stockpile levels at utilities that we serve and this is a publicly available number are about  days below where they were last year however we recognize theyre still  days above target so weve made a lot of improvement over the last  months in the stockpile levels june was very mild and that significantly impact coal burn to the negative last year in june stockpiles dropped by about six days this year they only dropped by about one day so as i think about the outlook going forward july has been hot natural gas prices while down versus june are still up above where they were this time last year and so its going to be heavily dependent upon how the rest of the summer weighs out in terms of load demand and natural gas prices and thats just a function of the fact of coal being a load follower walter spracklin  rbc dominion securities inc right so too early to tell even directionally which way you see coal going in  james a squires  norfolk southern corp its going to be heavily dependent upon how the summer plays out we had a very very hot summer last year and that really benefited our volumes and our utility coal franchise through the second half of last year and through the first quarter of this year walter spracklin  rbc dominion securities inc okay fair enough just housekeeping now for marta other income run rate i know it moves around a lot is there even an annual number i know you kind of dipped down last year from  million down to  million and now maybe turning back up at around over  million is there kind of a run rate even on an annual level we can plug in there and also tax rate going into  are you seeing any major changes in the guidance youve given for this year going into  marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp well walter you have it about right and looking at last few years estimate about  million as you know theres a lot of different pieces in there so estimating that for the annual is probably the best thing you can do looking at the recent years average and then what was your question walter spracklin  rbc dominion securities inc and theres tax where youve been guiding us at kind of around  but longer term you talked a bit about  so were using a  for the back half of the year and   and beyond is there any reason why we should change that marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp im glad you asked that question too because you should be using a  for the full year and it has been lower in the first half for the reasons we discussed in the first quarter in the third quarter we expect an increase above  because theres a state tax law change which is increasing their income tax rate and therefore we expect to have about  million of additional because we have to adjust our deferred taxes so when you work that into the mix for the full year we expect the rate to be about  walter spracklin  rbc dominion securities inc okay thats great and  into  as well marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp yes sir walter spracklin  rbc dominion securities inc okay thank you very much operator our next question is from the line of brandon oglenski with barclays please proceed with your questions brandon oglenski  barclays capital inc yes good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question and congrats marta marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp thank you brandon oglenski  barclays capital inc would be nice so i wanted to come back to the first question on this call jim or maybe even marta on the sequential outcome in or if i look back maybe last five or six years i think you guys are averaging a back half or thats down maybe a  basis points to  basis points sequentially but you guys did talk about sequential declines in metals weve talked about the coal situation with exports most likely coming down and head count being flat from here i mean should we think that that normal relationship holds this year or do those items potentially mean its less or more james a squires  norfolk southern corp as i said we do expect a lower second half operating ratio versus  now quarterbyquarter things like the timing of real estate gains which are difficult to predict can tip the balance versus the prior year and also bear in the mind that in the third quarter of last year we did have a significant real estate gain now long term its all about growth and productivity those will be the drivers of improved operating ratio and earnings brandon oglenski  barclays capital inc okay jim and i guess following up from that how important is volume growth in  to maintaining the trajectory on or improvement lets just say we have another dull year and cant get hotter growth from the network is that going to push plans back a bit youve talked a lot about the dynamic plans so what can be dynamic about it next year if we dont see growth for the industry james a squires  norfolk southern corp sure volume growth is certainly one piece of the puzzle pricing is another in the top line and then its all about expense control and driving productivity we demonstrated the ability to drive productivity to the benefit of a lower operating ratio and earnings growth in  when we didnt see much volume growth and thats what well do again if thats the way  plays out brandon oglenski  barclays capital inc okay thank you operator our next question is from the line of bascome majors with susquehanna please proceed with your questions bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp yeah thank you i wanted to drill down a little bit more on the merchandise portfolio i think its pretty wellunderstood the challenges youre seeing in auto some of the challenges that youre seeing in another parts of that portfolio but also some of the growth youre seeing in the frac sand business but if we can take a step back and maybe think about the industrial merchandise the noncrude chemicals the paper and forest products thatkind of core industrial business whats the outlook for these non sort of specific issues youre focused in do you think well see growth in those parts of the portfolio in the second half of the year and what are you hearing from customers alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp bascome what were hearing from customers is theres optimism certainly the plastics franchise will continue to be strong for us as polyethylene plants come online lumber has been impacted by tariffs and kind of an inventory overhang we think thatll unwind itself in the third quarter but thatll put pressure on third quarter volumes ag is going to be dependent upon crops we participated in soybean exports last year now while thats less than  of our overall revenue were probably not going to have as much of a soybean export program this year because south american production has been so strong generally though if you look at things industrial production has improved each of the last five months and manufacturing seems to have firmed so longer term were focused on growing this part of our franchise thats why our industrial development department is so critical to what we do and you heard jim talk about it our pipeline is very robust for new projects probably more robust than its been since the great recession now that wont necessarily drive volumes this year but thats longerterm growth opportunities to us that indicates confidence on the part of our customers in the economy and confidence on the part of our customers and doing business with norfolk southern over the long term bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp i appreciate that comprehensive answer there just wanted to clarify i think you said you expect merchandise volumes to be down low to midsingle digits yearoveryear in the third quarter can you just confirm that go ahead alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp yeah bascome thats what i said bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp yeah and if i look sequentially that implies a little weaker quarteroverquarter trend than you typically see in the book as a whole is that just a function of some of the auto pressure is there something else going on there or maybe even some conservatism alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp yeah bascome that is a function of the auto pressure its also as i noted second quarter steel volumes were benefited from a slight inventory rebuilding and youve seen steel prices and capacity factors pulled back in may and june now theyve improved a little bit in july so well see how that plays out but it also reflects a little bit of pressure on steel in the third quarter bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you very much operator our next question is from the line of scott group with wolfe research please proceed with your questions scott h group  wolfe research llc hey thanks good morning guys alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp scott scott h group  wolfe research llc so just wanted to follow up there just on this kind of auto steel discussion obviously we can see that auto is  of your total revenue this quarter but when you think about the derivatives that go into the auto sector what percentage of your total business do you think is tied to autos and as we think about autos and steel and maybe some of the other derivatives falling in the back half should we think about those as having higher or lower than normal incremental margins alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp scott there are some inputs into it certainly carbon black or plastics or steel are the primary ones auto doesnt make up a material portion of our volumes in those groups but if theres a pullback in auto thatll have a little bit of pressure in those markets scott h group  wolfe research llc but is there any way to say like so yeah direct autos are  of the business but we add up all the derivatives that total exposure to autos is  or  i dont know is there any way that you could just try and help put that in perspective alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp its not a material number scott h group  wolfe research llc youre saying not materially above the  that we can see thats directly auto alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp right it does have an impact but its – youve noted a  to  or  its not in that range scott h group  wolfe research llc okay okay good and then just on the utility coal side utility coal volumes were up  in the second quarter it looks like the guidance for the third quarter is that utility coal is going to be down yearoveryear im surprised down just given that you still have the contract win from csx so did we hear that right and given that dynamic and then what you talked about on the export side do you think rpu and coal is positive or negative in aggregate in the third quarter alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp scott you did hear that right thats exactly how i guided if you recall third quarter of last year we saw a significant jump in our coal volume sequentially from about  million tons in second quarter of last year to over  million tons in the third quarter of this year that benefited from a very hot start to the summer including june we havent seen that this year and so that puts pressure on our utility coal volumes in the quarter scott h group  wolfe research llc and then just – so given that dynamic of utility coal down export up but export rates falling a little bit in aggregate do you think coal rpu is positive or negative yearoveryear in the third i know you said exports positive im just trying to think in aggregate for coal alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp we wont guide the specific rpus in specific markets on a quarterly basis but youve got all the right thoughts there in terms of the moving parts scott h group  wolfe research llc okay all right thank you guys appreciate it and best of luck to you marta marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp thank you operator the next question is from the line of cherilyn radbourne with td securities please proceed with your questions cherilyn radbourne  td securities inc thanks very much and good morning james a squires  norfolk southern corp good morning cherilyn radbourne  td securities inc wanted to ask a question about your strategy of integrating more closely with customers across the supply chain can you talk about how broadly youre approaching that have you started with a few key customers or a few key business lines or is it more general than that james a squires  norfolk southern corp well we did begin by doing some focus groups with key customers across various parts of our business and then we have taken that feedback along with feedback we have received from a bigger group of customers and some of that feedback has been informal as weve been out there meeting and talking with our customers some of it has been more formalized we took all of that we have been working on redesigning our customer interfaces our equipment strategies sitting down with the customers about service parameters what do you consider to be service excellence well thats what we are going to try to deliver and so its been a very broadbased and comprehensive effort to taking our customers feedback to understand their service needs and to redesign our network around what they want cherilyn radbourne  td securities inc and just by way of a quick followup as we go forward how do you plan to internally measure success is it economy plus growth or some other metric james a squires  norfolk southern corp well a couple of dimensions there certainly one measure of success would be how we are doing from a service standpoint relative to the shared kpis we have developed with our customers and then we will recognize success in both top line growth and margin expansion – margin expansion and bottom line growth i mean thats the key obviously is to garner revenue growth that translates to better margins and a better bottom line cherilyn radbourne  td securities inc great thank you for the time and my best wishes to marta as well marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brian ossenbeck with jpmorgan please proceed with your questions brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question james a squires  norfolk southern corp good morning brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc i just had a quick one on ptc positive train control if you can just give us a sense of where you are this year in terms of opex and da whats in the  numbers and when you look forward to  obviously theres still a lot of moving parts the systems being developed and tested but i imagine you have some idea whats baked into your  guidance so can you just kind of give us a starting point where youre at now and where you expect that to settle in  when the system comes online james a squires  norfolk southern corp well let me comment on the state of implementation and then ill turn it over to marta to address the expense components so were making excellent progress on ptc we do expect to meet the deadlines and have the system fully installed next year and then we will begin then to turn it on across the board so everything is going very well in terms of the implementation longer term were seeing an opportunity to utilize ptc in various ways so thats all a good thing now marta why dont you talk about the expense components of ptc going forward marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp certainly well the first thing to note is that the ptcrelated costs are included in our longrange guidance and so mikes folks have estimated what they think the cost will be associated with that and has included it in all of our plans so now with regard particularly to this year we expect that well have – we have included in depreciation probably about  million going forward upon total completion itll probably be about  million but again its in our expectation with regard to the maintenance cost the way his team is approaching that is to include the ptc maintenance for the years going forward as part of our overall maintenance budget so we dont have a specific number for that because theyre integrating the work in with their other work mike do you have anything to add to that michael j wheeler  norfolk southern corp no but from a dollar standpoint its not a material increase in those costs but again its already marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp because youre incorporating it into michael j wheeler  norfolk southern corp yeah incorporated into and its already in our  plan brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc okay so it sounds like the biggest increases then come from just depreciating the assets that youre putting into place and you feel like part of the maintenance you can kind of leverage with what youre already doing on the network marta r stewart  norfolk southern corp yes i mean it certainly has additional extra work with it but theyre going to incorporate it with it and going forward of course for reporting purposes in the r and so forth we will break out the portion thats ptc but again the important point that mike and i are both making is that it is integrated with our plan brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and then just a quick followup for alan you talked about the trucking market getting tighter in  and you posted record intermodal volumes this quarter so maybe if you can just talk a little bit more about the international side some of the port activity picking up on the east coast investments being made bridges being raised that sort of thing how those partnerships are progressing and when you might expect to see some of that activity alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp hey brian good question weve got some great relationships with our steamship lines and our port partners and weve benefited from the shift of volume from the west coast to east coast our imports through the east coast are up  in the quarter and so we have seen already the benefit of that growth in volume and expect to continue to do so brian p ossenbeck  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for your time this morning operator our next question is from the line of john larkin with stifel please proceed with your questions john griffith larkin  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks for taking my question good morning everybody james a squires  norfolk southern corp john john griffith larkin  stifel nicolaus  co inc and best wishes to you marta just wanted to ask a bit of a brain teaser on the rpu math i think alan youd mentioned that of the top seven commodity groups the rpu there has risen yearoveryear somewhere between  and  depending upon the commodity group yet the overall rpu growth is up  could you explain what im missing there in terms of that translation from a bunch of groups growing  to  yet the overall is growing at only  alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp yeah john its a mix impact rpu is up between  and  for each of our seven commodity groups yearoveryear in the second quarter however if a large percentage of your volume growth is in lowerrated intermodal while intermodal rpu can be up  itll have a drag on the overall rpu for the company so thats an important fact to remember as we look at rpu it isnt always reflective of price or of value to the corporation john griffith larkin  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay that is very helpful and then just maybe a followon regarding the ptc line of questioning a couple of questioners ago as you look out its pretty clear that you planned out through  and maybe beyond as that ptc capex begins to fall off and you have gotten the network into great shape and made a lot of the operational changes that youre going through now where do you see the sort of longrun capex settling out as a percentage of revenue there is one railroad youre aware of im sure that has targeted sort of a  number is that a sustainable number and reasonable to apply to norfolk southern or do you have a different dynamic at work james a squires  norfolk southern corp well john postptc we do see capex coming down somewhat as a share of revenue for example exactly where that lands i think well have to see really theres no fixed ideology there our goal is to invest as much as we possibly can and generate shareholder value and appropriate return on capital so thats the goal but as much but not more than we can while generating excellent returns so i think well see its likely to come down postptc but again its really all about paying close attention to the return on capital make sure were generating an appropriate return and investing just enough to do that john griffith larkin  stifel nicolaus  co inc sounds terrific thanks very much operator our final question comes from the line of david vernon with bernstein research please proceed with your question j david scott vernon  sanford c bernstein  co llc hey good morning alan maybe when you talk about the tightening of the truck market as you think about how thats going to impact core price and maybe even volume a little bit when should we start to expect that to come in if we see this sort of sustained tightening of the truck market that some of the truckers are talking about right now when should it show up in the norfolk pl or core pricing metrics alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp david i believe thatll start to show up in  itll have to be reflected through trucking bid season later in the year and then so well start to see it in our contract negotiations later in the year and into next year potentially we could start to see it in volume later in the year but youll see it in pricing in  j david scott vernon  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay and then maybe just a quick followup i think in talking to some guys who are on the coal field there is a little bit of speculation that the recent uptick in the met coal settlement is a result of us miners maybe not having the capacity to just pull out more production for met are you hearing anything about the supply constraints kind of restricting availability of us met coal exports or is that something that you feel your customers are going to be able to respond to if demand stays strong alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp i think a lot of what weve heard is its a result of the increase in chinese steel production and the australians have taken some production offline they guided to that were going to continue to watch production and david to your point production is going to limit probably our export volume in the second half of the year j david scott vernon  sanford c bernstein  co llc but that should still give you an ability to kind of benefit from the price without the volume though right alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp yes james a squires  norfolk southern corp right alan h shaw  norfolk southern corp it will j david scott vernon  sanford c bernstein  co llc all right thanks operator thank you at this time i will turn the floor back to jim squires for closing comments
