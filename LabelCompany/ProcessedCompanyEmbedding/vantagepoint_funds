the portfolio holdings and strategies of those funds the targeted allocation of each underlying milestone fund’s assets among underlying funds and the asset classes they represent is determined by icmarc the investment adviser to the vt iii vantagepoint funds over time icmarc will adjust the asset allocation of each “dated” milestone fund to seek to become more conservative as the year designated in its name approaches and for approximately  years beyond the designated year this is intended to reduce investment risk as investors move toward and into retirement however there is no guarantee that this goal will be achieved and investors may lose money investing in the milestone funds ten years after the date in the milestone fund’s name it will reach its “landing point” and its target asset allocation becomes constant it is expected that when a milestone fund reaches its “landing point” it will merge with the milestone retirement income fundthe asset allocation changes that

vantagepoint our flagship product vantagepoint is a powerful textmining tool for discovering knowledge in search results from patent and literature databases vantagepoint helps you rapidly understand and navigate through large search results giving you a better perspective—a better vantage point—on your information the perspective provided by vantagepoint enables you to quickly find who what when and where enabling you to clarify relationships and find critical patterns—turning your information into knowledge vantagepoint works with search results from text databases first conduct a search using a search engine provided by your database provider then download the raw data to your computer and import it into vantagepoint using an import filter vantagepoint is most useful when your search strategy returns more than you want to read it can provide great benefit when working with only a few dozen records but it is most helpful when you need to work with thousands of records vantagepoint’s capabilities can be broadly classified into five categories importing – getting the raw data into vantagepoint and mining the raw data to get more data from it cleaning – transforming the data into a consistent set combining the things that you want to analyze as a group and merging and normalizing data from diverse sources analyzing – looking at your data in a variety of ways reporting – preparing to communicate your results automating – encoding the entire process to make it consistently and easily repeatable the menu at the topright of this page lists just a few of vantagepoint’s major features browse these pages to get an overview of how vantagepoint can help you get good answers quickly    extracting and indexing data  after a search the user imports the data into vantagepoint—a onetime event for each dataset fields are mined from the text using pattern matching rulebased and natural language processing techniques to obtain fields found in most bibliographic databases for example authors inventors affiliations assignees dates descriptors index terms and classification codes normalized values that are sometimes buried in the basic fielded data or presented in mixed formats such as dates classification codes or patent numbers meaningful words and phrases from the titles abstracts patent claims and other free text and entities defined in usermanaged dictionaries for this import process vantagepoint uses import filters which can be specifically tailored for each database database provider and your particular requirements our import engine is a powerful tool for leveraging the value that is hidden in your data there are three ways to handle your import filters our online library contains more than  import filters covering a large proportion of the patent business science and technology databases and it is freely available to our customers our support team can create and customize import filters to your requirements vantagepoint comes with all of the tools you need to doityourself top  lists  you can browse your data from many perspectives the simplest tool is a list using a list of affiliations or authors or countries you can see the top affiliations or authors or countries and browse the records for each one you can sort and search your lists in an instant and create groups in your lists in many different ways list comparison lets you compare any two lists from any set of vantagepoint data and identify the common or unique items in the lists with timesliced data sets this can help you identify new or emerging concepts authors institutions or countries using group using thesaurus you can apply a thesaurus to your list and create groups of list items find and group searches the list for your target text and adds matching items to a group find provides for three search strings and several boolean operators for example and adjacent near or etc … and no you are not limited to viewing  at a time cooccurrence matrices  using a cooccurrence matrix you can spread a list across any other list for example using a cooccurrence matrix of author and year of publication you can see an authors publication trend over time and browse their publications by year this way you can see which authors have been working in an area for the longest time as well as whether they are still active   data from lists and cooccurrence matrices can be easily exported to other applications for visualization or customized analysis this example shows a threedimensional column chart created using vantagepoint data in microsoft excel—simply select a portion of the cooccurrence matrix copy it to the clipboard and paste into excel this example is created from a cooccurrence matrix of publication sourcebyyear it shows the relative publication trends in the different research communities the research communities are created in a list—group using thesaurus—and the cooccurrence matrix is created using the groups these data are also exported directly from vantagepoint and plotted in microsoft excel mapsnetworks  beyond onedimensional lists and twodimensional cooccurrence matrices analyses vantagepoint performs multidimensional statistical analysis to identify clusters and relationships among concepts people organizations and countries this example shows an autocorrelation map each node represents one person in this example inventors associated with a particular organization in a patent dataset proximity of people and links between people show the strength of relationship correlation based on cooccurrence of their names in the same records eg patents some teams can be readily seen and one individual that is related to everyone else this example shows a factor map of descriptors index terms in a dataset each node may represent several descriptors that are combined based on how frequently they occur together proximity and links show higher correlation among terms from the map the user can browse the underlying text for each node data cleaning  vantagepoint uses fuzzy matching techniques to identify associate and clean up data for example it will handle misspellings alternative hyphenation and capitalization and differing conventions for listing the names of people and companies providing you with higherquality data that is essential for good analysis the data cleaning tools can be applied to any field and vantagepoint can automatically check the fuzzy matches by looking at a complementary field—for example when matching inventor names also requiring the assignee to match after vantagepoints automatic cleanup the cleanup confirm window gives you a powerful toolset and full control of the results the detail windows let you interactively validate the cleanup suggestions user managed thesauri  with vantagepoint you can create edit and apply thesauri which can be used for specialized data reduction or conversion using a thesaurus you can easily combine all variants of a data element for example united states us us usa etc for other types of analysis you can combine data elements into broad categories for example aluminum alloys magnesium alloys carbon fiber reinforced plastics and copper alloys into materials or usa canada and mexico into north america you can also use a thesaurus to transform classification codes or index terms into something more easily understood vantagepoints thesaurus editor provides several interactive tools for creating editing testing and managing your thesauri vantagepoints thesauri support both normal text and regular expressions for matching data in the source list scripting you can automate sequences of actions using vantagepoints extensions to microsofts vbscript create and distribute scripts and make your customized analysis techniques and processes easily repeatable   vantagepoint adds eight vb objects and over  vb methods to vbscript   operating systems  vantagepoint works on windows   and  platforms vantagepoint has a bit version and a bit version  the bit version of vantagepoint requires the bit version of windows installation on windows server is not supported other operating systems eg macintosh os x or linux are not supported while not a requirement for running vantagepoint some of our visual basic scripts require microsoft excel  or later processor  intel i or better or similar nonmobile processors  the faster the processor the better the performance  vantagepoint will use multicore processors to improve performance of many operations  memory  the minimum recommended operating ram is  gb  with bit vantagepoint a minimum of  gb is recommended   the available physical ram has the biggest impact on vantagepoint performance  vantagepoint files can be quite large and it is much easier to work with them if they can be loaded into ram  if the operating system has to use virtual memory to load a file into vantagepoint performance will be slower on a bit windows operating system the bit version of vantagepoint can use up to gb of ram  on a bit windows operating system bit vantagepoint can use up to gb of ram the bit version of vantagepoint can use much more ram  the exact amount depends on the specific version of the operating system  for most professional versions of windows bit vantagepoint can use at least gb of ram  some versions of windows allow much more disk space  vantagepoint itself uses about mb of disk space this does not include the disk space needed for your data files which can be quite large  typically no less than mb records since vantagepoint files can be quite large a fast hard drive reduces the time required to load the file from storage to ram standard drive sizes are usually more than sufficient for vantagepoint file storage if you are planning to work with large files on a regular basis it is helpful to have two separate hard drives  one for the operating system and one for storage we have found that the windows operating system tends to severely fragment large files over time which slows down performance if the operating system is on the first drive and data is stored on the second drive then the files are less fragmented in theory partitioning a drive should work but we have found that a second drive performs better than a single drive with two partitions display
