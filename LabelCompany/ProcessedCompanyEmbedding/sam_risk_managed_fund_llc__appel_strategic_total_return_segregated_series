risks including market interest rate issuer credit inflation risk and liquidity risk the value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed investing in foreign denominated andor domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations and economic and political risks which may be enhanced in emerging

that a position could not be closed when most advantageous investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested diversification does not ensure against loss although the fund may seek to maintain stable distributions the fund’s distribution rates may be affected by numerous factors including but not limited to changes in realized and projected market returns fluctuations in market interest rates fund performance and other factors there can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in the fund’s distribution rate or that the rate will be sustainable in the future for instance during periods of low or declining interest rates the fund’s distributable income and dividend levels may decline for many reasons for example the fund may have to deploy uninvested assets whether from purchases of fund shares proceeds from matured traded or called debt obligations or other sources in new lower yielding instruments additionally payments from certain instruments that may be held by the fund such as variable and floating rate securities may be negatively impacted by declining interest rates which may also lead to a decline in the fund’s distributable income and dividend levels it is important to note that differences exist between the fund’s daily internal accounting records the fund’s financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and recordkeeping practices under income tax regulations it is possible that the fund may not issue a section  notice in situations where the fund’s financial statements prepared later and in accordance with us gaap or the final tax character of those distributions might later report that the sources of those distributions included capital gains andor a return of

pimcoadvised fund including those with a similar name investment objective or policies a new or smaller fund’s performance may not represent how the fund is expected to or may perform in the longterm new funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies a fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share
