undervalued compared to its industry average financial ratioswilliamssonoma inc has the potential to be both a value stock and a growth stock as the projected eps growth for next  years is by stavros georgiadis cfa bottomfishing is a very dangerous investing strategy but at the same time it can be a very profitable stockpicking strategy if the conditions for perfect timing are met a stock which has solid fundamentals attractive growth prospects and a nice dividend yield plus is trading at very low financial ratios compared to the average ratios of its industry and has underperformed the general stock market in the first semester of the year is very hard to ignore williamssonoma inc nysewsm stock has all the mentioned characteristics and on friday st july  its closing price of  was only  above its week low price of  while there are no guarantees that the stock cannot move lower the arguments in our analysis favor strongly the scenario of an upside potential and at current price levels the stock is a very lowrisk buying opportunity the company is one of the largest united states ecommerce retailers with a range of wellknown brands in home furnishings such as pottery barn williams sonoma west elm mark and graham rejuvenation having a global presence and a corporate strategy focused on ecommerce and online shopping the company focuses on continuous internet offerings on its products with incentives and discounts and can benefit from its online presence as global ecommerce is estimated to reach  trillion us dollar by  having a rapid growth one very important factor that can also help the sales of williamssonoma inc is the weak us dollar which makes the prices of its products cheaper on an international basis this can have a positive impact on the number of future revenues for the company the company offers worldwide shipping and it is forecast that about  million worldwide consumers or about  of online shoppers will purchase products online by the year of  these numbers show the potential growth of online shopping and williams sonoma inc follows a marketing and business strategy that takes well into consideration the global ecommerce growth in the future years and can benefit from it the stock has a series of positive eps surprises for the past  quarters with  positive surprises  flat or zero surprises and only  negative surprise the stock for a year period of fundamental analysis from st january of  to st january of  has a consistent increase in its eps both basic and diluted for all five years and the same trend applies as well to its dividend policy the company has increased its dividend on an annual basis for all the past  years of reference while the increase of basic eps for  was only  to  compared to the basic eps of  for the twelve month trailing period of january  to january  the year average eps growth for the month of january  is  the company is expected to have a  years eps growth of  this shows a potential for higher future growth which can have a positive impact on the profitability and the stock price the analysts are optimistic about the future economic outlook of the stock as out of  analysts  have a hold recommendation  has an outperform recommendation  has a buy recommendation and none has any underperform or sell recommendation source the company has a very strong balance sheet with zero debt good liquidity with a current ratio of  for  and a mixed efficiency in management as the receivables and the inventory turnover has declined in the year period of analysis from  but the fixed assets and the asset turnover have increased maybe the efficiency is the weakest sector or economic performance for the company as the cash conversion cycle has also increased during this year period meaning the company takes more time to convert inventories to cash the valuation for the stock shows that it is relatively undervalued compared to the average financial ratios of priceearnings pricesales pricebook value and pricecash flow price ratios company industry current pe   pricesales   pricebook value   price cash flow   source msn money another positive factor in favor of the valuation of the williamssonoma inc stock is the positive and rising trend in its free cash flow as in  there was an increase of about  compared the free cash flow reading in  the stock offers an attractive current dividend yield of  which can add to the future holding period return for the investors who will decide to buy the stock at current low price levels as a conclusion our investment thesis suggests that the stock is relatively undervalued and having underperformed the general stock market strong performance of the first semester of the year from a contrarian point of view the stock looks also to have increased odds of closing its underperformance gap compared to the year performance of major us indices such as the sp  and the dow jones the stock has a year performance at the closing date of friday st july  of  while the dow jones is up  and sp  is up  for the same period this underperformance gap is a very significant one to ignore but the stock has a current beta of  and is less volatile than the general stock market this makes the stock suitable for a defensive portfolio as the major us indices are now near their alltime high prices as the stock should present less volatility in the event of any severe selloff in the stock market the current macroeconomic conditions with a weak us dollar is an additional fundamental factor which can help the sales growth of the company in a global environment the company and its stock can be considered both a value and a moderate growth stock pick the fundamentals of the stock make the bottomfishing strategy in this case a lowrisk investing
