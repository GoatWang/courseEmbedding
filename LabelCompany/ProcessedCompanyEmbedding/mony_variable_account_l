the section  applicants propose the substitutions as part of a continued and overall business plan by each insurance company to make its contracts more attractive to existing contract owners participants or prospective purchasers as the case may be and more efficient to administer and oversee each insurance company represents that it has carefully reviewed its contracts and each investment option offered under its contracts with the goal of providing a superior choice of investment options  among the principal purposes of the substitutions the section  applicants assert that the removed portfolios generally have not attracted sufficient contract owner or participant interest to support maintaining them as separate investment options under the contracts particularly where they duplicate or substantially overlap with other investment options offered through the separate accounts as of december   the separate accounts had allocated approximately the following amounts to the removed and replacement portfolios start printed page  substitution number—removed portfolios in millionsreplacement portfolios in millions old mutual select value portfolio eqalliancebernstein

efficiencies in administering the contracts and potentially enable the insurance companies to offer a wider range of investment options in the future that would be more attractive to contract owners and participants in this connection the section  applicants note that the deletion of unpopular investment options would create additional capacity on their systems and platforms to offer new investment options  the section  applicants further assert that the substitutions also are designed and intended to simplify the prospectuses and related materials with respect to the contracts and the investment options available through the separate accounts in certain cases the insurance companies offer several investment alternatives that overlap one another by having similar investment objectives policies and risks the proposed substitutions would eliminate these overlapping investment alternatives the section  applicants believe that the deletion of overlapping investment options should not adversely affect contract owners and participants given that other similar investment options will remain available under the contracts and that the contracts will either offer the same number of investment options or in those cases where the number of investment options is being reduced continue to offer a significant number of alternative investment options currently expected to range in number from  to  after the substitutions versus  to  before the substitutions  in addition some contracts offer investment alternatives from multiple fund complexes each with its own prospectus and disclosure format which significantly increases the volume and complexity of information that is received by contract owners and participants the insurance companies believe that this situation may be confusing to contract owners and participants by substituting the replacement portfolios for the removed portfolios the respective insurance company anticipates that it would simplify the contract prospectuses and related materials provided to contract owners and participants and thereby reduce the potential for contract owner and participant confusion the section  applicants also assert that the substitutions will enable an insurance company to reduce certain costs that it incurs in administering the contracts by removing overlapping and unpopular portfolios and thereby allowing an insurance company to offer more competitively priced products in the future  the section  applicants note that contract owners and participants with subaccount balances invested in shares of the replacement portfolios will have the same or lower net operating expenses immediately after the substitutions in addition the insurance companies have agreed to impose certain expense limits on replacement portfolios to ensure that contract owners and participants on the substitution date incur the same or lower expense ratios for certain periods after the substitutions in addition many of the replacement portfolios are larger than their corresponding removed portfolios generally speaking larger funds tend to have lower expenses than comparable funds that are smaller this is because with a larger asset size fixed fund expenses are spread over a larger base lowering the expense ratios therefore as a result of certain substitutions various costs such as legal accounting printing and trustee fees will be spread over a larger base with each contract owner and participant bearing a smaller portion of the cost than would be the case if the replacement portfolios andor the trust as applicable were smaller in size larger funds also may have lower trading expenses potentially resulting in higher returns  the section  applicants also argue that certain of the proposed substitutions would replace an outside portfolio with a portfolio for which axa equitable serves as manager and thus would permit axa equitable start printed page under the multimanager order to appoint dismiss and replace advisers and amend advisory agreements as necessary to seek optimal performance from the portfolio and its portfolio managers notwithstanding the multimanager order with respect to the substitution involving the eqvan kampen real estate portfolio after the substitution date as defined herein the section  applicants agree not to change the adviser to the eqvan kampen real estate portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of either a the adviser change or b axa equitables continued ability to rely on the multimanager order even with respect to this substitution the section  applicants believe that the substitution would provide axa equitable as the investment manager of the trust with greater oversight capabilities with respect to portfolios offered through its contracts  moreover certain of the substitutions will replace an outside portfolio with a portfolio that is managed by axa equitable in this regard the relevant replacement portfolios generally are only available through the variable insurance and annuity products offered by axa equitable and its affiliates consequently the board of trustees of the relevant replacement portfolios has greater sensitivity to the needs of contract owners and participants the relevant substitutions also will provide axa equitable with more influence over the administrative aspects of the portfolios while providing contract owners and participants with the benefit of third party asset management influence is important because changes to removed portfolios can result in costly offcycle communications and mailings to contract owners and participants conversely for the relevant replacement portfolios axa equitable has greater influence over the pace and timing of such changes axa equitable believes that the relevant substitutions will enable it to exercise more influence over the management and administration of the portfolios thereby reducing costs and customer confusion the added influence will give axa equitable the ability to react more quickly to changes and problems it encounters in its oversight of the relevant replacement portfolios  the section  applicants also maintain that the substitutions will substitute shares of a replacement portfolio for shares of a removed portfolio which has very similar and in some cases substantially similar investment objectives investment policies and risks as those of the corresponding removed portfolio this fact is expected to simplify the process of explaining the substitutions to contract owners and participants including an explanation of the relevant differences in the policies of the replacement and removed portfolios and should facilitate their understanding of the effect of the substitutions

shareholder service administration or other service fees revenue sharing or other arrangements in connection with such assets the insurance companies also represent that the proposed substitutions and the selection of the relevant replacement portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to the insurance companies or their affiliates by the relevant replacement

single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without commission approval section c provides that “the commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title”  the section  applicants assert that the each proposed substitution involves a substitution of securities within the meaning of section c of the  act and therefore request an order from the commission pursuant to section c approving the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants state they have reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another eligible investment fund for one of the current investment funds offered as a funding option under the contracts both to protect themselves and their contract owners and participants in situations where either might be harmed or disadvantaged by events affecting the issuer of the securities held by a separate account and to preserve the opportunity to replace such shares in situations where a substitution could benefit the insurance companies and their respective contract owners and participants  the section  applicants also argue that each replacement portfolio and its corresponding removed portfolio have similar and in some cases substantially similar or identical investment objectives policies and risks in addition each proposed substitution retains for contract owners and participants the investment flexibility that is a central feature of the contracts the section  applicants assert that any impact on the investment programs of affected contract owners and participants including the appropriateness of the available investment options should therefore be negligible  the section  applicants further assert that the ultimate effect of the substitutions would be to remove overlapping and duplicative investment options and those investment options that have not attracted sufficient contract owner or participant interest to support maintaining them as investment options under the contracts the substitutions will permit the insurance companies to present information to their contract owners and participants in a simpler and more concise manner and it is anticipated that after the proposed substitutions contract owners and participants will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under their contracts  in addition the section  applicants also argue that in connection with each proposed substitution contract owners and participants with subaccount balances invested in a replacement portfolio will have the same or lower net operating expense ratios after the substitution in this regard each insurance company has agreed to impose certain expense limits as discussed above to ensure that contract owners and participants do not incur higher expenses as a result of a substitution either for a period of two years after the substitution or for the life of the contract as applicable  in addition to the foregoing the section  applicants generally submit that each proposed substitution meets the standards that the commission and its staff have applied to similar substitutions that the commission previously has approved the section  applicants also submit that the proposed substitutions are not of the type that section c was designed to prevent as the contracts provide each contract owner or participant with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer contract values and cash values into and among other investment options available to contract owners or participants under their contracts additionally the substitutions will not in any manner reduce the nature or quality of the start printed page available investment options in this regard the proposed substitutions retain for contract owners and participants the investment flexibility which is a central feature of the contracts  moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners and participants the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty other than with respect to implementing policies and procedures designed to prevent disruptive transfer and other market timing activity that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the supplement notifying contract owners and participants of the proposed substitutions which supplement has been delivered to contract owners and participants at least thirty  days before the substitutions and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the proposed substitutions the substitutions therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was designed to prevent  the section  applicants also note that the proposed substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a contract or participating in a group contract contract owners and participants select much more than a particular underlying fund in which to invest their contract values they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the section  applicants under the applicable contract as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the contract contract owners and participants also may have considered the insurance companys size financial condition and its reputation for service in selecting their contract these factors will not change as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will the annuity life or tax benefits afforded under the contracts held by any of the affected contract owners or participants  section a of the  act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the same persons acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application issue an order exempting any proposed transaction from the provisions of section a if i the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned ii the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and iii the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the section  applicants request an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from the provisions of section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the inkind transactions in connection with the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the consideration to be paid and received as described in the application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the inkind transactions will be effected at the respective net asset values of each of the relevant removed portfolios and each of the relevant replacement portfolios as determined in accordance with the procedures disclosed in the registration statement for the relevant investment company and as required by rule c under the  act the inkind transactions will not change the dollar value of any contract owners or participants investment in any of the separate accounts the value of any contract the accumulation value or other value credited to any contract or the death benefit payable under any contract after the proposed inkind transactions the value of a separate accounts investment in a replacement portfolio will equal the value of its investments in the corresponding removed portfolio together with the value of any preexisting investments in the replacement portfolio before the inkind transactions  the section  applicants state they will assure themselves that the inkind transactions will be in substantial compliance with the conditions of rule a under the  act the section  applicants will assure themselves that the investment companies will carry out the proposed inkind transactions in conformity with the conditions of rule a or as applicable a removed portfolios and a replacement portfolios normal valuation procedures as set forth in the relevant investment companys registration statement except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold will not be cash  the section  applicants also assert that the proposed inkind transactions do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned furthermore the section  applicants represent that the proposed inkind transactions will be consistent with the policies of the removed and corresponding replacement portfolios as recited in their respective current registration statements and that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act and do not present any conditions or abuses that the  act was designed to prevent conclusion for the reasons set forth in the
