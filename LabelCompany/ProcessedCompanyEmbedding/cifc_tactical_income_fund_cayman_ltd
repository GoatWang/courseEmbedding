challenging for the leveraged credit market since the end of the financial crisis commodity prices came under pressure over the summer and risk assets sold off starting in august the us high yield market was down  and the us corporate loan market recorded its first negative total return since  our balance sheet investments in cifcmanaged funds outperformed their respective benchmarks both the senior secured corporate loan fund and the tactical income fund produced positive returns visàvis losses in both the cs loan index and the lsta loan index the pronounced weakness in the clo market led to a decline in marktomarket valuation of our balance sheet clo investments consequently net investment income dropped to  million compared with  million in  excluding investment income we increased

started to cut our energy exposure in late august and early september of  and continue to be defensively positioned we remain underweight the sector with current exposure below  clo issuance has been slow during the course of the first two months of  forecasts from various banks expect market conditions to improve in the second half of the year we are well positioned to access the market once conditions become more compelling loan prepayment rates have slowed significantly we expect loan prepayment rates to remain lower until clo new issuance volumes return increasing the duration of our existing clo aum we are taking advantage of lower loan prices to build par in our  clos we expect the current investment opportunity to drive improved returns and with that potentially higher
