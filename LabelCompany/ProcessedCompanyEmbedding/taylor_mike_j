 he has been the deputy commissioner for foods at the united states food and drug administration fda contents  early career  us food and drug administration   united states department of agriculture   monsanto     center for risk management     fda   present  in everyday culture  references  external links early careeredit taylor received a ba degree in political science from davidson college and a law degree from the university of virginia in  after passing the bar examination he became a staff attorney for the food and drug administration where he was executive assistant to the fda commissioner from    taylor worked in private law practice at king  spalding one client of which was the biotechnology company monsanto he established and led the firms food and drug law practice in  he published an article entitled the de minimis interpretation of the delaney clause legal and policy rationale in the journal of the american college of toxicology now called the international journal of toxicology which he had previously presented in december  at a symposium on topics in risk analysis sponsored by international life sciences institute risk science institute society for risk analysis and brookings institution the paper was delivered and published during the midst of a debate and litigation over federal agencies interpretation of the delaney clause a part of a  federal law that prohibits any carcinogenic chemical from being added in any amount to food that is processed as analytical instrumentation increased in power and more agents were found to be carcinogenic at very low levels the agencies had developed a quantitative risk assessment approach to interpreting the delaney clause which stated that if a carcinogen was present at levels less than  in  parts ppm the risk of that carcinogen was de minimis and it could be allowed on the market in his article taylor presented arguments in favor of this approach advocates in favor of organic food have criticized taylor for taking this stance and have attributed the stance not to a good faith effort to reasonably regulate but to an alleged desire to benefit monsanto financially us food and drug administration edit on july   michael taylor left king  spalding for the fda accepting the newly created post of deputy commissioner for policy in  he signed a guidance that milk from cows treated with bgh did not have to be labeled as such his name is not on the fda’s may  guidance on genetically modified gm plant foods but he is said to have been a coauthor both documents are part of a regulatory framework developed since the mids under the reagan and bush administrations to ensure the publics safety and development of the fledgling biotechnology industry without overly burdensome regulation the guidance had three tenets  us policy would focus on the product of gm techniques not the process itself  only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated and  gm products are on a continuum with existing products and therefore existing statutes are sufficient to review the products these tenets were first described in the coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology published by the presidents domestic policy council working group on biotechnology through the office of science and technology policy in  the  guidance for example treats transferred genetic material and the intended expression product or products in food derived from gm crops as food additives subject to existing food additive regulation under which that material may be considered either generally recognized as safe gras or not gras initially at the producers determination if the food additive is not gras the producer is required to submit data proving that the food additive does not adulterate the food  in other words that the additive is not injurious to health with respect to gm food the fda retained its ability to take enforcement action any food it found to be adulterated which would make its producer subject to the full range of enforcement measures under the act including seizure injunction and criminal prosecution of those who fail to meet their statutory duty united states department of agriculture edit between  and  taylor moved to the united states department of agriculture usda where he was administrator of the food safety  inspection service during that term he implemented a sciencebased approach called hazard analysis and critical control points haccp to raising safety standards for meat and poultry production over the protests from industry which food safety advocates have called a truly heroic accomplishment in february  antibiotechnology activist jeremy rifkin charged that taylor had a conflict of interest with respect to the approval of rbst the fda replied that taylor had recused himself from all but the final stages of the review the washington post reported that on march  fda commissioner david a kessler sent rifkin a fourpage letter stating that none of the activities of mr taylor cited in your petition were in violation of any applicable law or regulation or were otherwise inappropriate i believe that mr taylors behavior adhered to all applicable ethical standards kessler said that taylor had not been intimately involved in monsantos efforts to obtain approval as rifkin charged and that he was involved in the fdas bst policy only in the final stages of review kessler attached a ninepage memo by fda ethics official jack m kress supporting that position upon arriving at the fda in the summer of  taylor recused himself for one year from taking part in any agency action dealing directly with monsanto or any other king and spalding clients it also reported that some longtime agency critics found the charges against taylor misplaced like sidney wolfe a physician who heads the public citizen health research group and has filed complaints with the fda about revolvingdoor ethics issues concerning other officials monsanto   edit between  and  after briefly returning to king  spalding taylor worked for monsanto as a vice president for public policy in  a lawsuit alliance for
