index was up  in the fourth quarter and  for the entire year not including dividends investors don’t like uncertainty it is said but november  removed that cloud as the election of donald trump put an individual in the white house who has promised many steps to help businesses and increase their profits a number of recent economic reports have also helped investor optimism while gross domestic product continues to show annual rates of increase of only  or less hours worked have been increasing while unemployment decreased to a  rate in the fourth quarter particularly encouraging was the department of labor report that the productivity of american workers rose  in the third quarter the fastest pace in two years while labor costs slowed after a large increase in the spring this improvement in productivity followed three quarterly declines and was the best increase since the one of  in the third quarter of  we have often noted the importance of this measure since increased productivity can lead not only to higher corporate profits but also to an improved standard of living while time will tell which items trump can accomplish from his lengthy todo list and at what pace it is clear that voter desire for change both here and elsewhere in the world has substantially altered the political landscape since barack obama took office eight years ago with his promise of change at the time the democrats have lost over  house seats  senate seats and over  governorships most recently the swing to republican control has continued even while obama’s approval rating moved up to its highest level in four years of greater interest to investors are the prospects for change in  we have entered the year with a strong but not dramatically growing economy with both domestic product and inflation increasing at annual rates of about  the federal reserve has instituted one small increase in interest rates but has also indicated the likelihood of several more in the current year if the economy continues to strengthen with concurrent inflationary pressures good economic momentum and improving productivity are the right ingredients for the growth of corporate earnings – and therefore are positive factors for stock market performance as well if the new administration is successful in scrapping some corporate regulations and reducing taxes earnings should benefit even more while current stock prices as measured by the popular averages are not cheap by historic standards neither are they wildly expensive thus given our outlook for the economy overall and for corporate earnings in particular we feel that a positive outlook for equities is in order though corrections can certainly be expected from time to time it is a particularly bad time we believe to chase stocks with high priceearnings multiples as they can be hit the hardest when corrections do occur our very best wishes for the new year connors investor services inc the money manager people tm
