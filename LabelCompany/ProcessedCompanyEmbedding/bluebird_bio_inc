immunotherapy a potentially transformative approach to treating cancer our initial focus in cancer immunotherapy is on delivering sustainable and effective t cell therapies to patients with cancer we are leveraging our core expertise in gene transfer technology and our experience in implementing gene therapy clinical trials to build a broad fully integrated immunooncology franchise for years the standard of care for treating cancer was surgery chemotherapy and radiation for a variety of cancers cancer immunotherapy based on car t cells presents a promising new treatment option our cancer immunotherapy research group is focused on the next generation of t cell engineering and creating a pipeline of t cell product candidates to treat a wide variety of liquid and solid tumor cancers car t program leveraging our gene therapy expertise to treat cancer our gene therapy technology can genetically modify a patient’s own t cells to target and destroy cancer cells in advanced clinical studies academic researchers have shown that modified t cells called chimeric antigen receptor or car t cells can provide a potentially curative option for patients with a variety of lymphomas blood tumors after other treatment approaches have failed like our programs for hematopoietic stem cells stem cells from the patient in rare genetic disorders our car t technology uses a customized lentiviral vector to alter t cells so the t cells can recognize specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells or other diseased cells and kill them with our car t technology we harvest a patient’s white blood cells a process called leukapheresis and activate certain t cells to grow the gene sequences for the car construct are transferred into the t cell dna using a lentiviral vector t cells are then grown to numbers sufficient for the desired patient dose these genetically engineered cells which will express the receptors that can recognize the exact proteins that are characteristic of specific cancers are then infused back into the patient the genetically engineered car t cells are designed to supplement a patient’s immune system and can be further engineered to overcome immune evasion mechanisms used by cancer cells our immunotherapy focus we currently have active clinical and preclinical research programs targeting multiple different novel oncology antigens including bcell maturation antigen bcma and the human papillomavirus type  e hpv e oncoprotein these programs include various t cell therapies with significant academic and industry collaborations our lead car t program bb in collaboration with celgene is being evaluated in a phase  clinical study crb for the treatment of relapsedrefractory multiple myeloma in february  we announced the first patient treated in the study at the th american society of hematology annual meeting in december  we announced the first preclinical data from our antibcma program including for bb in three poster presentations covering critical basic research translational and manufacturing aspects of our t cell oncology pipeline we presented the first interim data for bb at the th eortcnciaacr molecular targets and cancer therapeutics symposium in december  leveraging the best science through strategic partnerships × celgene we signed an agreement in march  which was then amended in june  to focus solely on developing product candidates targeting bcma during a threeyear term we are working collaboratively with celgene on the initial lead antibcma product candidate bb which is currently being studied in a phase  clinical trial crb in patients with relapsedrefractory multiple myeloma we are also collaborating with celgene to develop nextgeneration antibcma product candidates in february  celgene exercised its option to exclusively license bb and will be responsible for worldwide development and commercialization of bb after phase  we are responsible for the development of bb through the completion of the crb study and we have an option to share in the development promotion and profits in the united states × kite pharma we partnered with kite pharma to codevelop and cocommercialize second generation t cell receptor tcr product candidates directed against hpv e incorporating gene editing and lentiviral technologies × viromed our license agreement with viromed brings together viromed’s humanized antibody with our lentiviral gene therapy platform and car t capabilities to develop car t therapies against an undisclosed cancer target for solid tumors × lonza in june  we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with lonza houston inc providing for the future commercial production of our lentid™ and lentiglobin™ drug products × apceth biopharma × apceth biopharma in december  we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with apceth biopharma for the future european commercial production of our lentid™ product candidate for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy and our lentiglobin™ product candidate for transfusiondependent βthalassemia immune system and t cells we believe the use of human cells as therapeutic entities to reenergize the immune system will be the next significant advancement in the treatment of cancer these cellular therapies are designed to avoid the longterm side effects associated with current treatments and have the potential to be effective regardless of the previous treatments patients have experienced our car t cell technology based on our lentiviral vector technology and experience is designed with the intent to deliver a payload of potent t cells that can kill cancer cells specifically and directly learn more about cancer immunotherapy the immune system recognizes danger signals and responds to threats at a cellular level it is often described as having two arms the first is the innate immune system which recognizes nonspecific signals of infection or abnormalities as a first line of defense and creates the initial response the response is the same every time regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent the second arm is the adaptive immune system composed of highly specific targeted cells it provides longterm recognition and protection from infectious agents and abnormal processes such as cancer the adaptive immune response can be humoral antibodybased or cellular which includes t cellbased immune responses the most significant cellular components of the adaptive immune response are t cells so called because they typically mature in the thymus t cells are involved in sensing and killing infected or abnormal cells as well as coordinating the activation of other cells in an immune response these cells are classified into two major subsets cd t cells and cd t cells based on cell surface expression of the cd or cd glycoproteins both subsets of t cells have specific functions in mounting an immune response to clear an infection or eliminate cancerous cells cd t cells or helper t cells are involved in coordinating the immune response by enhancing the activation expansion migration and effector functions of other types of immune cells cd t cells or cytotoxic t cells can directly attack and kill cells they recognize as infected or otherwise abnormal and are aided by cd t cells both types of t cells are activated when their t cell receptor recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure on the surface of another cell this protein structure is composed of the major histocompatibility complex or mhc and a small protein fragment or peptide derived from proteins inside the cell or on the cell surface circulating cd and cd t cells survey the body differentiating between mhcpeptide structures containing “foreign” peptides and those containing “self” peptides a foreign peptide may signal the presence of an immune threat such as an infection or cancer causing the t cell to activate recruit other immune cells and eliminate the targeted cell although the immune system is designed to identify foreign or abnormal proteins expressed on tumor cells this process is either ineffective or defective in cancer patients the defective process sometimes occurs when cancer cells closely resemble healthy cells and go unnoticed or if tumors lose their mhc protein expression additionally cancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immune detection to suppress the effect of the immune response some tumors also encourage the production of regulatory t cells that block cytotoxic t cells that would normally attack the cancer this site

βthalassemia sickle cell disease medical professionals become a bluebird overview join the nest investors  media our focus severe diseases each person inherits features in the form of genes which are made up of a molecule called dna genetic diseases involve problems with the functioning genes our gene therapy technology intends to make up for genetic defects by creating a functioning copy of the genes that express functional proteins and correct or address the underlying cause of the disease we believe gene therapy has the potential to provide transformative diseasemodifying effects – potentially with lifelong clinical benefits based on a single administration leading the revolution – how our gene therapy works our gene therapy process works by genetically modifying a patient’s own cells by adding a functional copy of the gene of interest we have extensive expertise in viral vector design and manufacturing and transduction which we have developed into a potent gene therapy platform with potentially broad applications in a wide variety of indications with significant medical needs lentid adrenoleukodystrophy ald is a rare xlinked metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the abcd gene which result in a deficiency in adrenoleukodystrophy protein aldp and subsequent accumulation of very long chain fatty acids vlcfa vlcfa accumulation occurs in plasma and all tissue types but primarily affects the adrenal cortex and white matter of the brain and spinal cord leading to a range of clinical outcomes the most severe form of ald the inflammatory cerebral phenotype known as cerebral ald cald involves a progressive destruction of myelin the protective sheath of the nerve cells in the brain that are responsible for thinking and muscle control symptoms of cald usually occur in early childhood and progress rapidly if untreated leading to severe loss of neurological function and eventual death in most patients bluebird bio is developing the investigational gene therapy lentid drug product for the treatment of cald the phase  starbeam clinical study ald is assessing the efficacy and safety of lentid in boys up to  years of age with cald the study involves transplantation with a patient’s own stem cells which are modified to contain a functioning copy of the abcd gene this gene addition should result in the production of functional aldp a protein critical for the breakdown of vlcfas buildup of vlcfas in the central nervous system contributes to neurodegeneration in cald the primary efficacy endpoint for the starbeam clinical study ald is the proportion of patients who are alive and have none of six major functional disabilities mfds at  months post treatment mfds are the six most severe disabilities from the neurologic function score nfs and are of particular clinical importance because they severely compromise a patient’s ability to function independently they are loss of communication cortical blindness tube feeding total

product candidate aims to treat transfusiondependent βthalassemia also known as βthalassemia major and severe sickle cell disease scd lentiglobin works by inserting a functional human betaglobin gene into a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells outside the body ex vivo and then transplanting those modified cells into the patient’s blood stream through infusion also known as autologous stem cell transplantation a unique amino acid substitution in the betaglobin gene in lentiglobin confers important antisickling properties to help potentially address the most severe forms of sickle cell disease promising results from a preclinical proofofconcept study using gene therapy to treat sickle cell disease were published in science we currently have four ongoing studies evaluating our lentiglobin therapy for the treatment of transfusiondependent βthalassemia and severe scd – the northstar study in transfusiondependent βthalassemia the northstar study in patients with transfusiondependent βthalassemia and nonββ genotypes the hgb study in transfusiondependent βthalassemia or severe scd the hgb study in severe scd and the phase  hgb study in transfusiondependent βthalassemia and non β β genotypes as we continue to gather a growing body of data for lentiglobin we are learning and better understanding the potential clinical benefit our therapy can have on

focus gene editing gene editing the next frontier in gene therapy gene editing has generated a lot of excitement in academia and drug development its promise is twofold the unique ability to correct genetic mutations that may cause disease and its utility in creating and controlling genetic information within patient cells emerging science suggests that permanently fixing or “editing” mutated cells or creating safer and more potent cellbased products with this technology could provide curative onetime treatments for patients suffering from a broad range of diseases in june  we acquired precision genome engineering inc or pregenen a company with a sophisticated advanced gene editing technology platform and research team our integrated teams are expanding our discovery research efforts in this emerging field we are testing homing endonuclease and megatal gene editing technologies in a variety of potential applications and disease areas including hematology and oncology reprogrammed homing endonucleases and megatals are novel enzymes that provide a highly specific and efficient way to potentially treat a variety of diseases by silencing editing or inserting genetic components into a cell structural depiction of a homing endonuclease bound to its dna target homing endonucleases are compact proteins able to wrap around and effectively ‘saddle’ dna when they identify a dna sequence that fits into their pattern of amino acid chemistries they are able to cleave that dna sequence such dna recognition chemistries can be reprogrammed by our protein engineers to operate on dna target sequences of our choosing homing endonucleases can be paired with tal arrays – modular and therefore easily reprogrammable dna recognition components – creating hybrid “megatal” proteins with advanced dna recognition characteristics megatals are the most efficient genome editing ‘machines’ yet devised landing at and modifying their target sites with extreme precision and efficiency why megatals and homing endonucleases all the gene editing technologies currently being explored by the pharmaceutical industry including zinc finger nucleases crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatscas crispr associated protein  and talens transcription activatorlike effector nucleases share dna recognition and dna cutting functions they all differ in specificity size ease of delivery and the detailed biochemistry that underlies their dna recognition cleavage and repair mechanisms homing endonucleases are the only monomeric naturally occurring proteins to bind and cleave dna in a highly sequenced specific fashion megatals are fusion proteins that combine homing endonucleases with the modular dna binding domains of talens resulting in improved dna sequence targeting and unparalleled gene editing efficiencies since these hybrid nucleases still cut dna using homing endonuclease cleavage biochemistry they engage dna repair pathways in a manner distinct from all other gene editing nucleases the compact format and ultraefficient nature of our nucleases make them powerful tools in our ongoing effort to build advanced gene editing processes and products for a broad range of therapeutic applications multiple advantages of homing endonucleases and megatals naturally occurring geneediting proteinshighly specific and efficient activitycompact size allows for delivery of multiple proteins broad range of therapeutic applications complimentary to existing indications putting gene editing to work in collaboration with leading academic institutions we are using our gene editing platform to potentially discover and develop new more advanced versions of our current ex vivo gene therapy product candidates and to explore expansions into new disease indications our car t cell technology also brings gene editing tools to the immunotherapy field our homing endonuclease and megatal technology offer a number of additional options to manipulate the gene of a cancer patient’s t cells in hopes of further increasing the specificity of antitumor activity and potentially make them more potent specificity and potency are
