in patients with schizophrenia study ‘ intracellular therapies to host a conference call today at  pm et to discuss results new york sept   globe newswire  intracellular therapies inc nasdaqitci today announced topline results from the second phase  clinical trial study ‘ of iti an oral firstinclass investigational medicine for the treatment of schizophrenia in this trial neither dose of iti separated from placebo on the primary endpoint change from baseline on the positive and negative syndrome scale panss total score in the predefined patient population the active control risperidone did separate from placebo  in this trial iti was statistically significantly better than risperidone on key safety and tolerability parameters and exhibited a safety profile similar to placebo  this replicates the safety and tolerability findings of a previous study our phase  study ‘ in which the efficacy of iti  mg and risperidone the active control were similar we believe iti did not separate from placebo on the prespecified primary endpoint in study ‘ in part due to an unusually high placebo response at certain sites which disproportionately affected the trial results and contributed to the efficacy outcome of this study compared to our two previous positive efficacy studies drug development in psychiatry faces numerous challenges and approved antipsychotics have had negative results as part of their clinical development programs we are committed and adequately resourced to continue the development of iti for the treatment of schizophrenia we believe the iti latestage clinical development program including two large wellcontrolled positive studies and supportive evidence from this study ‘ collectively provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of iti for the treatment of schizophrenia across all three of our efficacy trials iti  mg improved symptoms of schizophrenia with the same magnitude of change from baseline in the primary endpoint the panss total score we plan to request a meeting with the us food and drug administrations fda division of psychiatry products to discuss the regulatory path for this firstinclass investigational agent it is not uncommon in the field of psychiatry for studies to be challenged by high placebo response and there has been great variability in the effects observed from one study to the next said christoph corell md professor of psychiatry at hofstra northwell school of medicine taken together the iti schizophrenia program supports iti as a unique medication with an unprecedented safety and tolerability profile moreover efficacy has been demonstrated in two largescale schizophrenia studies to date in one of these studies iti and risperidone the active control had similar efficacy in light of the results to date i believe that iti represents a unique investigational medication which has the potential to advance the treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia in this study consistent with our previous schizophrenia studies iti was welltolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo there were no clinically significant differences with iti from placebo in akathisia extrapyramidal symptoms prolactin body weight glucose insulin and lipids as expected risperidone demonstrated a statistically significant increase in weight gain glucose cholesterol triglycerides and prolactin compared to placebo these increases have a negative impact on patients in contrast iti was statistically significantly better than risperidone on all of these tolerability parameters there were no significant increases observed with iti versus placebo on any of these parameters there continues to be a need for safer and more tolerable medications for patients with schizophrenia which are not associated with the motoric and cardiometabolic side effects of many existing treatments thereby potentially improving compliance and reducing relapse and hospitalizations we believe iti has the potential to address this need based on the strength of the clinical data generated in this program to date including two positive studies supportive evidence from study ‘ and a consistent welltolerated and placebolike safety profile across all studies we continue to believe iti will be an important treatment for patients suffering from schizophrenia we remain committed to the development of iti for the treatment of schizophrenia bipolar depression agitation associated with dementia including alzheimers disease and other neuropsychiatric indications  said dr sharon mates chairman and ceo of itci   about the iti schizophrenia program the iti clinical program in schizophrenia includes three randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled trials the phase  trial study ‘ was positive and was completed in  with  patients  the first phase  trial study ‘ was positive and was completed in september  with  patients today we are reporting topline results from our second phase  trial study ‘ with  patients about the iti trial this randomized doubleblind fixeddose placebo and activecontrolled inpatient clinical trial was conducted at  sites in the united states consisting of  patients randomized  to receive iti  or  mg risperidone  mg as the active control or placebo once daily in the morning for six weeks risperidone required a dose titration from  mg to  mg while no dose titration was required for iti patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia using dsm criteria and were required to have an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms the prespecified primary efficacy measure was change from baseline versus placebo at study endpoint  weeks on the centrally rated panss total score  the panss is a wellvalidated item rating scale that measures the ability of a drug to reduce schizophrenia symptom severity in this study approximately  of patients on placebo completed treatment compared to approximately  with  mg  with  mg and only  for risperidone iti  mg and  mg demonstrated a change from baseline on the panss total score of  points and  points respectively versus a  point change in placebo risperidone the active control demonstrated a change from baseline on the panss total score of  points in the context of the iti development program iti  mg improved symptoms of schizophrenia with the same magnitude of change from baseline on the panss total score across all three studies  points in study ‘  points in study ‘ as compared with  points at week  and  points at week  in study ‘ the magnitude of change for iti  mg was similar to the active control risperidone  points in study ‘ the trajectory of improvement with iti  mg was similar across all three studies an unusually high placebo response was observed in this study compared with previous studies    point change from baseline on panss total score in study ‘ in contrast to  points in study ‘ and  points in study ‘ conference call and webcast details intracellular therapies will host a live conference call and

a disabling and chronic mental illness affecting over  of the worlds population schizophrenia is characterized by multiple symptoms during an acute phase of the disorder that can include socalled positive symptoms such as hearing voices grandiose beliefs and suspiciousness or paranoia these symptoms can be accompanied by additional hardertotreat symptoms such as social withdrawal blunted emotional response and speech deficits collectively referred to as negative symptoms difficulty concentrating and disorganized thoughts or cognitive impairment depression and insomnia such residual symptoms often persist even after the acute positive symptoms subside and contribute substantially to the social and employment disability associated with schizophrenia current antipsychotic medications provide some relief for the symptoms associated with the acute phase of the disorder but they do not effectively treat the residual phase symptoms associated with chronic schizophrenia currently available medications used to treat acute schizophrenia are limited in their use due to side effects that can include movement disorders weight gain metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disorders there is an unmet medical need for new therapies about iti iti is our lead drug development candidate with mechanisms of action that we believe have the potential to yield a firstinclass therapy for multiple therapeutic indications in our preclinical and clinical trials to date iti combines potent serotonin hta receptor antagonism dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulation dppm glutamatergic modulation and serotonin reuptake inhibition into a single drug candidate for the treatment of acute and residual schizophrenia as well as for the treatment of bipolar disorder including bipolar depression and the treatment of agitation associated with dementia including alzheimers disease at dopamine d receptors iti has been demonstrated to have dual properties and to act as both a postsynaptic antagonist and a presynaptic partial agonist iti has also been demonstrated to have affinity for dopamine d receptors and indirectly stimulate phosphorylation of glutamatergic nmda glunb receptors in a mesolimbic specific manner  we believe that this regional selectivity in brain areas thought to mediate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs together with serotonergic glutamatergic and dopaminergic interactions may result in efficacy for a broad array of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with improved psychosocial function the serotonin reuptake inhibition potentially allows for antidepressant activity in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder comorbid depression andor as a standalone treatment for major depressive disorder we believe iti may also be useful for the treatment of other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders particularly behavioral disturbances associated with dementia autism and other cns diseases about intracellular therapies
