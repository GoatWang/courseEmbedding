timberg by brian fung and craig timberg june  follow bfung follow craigtimberg since the beginning of  uber has seen nonstop controversies from deleteuber to accusations of technology theft here are all the controversies in one place daron taylorjhaan elkerthe washington post this story has been updated billionaire businessman david bonderman a member of uber’s board resigned tuesday after making what he called an “inappropriate” comment about women at a companywide meeting that was aimed at addressing the harassment of women and other unprofessional conduct within the company the comment came as an interruption of fellow board member arianna huffington who was explaining the benefits of having more female representation on ubers board “there’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board” said huffington according to several people who heard the remarks “actually” bonderman interjected “what it shows is it’s much likely therell be more talking” “oh come on david” huffington said in between awkward laughs addressing the crowd she added “dont worry david will have a lot of talking to do as well” in an email that was sent later to company employees bonderman said “i want to apologize to my fellow board member for a disrespectful comment” calling it “inappropriate” bonderman the yearold cofounder of a private equity firm also apologized personally to huffington “david has apologized to all uber employees for a remark that was totally inappropriate and against the new culture we are building at uber” huffington said in a statement uber board member david bonderman shown in  andrew harrerbloomberg news a few hours later bonderman resigned and released this statement “uber is examining the issues with its culture and making significant changes and working to right what has been done wrong which is extremely important for the future of the company i do not want my comments to create distraction as uber works to build a culture of which we can be proud i need to hold myself to the same standards that we’re asking uber to adopt huffington also issued a statement praising bonderman for his decision “i appreciate david doing the right thing for uber at this time of critical cultural changes at the company” the incident came as uber sought to move past a leadership crisis that has led to the departure this week of chief executive travis kalanick for a leave of absence and the exit of his close ally and confidant emil michael a senior vice president at uber kalanicks return date was not specified and his responsibilities will undergo “review” to possibly shift some duties to other executives he also faces the likelihood of reduced clout on the board which is adding new “independent” members and creating an oversight committee to monitor efforts to improve corporate ethics and diversity “the ultimate responsibility for where we’ve gotten and how we’ve gotten here rests on my shoulders” kalanick wrote in an email to employees “there is of course much to be proud of but there is much to improve for uber  to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team but if we are going to work on uber  i also need to work on travis  to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve” in describing reasons for the leave kalanick also cited the death of his mother and serious injury of his father in a boating accident last month saying “i need to take some time off of the daytoday to grieve my mother whom i buried on friday to reflect to work on myself and to focus on building out a worldclass leadership team” tuesday marked the release of recommendations from a report by former us attorney general eric h holder jr on ubers workplace culture holder had been hired by uber to address mounting criticism of the company the full report is being withheld from the public and the bulk of the companys  employees worldwide the  recommendations which are sweeping and touch virtually every aspect of company management were released at an employee meeting at the companys san francisco headquarters tuesday after being accepted by the board at a marathon meeting sunday under the proposals senior managers will undergo mandatory leadership training and uber’s current position of head of diversity will be renamed as the “chief diversity and inclusion officer” and report directly to the chief executive or chief operating officer uber also will adopt the equivalent of the national football leagues “rooney rule” requiring that when the company is filling a key job at least one woman and one minority candidate be interviewed before the hire can go forward the report called for employee complaints to be handled using a comprehensive process and for upgrades to employee benefits including equal family leave time for male and female workers there also is a newly imposed ban on sexual relationships between employees at different levels of the staff hierarchy and there are new limits on the consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs during the workday and at company events uber also announced monday that it was adding a new member nestle executive wan ling martello to one of several empty seats on the board she is expected to bring financial expertise while representing another highprofile female addition to a company criticized as exemplifying silicon valleys maledominated “bro” culture “this is a hugely significant event” said michael useem a management professor at the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania said of the corporate overhaul the list of recommendations reads like a textbook from “leadership and management ” and if implemented effectively could serve as a model for other silicon valley companies grappling with diversity and harassment issues useem said the public mood toward uber began to turn when kalanick joined an advisory board for president trump and appeared to undermine a new york taxi strike related to the president’s controversial effort to impose a travel ban sparking the deleteuber movement a scathing blog post in february by former engineer susan fowler who reported that an unwanted sexual advance by her boss was ignored by company management triggered a wave of denunciations of the

june   at  pm the addition of bonderman and bruckheimer provides the strongest signal yet that the oak view group intends to bring an nhl team to seattle nearterm and an nba team further down the road share story by geoff baker and daniel beekman seattle times staff reporter a modern keyarena under a historic roof more bigtime concerts and at least one new sports team — more likely a hockey club before a reincarnation of the sonics that’s what mayor ed murray and a collection of sports and entertainment executives on wednesday said seattleites can expect as murray officially announced oak view group ovg as his administration’s preferred choice to renovate keyarena introducing hollywood film and tv producer jerry bruckheimer and billionaire investment banker david bonderman as partners in the project ovg said it intends to pursue an nhl team in the short term and an nba team down the road “we’re going to get you a team” said tim leiweke ovg’s ceo “mark it right here i promise you … we’re going to get you at least one team” most read storiesforeign buyers drop off as seattle housing market hits hottest tempo since  bubblewhat drivers can and cannot do under washington states new

washington residents gather  deer elk in laws first year  viewunlimited digital access  for  weekssigning a letter with the yearold seattle center venue as a backdrop murray and leiweke agreed to negotiate a memorandum of understanding mou — and dealt a blow to a rival arena project pitched for the sodo district by entrepreneur chris hansen the mou with ovg would go to the seattle city council for approval the mayor said his goal is to complete the keyarena deal before he leaves office at the end of the year and described it as integral to a grand vision for seattle center built for the  world’s fair the aging civic campus is now wedged between a dense downtown queen anne and a booming techbusiness hub in south lake union “it’s now time to seize this historic moment of growth and innovation in seattle to build an arena for the st century” murray said “this is one part one piece of a larger plan that is already in place to make seattle center an international icon district on par with chicago’s millennium park” and cultural areas in hong kong and montreal ovg’s  million proposal — one of two bids submitted in april — includes a partnership with major concert company live nation and would involve building “an entirely new area” under the venue’s existing roof which is expected to be given historical landmark status joined on stage by former sonics player and coach lenny wilkens a member of a city advisory panel murray said ovg’s bid was preferable to a bid by seattle partners partly because it had the “best design” additionally “i chose the proposal that had the best financial plan” the mayor said “the plan is privately financed and does not require any of the city’s bonding authority” though it was seattle partners that requested  million in public bonding ovg is seeking a minimum of  million in city taxes and revenues from the renovated arena “that’s something we will work out with them to get the city the best deal possible” murray told reporters the mayor said outstanding challenges such as how a renovated arena would impact transportation in a crowded neighborhood could still derail the deal light rail is coming to the seattle center neighborhood but not until  according to sound transit’s projections nicole grant executive secretarytreasurer of the martin luther king county labor council praised the ovg plan saying union workers are ready to make the renovations and serve keyarena patrons melinda giovengo president of youthcare said the proposal includes funding and potential job training for young people experiencing homelessness and wilkens said “if ever there was a chance for the sonics to come back it’s this opportunity here” but murray and leiweke were careful to downplay the possibility of men’s pro basketball returning to seattle anytime soon they said the nba isn’t close to adding teams vancouver bc canucks owner francesco aquilini was on hand wednesday lending support to the prospect of a vancouverseattle hockey rivalry “we are already hard at work pursuing every opportunity” leiweke said “if the nhl so chooses to expand we will be all over them if there is a team that they choose to move we will be all over them if the nba and they’re not there yet but should they at some point in the future begin to talk about expansion we’ll be the first ones at the table” as for hansen’s proposal that remains in the hands of the city council and is “technically still alive” murray said but the mayor favors keyarena and leiweke made hansen a very public offer wednesday as the news cameras rolled “if chris hansen wants to join us in the nba we would like him to be a part owner of the nba team” leiweke said adding that he hadn’t spoken with the entrepreneur recently “so chris if you want an nba team this is where it’s going to happen” a hansen spokesman declined to comment but hansen spoke at a civic cocktail event wednesday night in seattle according to tweets by the associated press’ tim booth hansen said he would not sue the city for engaging with ovg while he has an mou adding “i’m in for what’s best for seattle also according to a tweet by booth hansen was complimentary toward leiweke but said of the seattle center site “is this where seattle wants an arena for next  years”     bonderman has been a minority owner of the boston celtics nba team for more than a decade and bruckheimer is a close acquaintance of nhl commissioner gary bettman and has long expressed a desire to become a franchise owner     the nba is believed to be five to  years from expansion but the nhl which will launch a new las vegas franchise this fall has an imbalance between its eastern and western conferences and could even things out by adding a seattle franchise bonderman  is a university of washington graduate and a longtime friend of mariners owner john stanton he is the chairman of buyout firm tpg capital and is listed by forbes as having a net worth of  billion representatives of the mariners seahawks and sounders attended wednesday’s news conference bruckheimer  had an estimated net worth of  million according to forbes in  he has produced blockbuster films such as “top gun” “beverly hills cop” “flashdance” and “pirates of the caribbean” he was described a decade ago in hollywood’s deadline magazine as the nhl’s “ultimate mr showbiz’’ given his “ice hockey obsession” and longstanding desire to own a franchise this isn’t the first time bonderman and bruckheimer have teamed on a sports venture in  bonderman was an “equal partner” in a bid group formed by frontman bruckheimer and mgm studios chairman harry evans sloan that looked into bringing an nhl expansion franchise to las vegas the group bowed out in  citing the economic recession that devastated the las vegas realestate market bruckheimer also looked into buying the pittsburgh penguins in  before a group led by mario lemieux purchased the team out of bankruptcy protection and kept it in place but bruckheimer has remained close with top nhl leadership including bettman frequently appearing at celebrity events at the allstar game and throughout the year bettman told the las vegas reviewjournal in  that he considers bruckheimer a good friend and thinks he would make a terrific league owner documents released by the city of seattle on wednesday show that an executivereview team and other advisers were impressed by ovg’s financial capacity even before bonderman and bruckheimer were brought aboard in an interview before wednesday’s event murray predicted the new additions would net seattle an nhl team before an nba team “i believe the nba has been pretty clear that their owners have a pretty good tv contract that financially they don’t want to break up at this point” he said eventually the mayor added “i think both of them will be here” murray said the city’s focus moving ahead will be on better integrating the ovg proposal within the surrounding neighborhood and ironing out certain financial details — such as parking revenue and tax requests — to better protect taxpayers   he said stakeholder opposition from other pro teams in sodo likely would make it difficult for the council to approve advancing hansen’s project unless a binding eventscheduling deal can be obtained the port of seattle also has been outspoken in opposing the sodo project citing traffic and freightmobility concerns “it is a proposal where there is significant opposition from some of the other neighbors down there” murray said “and it has to be worked out’’ bonderman would have to divest his celtics shares were he to become an nba owner at keyarena for now he will focus on getting the keyarena rebuild going and helping bring the nhl here first

second woman on the board” huffington said according to a person who heard the exchange but was not authorized to discuss it “actually what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking” bonderman said among the uber employees in the room there were audible gasps and blank stares according to another person at the meetinguber and tpg confirmed the resignation of bonderman  who founded tpg in  with jim coulter and has served as its chairman since  he’s also on the board of real estate firm cushman  wakefield inc kite pharma inc ryanair holdings plc and almost  other companiesthe billionaire couldn’t have picked a worse setting to interrupt a woman with a comment about how women talk he huffington and other executives were addressing employees to assure them that uber would be implementing a litany of recommendations from an independent investigation led by former us attorney general eric holder the entire process was sparked by a february blog post from former uber engineer susan fowler who detailed allegations of sexism and sexual harassment at the company uber chief executive officer travis kalanick said tuesday he will take a leave of absence and former senior vice president for business emil michael was ousted“today at uber’s allhands meeting i directed a comment to my colleague and friend arianna huffington that was careless inappropriate and inexcusable” bonderman wrote in an emailed statement “the comment came across in a way that was the opposite of what i intended but i understand the destructive effect it had and i take full responsibility for that”after the meeting bonderman apologized personally to huffington according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak about it the huffington post founder said in a statement later that her fellow director was “doing the right thing” “i do not want my comments to create distraction as uber works to build a culture of which we can be proud” bonderman said in his statement “uber is examining the issues with its culture and making significant changes and working to right what has been done wrong which is extremely important for the future of the company” before its here its on the bloomberg terminal learn more most read bankers ditch fat salaries to chase digital currency riches thursday is the ‘day from hell’ for europe’s stock watchers

quit the board of uber after saying at a company meeting that having more women on a board meant more talking arianna huffington uber board member laughed awkwardly at david bonderman’s sexist joke at a company meeting previous image next image         david bonderman founder of private equity group tpg has quit the board of uber after making a sexist joke at a company meeting adding to the turmoil at the top of the company after chief executive travis kalanick took a leave of absence mr bonderman is also chairman of ryanair’s board uber is trying to overhaul a corporate culture known for being aggressive and sexist and drafted in former us attorneygeneral eric holder to report on the ridehailing company’s failings and recommend changes but at a companywide meeting on tuesday to discuss the report’s proposals it took less than seven minutes before mr bonderman  interrupted fellow board member arianna huffington as ms huffington was telling staff that research showed boards with one female director were more likely to appoint a second mr bonderman interjected “actually what it shows is that it’s much more likely to be more talking” ms huffington laughed awkwardly and said it would be his turn to talk soon after the meeting mr bonderman emailed uber employees to apologise – and later announced he was resigning from the board standards “i need to hold myself to the same standards that we’re asking uber to adopt” he said in a statement “i do not want my comments to create distraction” the incident underscores the uphill battle uber faces as it seeks a cultural reboot following a series of crises ranging from allegations of sexual harassment to a lawsuit over selfdriving tech to revelations about greyball software it used to mislead regulators it has been a dramatic fall from grace for a company that is still silicon valley’s most successful startup with a recordsetting  billion valuation uber executives and board members on tuesday vowed to set the company on a track that would restore its image “we are in a reputational deficit” admitted board member bill gurley “it is going to take us a while to get out of this” the tricks uber uses to win at the expense of its drivers uber to shut down its business in denmark uber removes fleet of selfdriving cars after arizona crash ms huffington struck a slightly more optimistic note “today is the end of this investigation and the end of this process and the beginning of building an uber that puts people first” she said the process of rethinking governance and culture began just as mr kalanick  announced an indefinite leave of absence – leaving a leaderless group of  senior executives in charge the report’s top recommendation was to reduce mr kalanick’s responsibilities and hire a chief operating officer a role uber has been trying to fill since march the prospect of  drivers taking the wheel has raised concerns among shareholders that the arrangement will perpetuate the management chaos sparked by the departures of many top executives “the value destruction continues” complained one shareholder “management by a committee of grossly unprepared executives is a recipe for disaster” part of the problem is the ambiguity of mr kalanick’s role as a major shareholder and chief executive since uber’s early days he plans to remain involved in key strategic decisions and leadership appointments departure however his departure also presents an opportunity for an incoming chief operating officer and new board chairman to play a much bigger role in reshaping the company the chief operating officer search was launched in march after mr kalanick said he needed leadership help – an admission prompted by an embarrassing video of him yelling at an uber driver but with mr kalanick now on leave the chief operating officer search has turned into something more like a chief executive search the recent executive departures have all but wiped clean the slate of uber’s earliest employees particularly the exit of emil michael a close confidante of mr kalanick’s who was ousted on monday the company is currently looking to fill the roles of chief financial officer chief marketing officer head of engineering and general counsel uber’s board hopes the new hires will set a new tone “this company has been run as if it was a small startup” said mr bonderman to employees “but now it is not it has to have training programmes it has to have appropriate oversight” lack of oversight and poor governance was a key theme running through the findings of the report by mr holder and his colleague tammy albarran their  recommendations reveal gaping holes in uber’s governance structures and human resources practices uber now is preparing to appoint an independent board chairman establish a performance review system for leaders and change its cultural values it will also adopt a zerotolerance policy for substantiated complaints of discrimination and harassment – an indirect admission that previously such complaints had been ignored many of the recommendations seem obvious from goals and performance reviews to rules on alcohol consumption at work and a ban on sex with colleagues in a directreport relationship “the spoiled brats of silicon valley don’t know the basics” said vivek wadwha a fellow at the rock centre of corporate governance and the coauthor of innovating women “it is a revelation for silicon valley ‘duh you have to have hr people you can’t sleep with each other    you have to be respectful’” corporate culture the corporate culture under mr kalanick was marked by a willingness to skirt boundaries and ignore rules an approach that helped fuel uber’s rapid initial growth but has subsequently backfired “this is a company where there has been no line that you wouldn’t cross if it got in the way of success” said hadi partovi an uber investor and tech entrepreneur the impact of that culture and lack of oversight was highlighted last week when an investigation into more than  complaints of harassment and inappropriate behaviour resulted in the firing of  employees while many silicon valley startups experience growing pains few have been quite as public as uber’s as uber sets out to try to incorporate the basic tenets of corporate governance a key question will be whether mr kalanick can really keep his hands off of the startup he spent the last eight years building in an email to employees he said he would take time “to reflect to work on myself and to focus on building out a worldclass leadership team” if all goes as planned when he does come back it will be to a company that is radically different and where he will play a very different role –  copyright the financial times limited        topics arianna

billionaires their activities are often privatewildcat capital which owns  million shares or  percent of sorrento took that rare step on friday calling out “egregious” actions undertaken by sorrento’s

vertreten gb war beleidigt weil deutschland nicht auch für vauxhall gerade stehen wollte  sprich zahlen wollte das einzige entgegenkommen der usa gegenüber deutschland besser gegenüber frau merkel besteht wohl darin dass man die karten erst nach den btwahlen auf den tisch legen wird man will ja den wahlsieg von frau merkel nicht unnötig gefährden kleinrentner   natürlich zu frühe festlegung was

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
