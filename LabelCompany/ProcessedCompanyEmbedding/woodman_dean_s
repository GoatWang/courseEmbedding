skip to search form qbxxectbusuywax skip to navigation skip to page content yelp find near cancel search sign up log in login sign up about me talk restaurants nightlife home services write a review events talk log in     broadwaymillbrae ca    this is my go to place to buy fresh produce i get their double happiness oranges whenever theyre in stock they carry all the specialty items i love to use in my cooking including thyme basil sage san marzano tomatoes different blends of olive oils anchovies capers and dececco pasta good selection of pears and berries too everything is reasonably priced and in a good location its near restaurants coffee banks and the post office you can pick up some groceries while running other errands so im going to update this review based on what i can come up with this is in regards to a fraudulent charge that i got on my cc i have a specific credit card that i used to churn mileage points on this credit card only gets used at supermarkets and no online shopping at all i only shop in millbrae and visit  places on regular basis deans produce is the only place that takes credit card but only by the swiping option they put a sign that says swipe only no chips of the other places that i use this card all of them use chip as part of the industry standard everyone is required by law to take chip cards by using the emv chip reader and we have not heard of any hackers being able to duplicate emv chips only by reading magnetic swipes my cc company text me asking about a charge from walmart superstore in southern cali the only way i think the card got compromised is because of the swiping i use my chip at the other grocery stores that i shop at this is only my speculation hopefully they can update their system and accept chips definitely for the security of their customers be careful of your credit card and also be careful of the charges check your receipts some of the workers type in fake item codes for wrong items because they dont know the produce names deans produce is a great place for fresh produce located on broadway millbrae this place is my goto for fresh produce because it is one of only a few places that mainly has fresh produce unlike safeway which mainly has processed foods with preservatives this way i know which products are getting older and which products are fresher plus they are not too expensive too i have been here many times usually to buy fruit as they have an impressive collection of exotic fruit like durian dragon fruit and papaya in fact if it were not for this place to exist as it had since many many years ago i would never have tried dragon fruit other food products include bottled drinks in the cold aisle located at the back and snacks as well as spices in the middle of the aisles which by the way are a bit too tight to walk through smoothly unfortunately as good as this place gets parking is very tough on broadway which makes it inconvenient to try and go to deans produce only to find that there is no nearby parking for as long as half an hour however on the bright side the store is on broadway making it a very appealing place to walk eat buy and talk overall deans produce is a decent store although i would generally only come to buy fresh fruits when i have the time with that thank you for some nice visits deans produce about a week ago i went into deans produce and i am always here always shopping here i decided to buy some olives and they were all rotten inside so i went to go back the next day to tell them i totally understand that its not the workers fault but when i went it to give it back and give them a heads up the asian older lady was extremely disrespectful im not to sure what her name was because they have no name tags there but the way she was replying to me was disrespectful and she needs to treat her customers right what kind of customer service is this excellent selection of low costhigh quality produce the store is kinda hidden and obviously parking can be tough since this is the burlingame ave of millbrae and clearly this is where the rubber meets the road ive been in at least a dozen times and this most recent visit brought me to something that ive become quite intrigued by fresh jam yes fresh jam i know i should have covered this part of the foodie aisle years ago but i was reminded of the pbj crustless sandwiches of my childhood and never wanted to relive those moments until now i picked up a jar of fresh blueberry jelly and slathered some over an english muffin with almond butter and boy oh boy was it delicious i also noticed that they offer some exotic fruits that typical grocery stores dont offer all that much items such as papaya young coconut bitter melon dragon fruit durian stanky stank fruit i think and so so many others i wanna visit more often but i find myself at safeway far too often maybe just maybe i can visit this spot weekly and feel better about myself when i sit down to enjoy a sliver of dragon fruit there is way more variety and fresh produce here than the other local asian markets however its hard to beat the quality and prices at the nearby farmers market on saturdays or the safeway down the street sometimes if you want middle eastern ingredients this is the place to go parking is ample on the street or nearby lots the cashiers are extremely helpful and nice theyll even give you a box to carry your groceries if you dont want to pay for the bags if youre on a fixed budget dont go there trader joes is cheaper some of their produces are not fresh enough either i have a soft spot for this place its as if im on a dusty cobbled street in greece portugal turkey    and accidentally wandered into a small shop of goods full to the gills with sundry stuff all unexpected little out of the way treasures i love going in here with no agenda just to discover whatever catches my eye eg i got my first taste of dragonfruit from there i bought just one and watched a youtube video of how to cut it  its one of the rare places that carries cherimoyas passion fruit lychees rambutan starfruits and loads of exotic fruits this is my go to place for buying baked beans and hp sauce from englandits half the price of grocery shops where the markup is ridiculous they have assorted bulk olives in brine and fresh feta as well as interesting drinks eg nectars and kefir i love their aisle of sardines olive oils tuna etc and my husband lusts for the imported chocolates sesamepeanut bars oh how i wish i wasnt doing glutenfree cuz they have foccacias fresh baked breads from the bakery of course they have produce and such but i wish they made more of an effort to get organic fruits and veggies their customer service is as authentic as you might imaginetheyre super helpful when i want to return or exchange something they also have another location in san mateo which is larger and with more items but it has a different vibe more like an ordinary grocers i far prefer this millbrae location what no todays purchases went directly into the garbage daikon spoiled and or completely moldy inside melon inedible and crunchy dry and mealy see my photo i dont see why people flock to this place dean should get some standards too far away to go and complain and cant serve daikon oroshi w my saba shio yaki tonight lame yes a great variety of ethnic foods meats and breads same with the vegetables and fruits but check your receipt i checked the receipt while emptying the bag at home i was charged for items i never bought and got overcharged for fruit by the pound this is the second time this happened to me at the same store i ever go to deans produce in millbrae again i will check my receipt right after the clerk is done and before i leave the store great place for produce always come here to get fruit for my juicer the price is much cheaper then other places like safeway and lucky the only thing is the produce expires fast so if im not going to use it the same day i usually go to safeway i usually come here for my weekly fruits and veggies shopping produce is fresh and clean same with the fruits as well they do have middle eastern products as well cheese olive oil breads etc this is the only place where i buy my honey from as well once in a blue moon they do have rare tropical fruits which i am very lucky to find price is reasonable as well wish the store was a little bit more cleaner though when we lived in millbrae we frequented this grocery store i loved it because the produce is so fresh and less expensive than safeway thats just down the street the produce is exceptionally fabulous in the summer  employees are ok not super friendly like other stores but decent they also have exotic desserts and foods from different countries too bread from sheng kee kinder and milka chocolates baklava etc fun place to explore great fresh produce at great prices wish there was something similar near our new residence deans produce and sprouts are my faves for fresh inexpensive produce best place to buy fruits and veggies in millbrae they also have a good selection of canned pickles veggies and fish theres an eastern europeanmiddle eastern influence which i love fresh everything is fresh and very suitable prices love their greek cheese and you can about everything you need if you are shopping mediterranean or middle eastern food um am i missing something here i had high expectations for this location given the  of reviews but compared to its san mateo counterpart it just really doesnt stand up to par first of all their produce options are very limited where were the avocados and they seem to place more of an emphasis on their internationally imported items like canned goods and whatnots also the produce doesnt look very clean and the store itself isnt organized as nicely everything here just looks so drab and unclean  not what i expected at all i now trek down to san mateo just to visit that location as it is much cleaner and the selection of produce is way betterfresher a much better place to go for produce than safeway or luckys although those places may have more variety deans has hardertofind fruits and vegetables like passion fruit and guava and everything is at a lower price i always walk away surprised at how little my groceries cost in addition to produce they also carry dry goods a wide variety of spices seriously almost any spice youd want for dirt cheap priceswhole cardamon dried hibiscus fennel seeds etc and certain mediterraneanmiddle easternasian goods i like to get kalamata olives and feta cheese here for my salads if they had meat this would be my onestop shop every sunday i look forward to my weekly deans trip they have a phenomenal selection of inexpensive high quality produce and ethnic groceries if you are looking for specialty items deans will most likely have it ive been shopping at the newer one in san mateo for a while now only been to this one a couple times it was a nice day and we were eating in the area lots of good product but the unique things are the greek and other european items you dont see in your average markets a place where i can regularly get my borjomi water deans is such a gem and probably my favorite shop in millbrae their selection of exotic and regular produce is pretty comprehensive  their prices are cheap they beat any safeway or whole foods easily the produce is high quality and fresh i was able to pick up mangosteen lychee hawaiian papaya and a variety of tomatoes in one stop its a good place to stop by often because they offer inseason produce and the variety the you can choose from is extensive they also have plenty of snacks that you cant find at most other places like the kindersurprise chocolate eggs  which my kids really love dean’s produce claimed

heating contractors electricians home cleaners landscapers locksmiths movers painters plumbers write a review events talk log in     broadwaymillbrae ca    this is my go to place to buy fresh produce i get their double happiness oranges whenever theyre in stock they carry all the specialty items i love to use in my cooking including thyme basil sage san marzano tomatoes different blends of olive oils anchovies capers and dececco pasta good selection of pears and berries too everything is reasonably priced and in a good location its near restaurants coffee banks and the post office you can pick up some groceries while running other errands so im going to update this review based on what i can come up with this is in regards to a fraudulent charge that i got on my cc i have a specific credit card that i used to churn mileage points on this credit card only gets used at supermarkets and no online shopping at all i only shop in millbrae and visit  places on regular basis deans produce is the only place that takes credit card but only by the swiping option they put a sign that says swipe only no chips of the other places that i use this card all of them use chip as part of the industry standard everyone is required by law to take chip cards by using the emv chip reader and we have not heard of any hackers being able to duplicate emv chips only by reading magnetic swipes my cc company text me asking about a charge from walmart superstore in southern cali the only way i think the card got compromised is because of the swiping i use my chip at the other grocery stores that i shop at this is only my speculation hopefully they can update their system and accept chips definitely for the security of their customers be careful of your credit card and also be careful of the charges check your receipts some of the workers type in fake item codes for wrong items because they dont know the produce names deans produce is a great place for fresh produce located on broadway millbrae this place is my goto for fresh produce because it is one of only a few places that mainly has fresh produce unlike safeway which mainly has processed foods with preservatives this way i know which products are getting older and which products are fresher plus they are not too expensive too i have been here many times usually to buy fruit as they have an impressive collection of exotic fruit like durian dragon fruit and papaya in fact if it were not for this place to exist as it had since many many years ago i would never have tried dragon fruit other food products include bottled drinks in the cold aisle located at the back and snacks as well as spices in the middle of the aisles which by the way are a bit too tight to walk through smoothly unfortunately as good as this place gets parking is very tough on broadway which makes it inconvenient to try and go to deans produce only to find that there is no nearby parking for as long as half an hour however on the bright side the store is on broadway making it a very appealing place to walk eat buy and talk overall deans produce is a decent store although i would generally only come to buy fresh fruits when i have the time with that thank you for some nice visits deans produce about a week ago i went into deans produce and i am always here always shopping here i decided to buy some olives and they were all rotten inside so i went to go back the next day to tell them i totally understand that its not the workers fault but when i went it to give it back and give them a heads up the asian older lady was extremely disrespectful im not to sure what her name was because they have no name tags there but the way she was replying to me was disrespectful and she needs to treat her customers right what kind of customer service is this excellent selection of low costhigh quality produce the store is kinda hidden and obviously parking can be tough since this is the burlingame ave of millbrae and clearly this is where the rubber meets the road ive been in at least a dozen times and this most recent visit brought me to something that ive become quite intrigued by fresh jam yes fresh jam i know i should have covered this part of the foodie aisle years ago but i was reminded of the pbj crustless sandwiches of my childhood and never wanted to relive those moments until now i picked up a jar of fresh blueberry jelly and slathered some over an english muffin with almond butter and boy oh boy was it delicious i also noticed that they offer some exotic fruits that typical grocery stores dont offer all that much items such as papaya young coconut bitter melon dragon fruit durian stanky stank fruit i think and so so many others i wanna visit more often but i find myself at safeway far too often maybe just maybe i can visit this spot weekly and feel better about myself when i sit down to enjoy a sliver of dragon fruit there is way more variety and fresh produce here than the other local asian markets however its hard to beat the quality and prices at the nearby farmers market on saturdays or the safeway down the street sometimes if you want middle eastern ingredients this is the place to go parking is ample on the street or nearby lots the cashiers are extremely helpful and nice theyll even give you a box to carry your groceries if you dont want to pay for the bags if youre on a fixed budget dont go there trader joes is cheaper some of their produces are not fresh enough either i have a soft spot for this place its as if im on a dusty cobbled street in greece portugal turkey    and accidentally wandered into a small shop of goods full to the gills with sundry stuff all unexpected little out of the way treasures i love going in here with no agenda just to discover whatever catches my eye eg i got my first taste of dragonfruit from there i bought just one and watched a youtube video of how to cut it  its one of the rare places that carries cherimoyas passion fruit lychees rambutan starfruits and loads of exotic fruits this is my go to place for buying baked beans and hp sauce from englandits half the price of grocery shops where the markup is ridiculous they have assorted bulk olives in brine and fresh feta as well as interesting drinks eg nectars and kefir i love their aisle of sardines olive oils tuna etc and my husband lusts for the imported chocolates sesamepeanut bars oh how i wish i wasnt doing glutenfree cuz they have foccacias fresh baked breads from the bakery of course they have produce and such but i wish they made more of an effort to get organic fruits and veggies their customer service is as authentic as you might imaginetheyre super helpful when i want to return or exchange something they also have another location in san mateo which is larger and with more items but it has a different vibe more like an ordinary grocers i far prefer this millbrae location what no todays purchases went directly into the garbage daikon spoiled and or completely moldy inside melon inedible and crunchy dry and mealy see my photo i dont see why people flock to this place dean should get some standards too far away to go and complain and cant serve daikon oroshi w my saba shio yaki tonight lame yes a great variety of ethnic foods meats and breads same with the vegetables and fruits but check your receipt i checked the receipt while emptying the bag at home i was charged for items i never bought and got overcharged for fruit by the pound this is the second time this happened to me at the same store i ever go to deans produce in millbrae again i will check my receipt right after the clerk is done and before i leave the store great place for produce always come here to get fruit for my juicer the price is much cheaper then other places like safeway and lucky the only thing is the produce expires fast so if im not going to use it the same day i usually go to safeway i usually come here for my weekly fruits and veggies shopping produce is fresh and clean same with the fruits as well they do have middle eastern products as well cheese olive oil breads etc this is the only place where i buy my honey from as well once

this grocery store i loved it because the produce is so fresh and less expensive than safeway thats just down the street the produce is exceptionally fabulous in the summer  employees are ok not super friendly like other stores but decent they also have exotic desserts and foods from different countries too bread from sheng kee kinder and milka chocolates baklava etc fun place to explore great fresh produce at great prices wish there was something similar near our new residence deans produce and sprouts are my faves for fresh inexpensive produce best place to buy fruits and veggies in

review embed review compliment send message follow eric y stop following eric y  updated review so im going to update this review based on what i can come up with this is in regards to a fraudulent charge that i got on my cc i have a specific credit card that i used to churn mileage points on this credit card only gets used at supermarkets and no online shopping at all i only shop in millbrae and visit  places on regular basis deans produce is the only place that takes credit card but only by the swiping option they put a sign that says swipe only no chips of the other places that i use this card all of them use chip as part of the industry standard everyone is required by law to take chip cards by using the emv chip reader and we have not heard of any hackers being able to duplicate emv chips only by reading magnetic swipes  my cc company text me asking about a charge from walmart superstore in southern cali the only way i think the card got compromised is because of the swiping i use my chip at the other grocery stores that i shop at this is only my speculation hopefully they can update their system and accept chips definitely for the security of their customers be careful of your credit card and also be careful of the charges check your receipts some of the workers type in fake item codes for wrong items because they dont know the produce names was this review … useful

review embed review compliment send message follow christopher y stop following christopher y  listed in yelp  challenge summer  deans produce is a great place for fresh produce located on broadway millbrae this place is my goto for fresh produce because it is one of only a few places that mainly has fresh produce unlike safeway which mainly has processed foods with preservatives this way i know which products are getting older and which products are fresher plus they are not too expensive too i have been here many times usually to buy fruit as they have an impressive collection of exotic fruit like durian dragon fruit and papaya in fact if it were not for this place to exist as it had since many many years ago i would never have tried dragon fruit other food products include bottled drinks in the cold aisle located at the back and snacks as well as spices in the middle of the aisles which by the way are a bit too tight to walk through smoothly unfortunately as good as this place gets parking is very tough on broadway which makes it inconvenient to try and go to deans produce only to find that there is no nearby parking for as long as half an hour however on the bright side the store is on broadway making it a very appealing place to walk eat buy and talk overall deans produce is a decent store although i would generally only come to buy fresh fruits when i have the time with that thank you for some nice visits deans produce was this review … useful  funny  cool  jakleen n millbrae ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow

selection of low costhigh quality produce the store is kinda hidden and obviously parking can be tough since this is the burlingame ave of millbrae and clearly this is where the rubber meets the road ive been in at least a dozen times and this most recent visit brought me to something that ive become quite intrigued by fresh jam yes fresh jam i know i should have covered this part of the foodie aisle years ago but i was reminded of the pbj crustless sandwiches of my childhood and never wanted to relive those moments until now i picked up a jar of fresh blueberry jelly and slathered some over an english muffin with almond butter and boy oh boy was it delicious i also noticed that they offer some exotic fruits that typical grocery stores dont offer all that much items such aspapayayoung coconutbitter melondragon fruitdurian stanky stank fruit i thinkand so so many othersi wanna visit more often but i find myself at safeway far too often maybe just maybe i can visit this spot weekly

of sardines olive oils tuna etc and my husband lusts for the imported chocolates sesamepeanut bars oh how i wish i wasnt doing glutenfree cuz they have foccacias fresh baked breads from the bakery of
