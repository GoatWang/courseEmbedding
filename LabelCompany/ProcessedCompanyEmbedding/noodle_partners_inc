u inc john katzman has raised  million in venture funding to help colleges and universities deliver highquality certificate and degree programs online philadelphiabased osage venture partners led the investment in noodle partners and was joined by new markets venture partners  startups and others katzman tells techcrunch that the challenge in delivering online education at the college and university level has changed dramatically over the last decade and not just because of the rise of smartphones “people did not believe that higher ed could be as good online as a campusbased program that’s because the first wave was full of forprofits that were just not very good schools today there are many great schools online and we know the problem is not the medium the new challenge is building and offering programs that are great but also lower the cost of higher education” katzman said in  when he cofounded u inc with chip paucek and jeremy johnson trump university and the university of phoenix owned by apollo education are two famous examples of unscrupulous forprofit online schools in that earlier wave these organizations sold students on useless degrees and costly seminars that would leave them more in debt than anything else college enrollment in the us has declined for five straight years according to the most recent available data from the national center for education statistics that correlates with a  increase in the cost for undergraduate tuition fees room and board at public colleges and universities and a  increase at private nonprofit institutions between  and  katzman believes that offering more of their degree programs online and at a higher quality than ever before will help colleges reverse that trend new yorkbased noodle

different meats fruits vegetables grains and dairy products organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution the farmers who grow organic produce dont use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds for example organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds so what makes a product organic for certain the us department of agriculture usda established a certification program that requires all organiclabeled foods to meet strict government standards first these standards regulate how such foods are grown handled and processed thus any product labeled as organic must be usda certified you
