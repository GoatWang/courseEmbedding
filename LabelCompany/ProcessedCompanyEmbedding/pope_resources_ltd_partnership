revenue of  million for the first quarter of   cash provided by operations for the quarter ended march   was  million  compared to cash used in operations of  million for the first quarter of   in january  orm timber fund ii inc fund ii sold a acre parcel of timberland for  million recognizing a gain on sale of  million with  million of the gain attributable to pope resources’ unitholders based upon the partnership’s  interest in fund ii “our overall average log price realizations improved slightly compared to the previous quarter with lowervalued species mix masking improvements in the markets for douglasfir and whitewood sawlogs” said tom ringo president and ceo “we trace this improvement in log markets to reductions in log supply caused by unusual amounts of rain and snow in our pacific northwest operating region combined with incremental demand due to market expectations of pending duties on canadian lumber imports” first quarter highlights • harvest volume was  mmbf in q  compared to  mmbf in q   a  increase these harvest volume figures do not include timber deed sales of  mmbf in q  sold by orm timber fund iii the harvest volume and log price realization metrics cited below also exclude these timber deed sales except as noted otherwise • average realized log price per thousand board feet mbf was  in q  compared to  per mbf in q   a  increase • as a percentage of total harvest volume sold to domestic markets in q  decreased to  from  in q   while the mix of volume sold to export markets was  in q  compared to  in q   hardwood cedar and pulpwood log sales make up the balance of harvest volume • fund ii recognized a gain of  million on the sale of one of its tree farms in january  this sale generated a  million distribution to the partnership  • the partnership acquired  acres of timberland in western washington for  million  or  per acre first quarter operating results fee timber fee timber operating income for q  was  million compared to  million for q   our q  results reflect a  million gain on the sale of one of fund ii’s tree farms in northwestern oregon without which our q  operating income would have been  million other than the gain on sale of the tree farm the increase in operating income was driven primarily by the  increase in harvest volume as we had backloaded our  harvest to the fourth quarter during which we produced  of our annual harvest volume timberland investment management operating losses incurred by this segment for q  and q  totaled  and   respectively after eliminating revenue earned from managing the funds of  and  for q  and q   respectively the increase in operating loss is primarily attributable to professional fees associated with the late  launch of our fourth timber fund as well as additional personnel costs to manage our expanding timber fund portfolio real estate our real estate segment posted operating losses of  million and  million for q  and q   respectively in q   we closed on the sale of nine singlefamily lots from our harbor hill development as opposed to no land sales in q  general  administrative ga ga expenses were  million for q  and  million for q  with the increase primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals driven by this year’s improvement in our unit trading price outlook unlike  our  harvest volume should be distributed more evenly throughout the year we expect our total  harvest volume to be between  and  mmbf including timber deed sales in our real estate segment we expect to close on the sale of up to  singlefamily lots from our harbor hill project the majority of which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter as well as a number of other potential land and conservation easement sales the financial schedules accompanying

release contains a number of projections and statements about our expected financial condition operating results business plans and objectives and about management’s plans for future operations and strategies these statements reflect management’s estimates based on current goals and its expectations about future developments because these statements describe our goals objectives and anticipated performance they are inherently uncertain and some or all of these statements may not come to pass accordingly they should not be interpreted as promises of future management actions or financial performance our future actions and actual performance will vary from current expectations and under various circumstances the results of these variations may be material and adverse among those forwardlooking statements contained in this report are statements about management’s expectations for future log prices harvest volumes and markets and statements about our expectations for future sales in our real estate segment readers however should note that all statements other than expressions of historical fact are forwardlooking in nature some of the factors that may cause actual operating results and financial condition to fall short of expectations or that may cause us to deviate from our current plans include our ability to accurately predict fluctuations in log markets domestically and internationally and to adjust our harvest volumes in a timely and appropriate manner political sensitivities and events including the reactions of foreign governments and international treaty organizations and similar bodies that may affect the cost of competing products and demand for our products our ability to anticipate and manage interest rate risk as it affects

environmental remediation obligations including our ability to anticipate and address the political and regulatory climate that impacts these obligations our ability to consummate various pending and anticipated real estate transactions on the terms management expects our ability to manage our timber funds and their assets in a manner that our investors consider acceptable and to raise additional capital or establish new funds on terms that are advantageous to the partnership conditions in the housing construction and woodproducts markets both domestically and globally that affect demand for our products the effects of competition particularly by larger and betterfinanced competitors fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that affect both competition for sales of our products and

conditions affecting credit markets as they affect the availability of capital and costs of borrowing labor equipment and transportation costs that affect our net income our ability to anticipate and

export log market experienced a steady price decline in response the partnership deferred a portion of its anticipated firsthalf log production with the intent of balancing out the annual harvest with increased production in the third and fourth quarters while third quarter production was accelerated yeartodate log volumes still lag  levels by  the partnership also shifted a significant amount of production mix away from the highestvalued largediameter export market segment to the lowervalued domestic and smalldiameter export market segments this was intended to allow the excessive west coast export log inventories within the largediameter export market segment to draw down this product mix shift has resulted in a  decrease in export production and a  increase in domestic production over  yeartodate levels the combination of the decline in export prices along with the lower yeartodate volumes and shifts in product mix account for the decrease in  timber revenues domestic log prices during the first three quarters of  have remained relatively fairly similar to the prior year despite increases in the supply of domestic logs entering this segment in reaction to the declining export market there has been a  increase in price of domestic western red cedar over  which has been a contributing factor in this trend even though cedar is limited to  of this years domestic production to date the average prices per mbf of domestic logs realized were  and  for  and  respectively pulp and hardwood log prices in  are on average slightly higher than  prices but  prices experienced more volatility with first quarter declines being offset by higher second and third quarter prices the partnership sells its logs and trees in two major markets export and domestic markets indirect sales to the export market totaled  and  of total timber revenues for the nine month periods ending september   and  respectively the export demand for logs is directly affected by the demand from asian countries since the partnerships export logs are sold primarily in the japanese log market the strength of the japanese housing industry and the relative strength of the united states dollar directly affect the demand for export logs the export market weakened in the first three quarters due to high japanese and west coast log inventory levels a relatively strong dollar and increased competition from lowerquality lowerpriced species and an increase in the supply of sawed lumber versus logs into japan  timberland resources continued the domestic demand for logs is directly affected by the level of new home construction and repair and remodeling business activity changes in general economic and demographic factors have historically caused fluctuations in housing starts this in turn affects demand for lumber and commodity wood prices which drives the demand for logs throughout the us lumber manufacturing capacity continues to be rationalized and consolidated into larger facilities this trend holds true for the partnerships operating region as the lumber manufacturing capacity is rationalized and consolidated into larger facilities as the number of sawmills has declined the partnership has thus far been successful in finding replacement outlets for its domestic logs since surviving sawmills are larger in scale the partnership does not believe the decline in the number of domestic sawmills will materially impact its nearterm operations property development property development revenues for the periods ended september   and  were  and  respectively such revenues are derived from residential development and incomeproducing properties residential development consists of the sale of singlefamily homes finished lots and undeveloped acreage incomeproducing properties consist of providing water and sewer services to properties in the port ludlow area a marina golf course commercial center and rv park operated by the partnership the port

sale of  developed lots and  homes this compares to the prior years comparable period sales of  of  developed lots and  homes the revenue per sale depends on the quality and size of the home the subdivision and the location of the lot current yeartodate sales have been favorably affected by the continuing strength of the puget sound economy and favorable interest rate environment the port ludlow planning forum process has continued to produce positive results the outstanding level of participation and enthusiasm among residents of this special community was encouraging in the next phase of the process the partnership will seek to obtain the following approvals from residents  unify numerous homeowner associations under one newlyformed selfgovernance entity  consolidate

services to large investors in acquiring managing and disposing of timberland investments selling general and administrative expenses were  and  for the nine months ending september   and  respectively the increase in expenses is primarily due to the following payroll and employeerelated costs such as education insurance travel and entertainment professional services related to computer technology to enhance our internal systems to remain competitive expenses related to the proxy statement and unitholder holder vote held on march   and costs associated with the abovementioned strategic initiative the partnership remains focused on pursuing timberland acquisition opportunities through our newlyformed investment portfolio management business ormllc participated in recent

commitment management has considerable discretion to increase or decrease the level of logs cut and thereby may increase or decrease net income and cash flow assuming of course log prices and demand remain stable managements current plan is to harvest approximately  million board feet of timber in  which compares to  million board feet in  since harvest plans are based on demand price and cash

overall cash and cash equivalents decreased by  the cash generated was primarily used for repayments of longterm debt of  and capital expenditures of  related to roads reforestation infrastructure and equipment the partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of  per unit payable on september   to unitholders of record as of september   the practice of the partnership has been to make cash distributions only for the purpose of defraying estimated federal and state tax liability of unitholders on their flowthrough share of the partnerships net income and as approved from time to time by management the recently enacted reduction in the federal capital gains rate factored into the third quarter distribution thus far in  the partnership has made three cash distributions totaling  per

business plans and objectives these statements reflect managements estimates based upon our current goals in light of managements knowledge of existing circumstances and expectations about future developments statements about expectations and future performance are forward looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws which describe our goals objectives and anticipated performance these statements can be identified by words such as anticipate believe expect intend and similar expressions these statements are inherently uncertain and some or all of these statements may not come to pass accordingly you should not interpret these statements as promises that we will perform at a given level or that we will take any or all of the actions we currently expect to take our future actions as well as our actual performance will vary from our current expectations and under various circumstances these variations may be material and adverse some of the factors that may cause our actual operating results and financial condition to fall short of our expectations are set forth in the part of this report entitled risk factors in part ii item a below some of the issues that may have an adverse and material impact on our business operating results and financial condition include economic conditions that affect consumer demand for our products and the prices we receive for them both domestically and overseas particularly in certain parts of asia government regulation that affects our ability to access our timberlands and harvest logs from those lands factors that affect the timing and amounts realized from the sales if any of our real estate holdings the implications of significant indirect sales to overseas customers including regulatory and tax matters the effect of financial market conditions on our investment portfolio and related liquidity the effects of competition especially from larger betterfinanced competitors environmental and land use regulations that limit our ability to harvest timber and develop property access to debt financing by our customers as well as ourselves the impacts of climate change and natural disasters on our timberlands and on surrounding areas factors that affect our ability to estimate accurately the extent of our environmental liabilities and the cost of remediating the known areas of exposure and the potential impacts of fluctuations in foreign currency rates as they affect demand for our products from time to time we identify other risks and uncertainties in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission the forwardlooking statements in this report reflect our estimates and expectations as of the date of the report and unless required by law we do not undertake to update these statements as our business operations and environment change this discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included with this report executive overview pope resources a delaware limited partnership we or the partnership is engaged in three primary businesses the first and by far most significant segment in terms of owned assets and operations is the fee timber segment this segment includes timberlands owned directly by the partnership and the three private equity funds fund i fund ii and fund iii collectively the funds fund is assets were sold in  and the fund is expected to terminate in  when we refer to the timberland owned by the partnership we describe it as the partnerships tree farms we refer to timberland owned by the funds as the funds tree farms when referring collectively to the partnerships and funds timberlands we will refer to them as the combined tree farms operations in this segment consist of growing timber to be harvested as logs for sale to domestic manufacturers and export brokers the second most significant business in terms of total assets owned is the development and sale of real estate real estate activities primarily take the form of securing permits entitlements and in some cases installing infrastructure for raw land development and then realizing that lands value by selling larger parcels to buyers who will take the land further up the value chain either to home buyers or to developers and lessors of commercial property since these projects span multiple years the real estate segment may incur losses for multiple years while a project is developed and will not recognize operating income until that project is sold in addition within this segment we sometimes negotiate and sell development rights in the form of conservation easements ces on fee timber properties to preclude future development our third business which we refer to as timberland management is engaged in organizing and managing private equity timber funds using capital invested by third parties and the partnership our current strategy for adding timberland acreage is centered on our private equity timber fund business model we have closed and invested capital from three timber funds with assets under management totaling approximately  million as of june   based on the most recent appraisals our  coinvestments in funds i and ii and our  coinvestment in fund iii which collectively totaled  million at time of acquisition afford us a share of the funds operating cash flows while also allowing us to earn asset management and timberland management fees as well as potential future incentive fees based upon the overall success of each fund we also believe that this strategy allows us to maintain sophisticated expertise in timberland acquisition valuation and management more costeffectively than we could maintain for the partnerships timberlands alone we believe our coinvestment strategy also enhances our credibility with existing and prospective investors by demonstrating that we have both an operational and a financial commitment to the funds success the funds are consolidated into our financial statements but then income or loss attributable to equity owned by third parties is removed from consolidated results in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income under the caption net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interestsorm timber funds to arrive at comprehensive income attributable to unitholders of the partnership the challenge for our real estate segment centers around how and when to harvest parcels of our acre portfolio in western washington to optimize value realization by selling the property balancing the longterm risks and costs of carrying and developing a property against the potential for income and positive cash flows upon sale second quarter highlights harvest volume was  million board feet mmbf

well as a acre conservation land sale for  outlook log prices for  reached what we expect to be their lowest point in the second quarter due to this weaker pricing environment we have deferred a portion of our harvest and expect total annual log harvest and stumpage sale volume of between  and  mmbf for  the majority of this reduction is attributable to tree farms owned by the funds that are located in areas more strongly influenced by the export market we expect that log markets will continue to be volatile over the next several quarters with a strengthening trend overall this volatility will influence our harvest decisions as the year unfolds we expect additional land sales from our real estate segment over the remainder of  although the timing of these transactions could be impacted

owned by the partnership and  acres of timberland owned by the funds fee timber revenue is earned primarily from the harvest and sale of logs from these timberlands which are located in western washington northwestern oregon and northern california this revenue source is driven primarily by the volume of timber harvested and the average log price realized on the sale of that timber our harvest volume is based typically on manufactured log sales to domestic mills and log export brokers we also occasionally sell rights to harvest timber timber deed sale from the combined tree farms the metrics used to calculate volumes sold and average price realized during the reporting periods exclude the timber deed sales except where stated otherwise harvest volumes are generally expressed in million board feet mmbf increments while harvest revenue and related costs are generally expressed in terms of revenue or cost per thousand board feet mbf fee timber revenue is also derived from commercial thinning operations ground leases for cellular communication towers and royalties from gravel mines and quarries all of which along with timber deed sales are included in other revenue below commercial thinning consists of the selective cutting of timber stands not yet of optimal harvest age however they do have some commercial value thus allowing us to earn revenue while at the

due primarily to the decline in harvest volume revenue comparing q  to q  log sale revenue in q  decreased  million or  from  million in q  to  million in q  trends that developed during q  continued to dampen log prices during q  and we responded by decreasing our harvest volume  from q  to q  demand from the export market remained weak due to the strength of the us dollar as well as competition in japan from europeansourced products and the continued effects in china of reduced credit availability and high log inventories at its ports logs that have recently been directed to the export market were diverted to the domestic market which itself was already wellsupplied due to the unseasonably mild weather in the pacific northwest during the first half of the year these regional weather conditions afforded timberland owners excellent access to timber not typically available in the first half of the year an ongoing lackluster recovery in the us housing market added further downside price pressure due to weak demand for lumber which in turn reduced the price that mills were willing to pay for logs in response to these market conditions we decided to defer harvest volume to future periods when log prices improve comparing q  to q  log sale revenue in q  decreased  million or  from  million in q  to  million in q  primarily as a result of a  decrease in harvest volume and an  decrease in average realized log prices factors affecting the log market during q  as described in the above paragraph were in stark contrast to the strong log markets we experienced during q  which followed a multiyear cyclical high during the first quarter of  the decrease in other revenue from q  to q  was primarily attributable to a  reduction in commercial thinning activity revenue and

reduction in revenue was the result of a  decrease in harvest volume and a  decrease in average realized log prices log markets during the first half of  particularly in the first quarter were at a multiyear cyclical high due to strong demand from the export market to asia combined with a slowly strengthening domestic market as us housing starts rose to a rate of  million units per year in contrast export markets in the first half of  have been impacted negatively by unfavorable currency exchange rates tight credit conditions in china and high log inventories at asian ports these factors combined to drive down export demand and prices domestic markets have been affected by unseasonably mild weather in the pacific northwest high log and lumber inventories and sluggish lumber

removing this seasonal opportunity looking forward to the balance of the year these same lower elevation timberlands may allow us to harvest later in the year when harvest activities are curtailed due to extreme fire conditions on higher elevation properties lower elevation timberlands subject to marine influence are often able to be harvested in hot dry conditions when log prices may be elevated due to restricted log supply douglasfir harvest volume as a percent of overall harvest increased from  in q  to  in q  conversely the component of whitewood harvest volume decreased from  in q  to  in

these statements reflect managements estimates based upon our current goals in light of managements knowledge of existing circumstances and expectations about future developments statements about expectations and future performance are forward looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws which describe our goals objectives and anticipated performance these statements can be identified by words such as anticipate believe expect intend and similar expressions these statements are inherently uncertain and some or all of these statements may not come to pass accordingly you should not interpret these statements as promises that we will perform at a given level or that we will take any or all of the actions we currently expect to take our future actions as well as our actual performance will vary from our current expectations and under various circumstances these variations may be material and adverse some of the factors that may cause our actual operating results and financial condition to fall short of our expectations are set forth in the part of this report entitled risk factors in part ii item a below some of the issues that may have an adverse and material impact on our business operating results and financial condition include economic conditions that affect consumer demand for our products and the prices we receive for them both domestically and overseas particularly in certain parts of asia government regulation that affects our ability to access our timberlands and harvest logs from those lands factors that affect the timing and amounts realized from the sales if any of our real estate holdings the implications of significant indirect sales to overseas customers including regulatory and tax matters the effect of financial market conditions on our investment portfolio and related liquidity the effects of competition especially from larger betterfinanced competitors environmental and land use regulations that limit our ability to harvest timber and develop property access to debt financing by our customers as well as ourselves the impacts of climate change and natural disasters on our timberlands and on surrounding areas and the potential impacts of fluctuations in foreign currency rates as they affect demand for our products from time to time we identify other risks and uncertainties in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission the forwardlooking statements in this report reflect our estimates and expectations as of the date of the report and unless required by law we do not undertake to update these statements as our business operations and environment change this discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included with this report executive overview pope resources a delaware limited partnership we or the partnership is engaged in three primary businesses the first and by far most significant segment in terms of owned assets and operations is the fee timber segment this segment includes timberlands owned directly by the partnership and operations of the three private equity funds fund i fund ii and fund iii collectively the funds when we refer to the timberland owned by the partnership we describe it as the partnerships tree farms we refer to timberland owned by the funds as the funds tree farms when referring collectively to the partnerships and funds timberlands we will refer to them as the combined tree farms operations in this segment consist of growing timber to be harvested as logs for sale to export brokers and domestic manufacturers the second most significant business in terms of total assets owned is the development and sale of real estate real estate activities primarily take the form of securing permits entitlements and in some cases installing infrastructure for raw land development and then realizing that lands value by selling larger parcels to buyers who will take the land further up the value chain either to home buyers or to developers and lessors of commercial property since these projects span multiple years the real estate segment may incur losses for multiple years while a project is developed and will not recognize operating income until that project is sold in addition within this segment we sometimes negotiate and sell development rights in the form of conservation easements ces on fee timber properties to preclude future development our third business which we refer to as timberland management is engaged in organizing and managing private equity timber funds using capital invested by third parties and the partnership our current strategy for adding timberland acreage is centered on our private equity timber fund business model we have closed and invested capital from three timber funds with assets under management totaling approximately  million as of september   based on the most recent appraisals our  coinvestments in funds i and ii and our  coinvestment in fund iii which collectively totaled  million at time of acquisition afford us a share of the funds operating cash flows while also allowing us to earn asset management and timberland management fees as well as potential future incentive fees based upon the overall success of each fund we also believe that this strategy allows us to maintain sophisticated expertise in timberland acquisition valuation and management more costeffectively than we could maintain for the partnerships timberlands alone we believe our coinvestment strategy also enhances our credibility with existing and prospective investors by demonstrating that we have both an operational and a financial commitment to the funds success the funds are consolidated into our financial statements but then income or loss attributable to equity owned by third parties is removed from consolidated results in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income under the caption net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interestsorm timber funds to arrive at comprehensive income attributable to unitholders of the partnership the challenge for our real estate segment centers around how and when to harvest parcels of our acre portfolio in western washington to optimize value realization by selling the property balancing the longterm risks and costs of carrying and developing a property against the potential for income and positive cash flows upon sale third quarter highlights  harvest volume was  million board feet mmbf in q  compared to  mmbf in q  an  increase harvest

by the volume of timber harvested and the average log price realized on the sale of that timber our volume harvested is typically based on manufactured log sales to domestic mills or log export

increase in operating expenses revenue comparing q  to q  log sale revenue in q  decreased  million or  from  million in q  to  million in q  weaker log prices in both the domestic and export log markets caused a  decrease in average realized price while a seasonal slowdown in our harvest volume resulted in a  reduction in harvest volume during the current quarter the market price for logs typically declines during the summer months when favorable weather conditions bring increased supply to the market resulting in weaker prices we often plan our annual harvest with the expectation that we will throttle back our harvest levels during the third quarter saving the volume for seasonally stronger markets during other times of the year in addition log inventories continued to expand at asian ports as enduser demand for logs failed to keep pace with log imports without the price support in the export market prices in the domestic market fell as well with only minimal support from the very slow housing market recovery the increase in other revenue generated in q  compared to q  consisted primarily of a timber deed sale by fund iii of  representing  mmbf of timber offset partially
