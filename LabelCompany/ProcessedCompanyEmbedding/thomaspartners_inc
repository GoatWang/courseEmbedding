thomaspartners® dividend growth balanced income  balanced income strategy print share this page  share to facebook share via twitter share to linkedin share to google english  thomaspartners® balanced income strategy the thomaspartners balanced income strategy combines the firms dividend growth strategy with fixed income investments the strategy has a baseline allocation of  equities and  fixed income which can be adjusted by the thomaspartners investment team to help meet its three objectives the first objective monthly income wherever you are in life it’s likely that one of your primary financial goals is to generate income—income that can help you live comfortably today or income that you can invest now and draw from when you retire thomaspartners balanced income seeks to provide monthly income by investing in companies with predictable dividends and interestpaying fixed income investments the second objective income growth to assist in offsetting the impact of inflation the thomaspartners balanced income portfolio strategically invests within and allocates across dividendgrowth companies and fixed income investments in an effort to grow the portfolio’s income over time how are dividendgrowing companies and fixed income investments chosen each company is carefully analyzed its dividendgrowing track record—and its ability to sustain that growth in the future—is considered questioned and evaluated and once selected the company is continuously reevaluated if a company fails to meet thomaspartners’ high standards it’s eliminated the firms fixed income philosophy is riskaverse with fundamentally driven positions chosen based on credit spreads and duration the third objective competitive total returns over time pursue the retirement you want with an investment strategy that’s built to prepare you for the years ahead in addition to regular income and income growth the thomaspartners balanced income strategy seeks to deliver competitive total returns over time through income generation and price appreciation if you’re at a stage of life where you don’t need to withdraw your income you can enjoy the power of compounding since accumulated income can be reinvested in the thomaspartners balanced income strategy over time estimated income growth since inception estimated growth since inception beginning  and ending  the hypothetical

and do not protect against losses in declining markets investments in managed accounts should be considered in view of a larger more diversified investment portfolio there are risks associated with any investment approach and the thomaspartners strategies have their own set of risks first there are the risks associated with investing in dividendpaying stocks including but not limited to the risk that stocks in the strategy may reduce or stop paying dividends affecting the strategy’s ability to generate income second investor sentiment could cause dividendpaying equities to fall out of favor and decrease in price third there are risks associated with investing in fixed income asset classes including through the use of exchangetraded funds etfs that include but are not limited to interest

includes all publicly traded us companies with market capitalization of at least  billion in today’s dollars adjusted historically for inflation beginning in  membership in each dividend classification is set as of january  for each year and then held constant for the next month period each a “period” dividend growers and initiators include stocks that initiated or increased their dividend over the period nochange stocks are those that maintained their existing dividend at some point over the period dividend nonpayers are companies that did not pay a dividend at any time over

income strategy composite as shown does not represent any one account beginning in august  the fixed income allocation for the balanced income strategy for accounts opened through the schwab connection platform will be invested in etfs to gain exposure to fixed income rather than the historical use of individual bonds and etfs for the strategy as such a client’s actual performance will vary from the reported composite performance because of this change in investment vehicles the thomaspartners dividend growth strategy composite is shown for illustrative purposes and is not available for direct investment it does not represent the performance of any actual account estimated annual income is hypothetical hypothetical performance results have inherent limitations no representation is made that a client will achieve results similar to those shown actual accounts managed by thomaspartners may have had performance that differs from the performance shown in the chart during comparable periods due to the customization of advice to each client and other factors the estimated income growth since inception charts assume that a client invested  million in the strategy on its inception date dividend growth— balanced income— each period’s estimated annual income shown is the product of that initial  million investment and the accumulation of capital appreciation plus reinvestment of all distributions of income since the inception date multiplied by the annualized strategy yield the strategy’s annualized yield at each listed measurement date is derived by annualizing the last dividend paid for each stock in the portfolio and dividing that dollar amount by the price of the stock the dividend yield for the sp ® index and the nasdaq us broad dividend achievers total return index daatr is obtained from bloomberg for  and  the dividend yield is calculated using the gross dividend receipts over the prior year divided by the ending index value this calculation is different than in prior years the dividend yield for the daatr was previously calculated by thomaspartners based on the methodology recommended by the index provider please note that the strategy’s yieldcalculation methodology may result in a higher yield than the index yield methodology because generally the dividend paying equities in the strategy will increase their dividends over the course of a month period resulting in an annualized methodology based on the last dividend paid for each stock being higher than a methodology using the actual dividends paid over the trailing  months returns are expressed in us dollars presented net of fees and expenses and include the reinvestment of all income prior to the addition of wrap accounts beginning  for dividend growth
