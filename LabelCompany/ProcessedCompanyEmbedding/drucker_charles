died november   in claremont california of natural causes at  druckers wife doris died in october  at the age of  work and philosophyedit early influencesedit among druckers early influences was the austrian economist joseph schumpeter a friend of his realized that keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities” drucker wrote “while i was interested in the behavior of people” over the next  years drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings as opposed to the crunching of numbers his books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him “i have been saying for many years” drucker once remarked “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline” as a young writer drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative german philosopher friedrich julius stahl and another called “the jewish question in germany” — that were burned and banned by the nazis the business thinkeredit druckers career as a business thinker took off in  when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of general motors gm one of the largest companies in the world at that time his experiences in europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority he shared his fascination with donaldson brown the mastermind behind the administrative controls at gm in  brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a political audit a twoyear socialscientific analysis of the corporation drucker attended every board meeting interviewed employees and analyzed production and decisionmaking processes the resulting book concept of the corporation popularized gms multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles consulting engagements and additional books gm however was hardly thrilled with the final product drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to reexamine a host of longstanding policies on customer relations dealer relations employee relations and more inside the corporation drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical gms revered chairman alfred sloan was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist” drucker later recalled “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence” drucker taught that management is “a liberal art” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history sociology psychology philosophy culture and religion he also believed strongly that all institutions including those in the private sector have a responsibility to the whole of society “the fact is” drucker wrote in his  management tasks responsibilities practices “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers if the managers of our major institutions and especially of business do not take responsibility for the common good no one else can or will” drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands he was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress drucker analyzed it and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run his approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century by that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production executives thought they knew how to run companies and drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs lest organizations become stale but he did so in a sympathetic way he assumed that his readers were intelligent rational hardworking people of good will if their organizations struggled he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas a narrow conception of problems or internal misunderstandings drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management he became legendary among many of postwar japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their wartorn homeland he advised the heads of general motors sears general electric wr grace and ibm among many others over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the american red cross and the salvation army his advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the adela investment company a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of latin america druckers writingsedit druckers  books have been translated into more than thirtysix languages two are novels one an autobiography he is the coauthor of a book on japanese painting and made eight series of educational films on management topics he also penned a regular column in the wall street journal for  years and contributed frequently to the harvard business review the atlantic monthly and the economist his work is especially popular in japan even more so after the publication of what if the female manager of a highschool baseball team read drucker’s management a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film his popularity in japan may be compared with that of his contemporary w edwards deming peter drucker also wrote a book in  called the essential drucker it is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of peter druckers work on management the information gathered is a collection from his previous findings the practice of management  to management challenges for the st century  this book offers in druckers words a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management he also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management key ideasedit drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management and several ideas run through most of his writings decentralization and simplification drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized according to drucker corporations tend to produce too many products hire employees they dont need when a better solution would be outsourcing and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid the concept of knowledge worker in his  book the landmarks of tomorrow since then knowledgebased work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide the prediction of the death of the blue collar worker the changing face of the us auto industry is a testimony to this prediction the concept of what eventually came to be known as outsourcing he used the example of front room and back room of each business a company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business back room activities should be handed over to other companies for whom these tasks are the front room activities the importance of the nonprofit sector which he calls the third sector private sector and the government sector being the first two nongovernment organizations ngos play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world a profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies a lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us from their price respect for the worker drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities he taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employees value to the organization central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organizations most valuable resource and that a managers job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so a belief in what he called the sickness of government drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need andor want though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government the chapter the sickness of government in his book the age of discontinuity formed the basis of new public management a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the s and s the need for planned abandonment businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to yesterdays successes rather than seeing when they are no longer useful a belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure the need for community early in his career drucker predicted the end of economic man and advocated the creation of a plant community where an individuals social needs could be met he later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized and by the s suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride the need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals rather than subordinating an institution to a single value this concept of management by objectives and selfcontrol forms the keynote of his  landmark the practice of management a companys primary responsibility is to serve its customers profit is not the primary goal but rather an essential condition for the companys continued existence and sustainability a belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankinds noblest inventions “do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed” in the s by drucker the slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as  in his wall street journal wsj article entitled “sell the mailroom” in  by way of recognition drucker was posthumously inducted into the outsourcing hall of fame for his outstanding work in the field criticism of druckers workedit the wall street journal researched several of his lectures in  and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts drucker was off the mark for example when he told an audience that english was the official language for all employees at japan’s mitsui trading company drucker’s defense “i use anecdotes to make a point not to write history” and while he was known for his prescience he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts he predicted for instance that the nation’s financial center would shift from new york to washington others maintain that one of drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively critic dale krueger said that the system is difficult to implement and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control as opposed to fostering creativity to meet their goals druckers classic concept of the corporation criticized general motors at a time when it was in some ways the most successful corporation in the world many of gms executives considered drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward alfred p sloan refrained from personal hostility toward drucker but even sloan considered druckers critiques of gms management to be dead wrong awards and honorsedit drucker was awarded the presidential medal of freedom by us president george w bush on july   he also received honors from the governments of austria including the grand silver medal for services to the republic of austria in  the grand gold decoration for services to the republic of austria in  and the austrian cross of honour for science and art st class in  and japan order of the sacred treasure rd class  june  drucker was the honorary chairman of the peter f drucker foundation for nonprofit management now the leader to leader institute from  through  in  he was awarded new york university’s highest

of management was voted the third most influential management book of the th century in a poll of the fellows of the academy of management in claremont california eleventh street between college avenue and dartmouth avenue was renamed drucker way in october  to commemorate the th anniversary of druckers birth drucker was posthumously honored when he was inducted into the outsourcing hall of

natural causes at  druckers wife doris died in october  at the age of  work and philosophyedit early influencesedit among druckers early influences was the austrian economist joseph schumpeter a friend of his realized that keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities” drucker wrote “while i was interested in the behavior of people” over the next  years drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings as opposed to the crunching of numbers his books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him “i have been saying for many years” drucker once remarked “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline” as a young writer drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative german philosopher friedrich julius stahl and another called “the jewish question in germany” — that were burned and banned by the nazis the business thinkeredit druckers career as a business thinker took off in  when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of general motors gm one of the largest companies in the world at that time his experiences in europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority he shared his fascination with donaldson brown the mastermind behind the administrative controls at gm in  brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a political audit a twoyear socialscientific analysis of the corporation drucker attended every board meeting interviewed employees and analyzed production and decisionmaking processes the resulting book concept of the corporation popularized gms multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles consulting engagements and additional books gm however was hardly thrilled with the final product drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to reexamine a host of longstanding policies on customer relations dealer relations employee relations and more inside the corporation drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical gms revered chairman alfred sloan was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist” drucker later recalled “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence” drucker taught that management is “a liberal art” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history sociology psychology philosophy culture and religion he also believed strongly that all institutions including those in the private sector have a responsibility to the whole of society “the fact is” drucker wrote in his  management tasks responsibilities practices “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers if the managers of our major institutions and especially of business do not take responsibility for the common good no one else can or will” drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands he was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress drucker analyzed it and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run his approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century by that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production executives thought they knew how to run companies and drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs lest organizations become stale but he did so in a sympathetic way he assumed that his readers were intelligent rational hardworking people of good will if their organizations struggled he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas a narrow conception of problems or internal misunderstandings drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management he became legendary among many of postwar japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their wartorn homeland he advised the heads of general motors sears general electric wr grace and ibm among many others over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the american red cross and the salvation army his advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the adela investment company a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of latin america druckers writingsedit druckers  books have been translated into more than thirtysix languages two are novels one an autobiography he is the coauthor of a book on japanese painting and made eight series of educational films on management topics he also penned a regular column in the wall street journal for  years and contributed frequently to the harvard business review the atlantic monthly and the economist his work is especially popular in japan even more so after the publication of what if the female manager of a highschool baseball team read drucker’s management a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film his popularity in japan may be compared with that of his contemporary w edwards deming peter drucker also wrote a book in  called the essential drucker it is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of peter druckers work on management the information gathered is a collection from his previous findings the practice of management  to management challenges for the st century  this book offers in druckers words a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management he also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management key ideasedit drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management and several ideas run through most of his writings decentralization and simplification drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized according to drucker corporations tend to produce too many products hire employees they dont need when a better solution would be outsourcing and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid the concept of knowledge worker in his  book the landmarks of tomorrow since then knowledgebased work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide the prediction of the death of the blue collar worker the changing face of the us auto industry is a testimony to this prediction the concept of what eventually came to be known as outsourcing he used the example of front room and back room of each business a company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business back room activities should be handed over to other companies for whom these tasks are the front room activities the importance of the nonprofit sector which he calls the third sector private sector and the government sector being the first two nongovernment organizations ngos play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world a profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies a lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us from their price respect for the worker drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities he taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employees value to the organization central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organizations most valuable resource and that a managers job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so a belief in what he called the sickness of government drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need andor want though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government the chapter the sickness of government in his book the age of discontinuity formed the basis of new public management a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the s and s the need for planned abandonment businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to yesterdays successes rather than seeing when they are no longer useful a belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure the need for community early in his career drucker predicted the end of economic man and advocated the creation of a plant community where an individuals social needs could be met he later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized and by the s suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride the need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals rather than subordinating an institution to a single value this concept of management by objectives and selfcontrol forms the keynote of his  landmark the practice of management a companys primary responsibility is to serve its customers profit is not the primary goal but rather an essential condition for the companys continued existence and sustainability a belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankinds noblest inventions “do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed” in the s by drucker the slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as  in his wall street journal wsj article entitled “sell the mailroom” in  by way of recognition drucker was posthumously inducted into the outsourcing hall of fame for his outstanding work in the field criticism of druckers workedit the wall street journal researched several of his lectures in  and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts drucker was off the mark for example when he told an audience that english was the official language for all employees at japan’s mitsui trading company drucker’s defense “i use anecdotes to make a point not to write history” and while he was known for his prescience he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts he predicted for instance that the nation’s financial center would shift from new york to washington others maintain that one of drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively critic dale krueger said that the system is difficult to implement and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control as opposed to fostering creativity to meet their goals druckers classic concept of the corporation criticized general motors at a time when it was in some ways the most successful corporation in the world many of gms executives considered drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward alfred p sloan refrained from personal hostility toward drucker but even sloan considered druckers critiques of gms management to be dead wrong awards and honorsedit drucker was awarded the presidential medal of freedom by us president george w bush on july   he also received honors from the governments of austria including the grand silver medal for services to the republic of austria in  the grand gold decoration for services to the republic of austria in  and the austrian cross of honour for science and art st class in  and japan order of the sacred treasure rd class  june  drucker was the honorary chairman of

activities the importance of the nonprofit sector which he calls the third sector private sector and the government sector being the first two nongovernment organizations ngos play crucial roles in

government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need andor want though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government the chapter the sickness of government in his book the age of discontinuity formed the basis of new public management a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the s and s the need for planned abandonment businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to yesterdays successes rather than seeing when they are no longer useful a belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure the need for community early in his career drucker predicted the end of economic man and advocated the creation of a plant community where an individuals social needs could be met he later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized and by the s suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride the need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals rather than subordinating an institution to a single value this concept of management by objectives and selfcontrol forms the keynote of his  landmark the practice of management a companys primary responsibility is to serve its customers profit is not the primary goal but rather an essential condition for the companys continued existence and sustainability a belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankinds noblest inventions “do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed” in the s by drucker the slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as  in his wall street journal wsj article entitled “sell the mailroom” in  by way of recognition drucker was posthumously inducted into the outsourcing hall of fame for his outstanding work in the field criticism of druckers workedit the wall street journal researched several of his lectures in  and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts drucker was off the mark for example when he told an audience that english was the official language for all employees at japan’s mitsui trading company drucker’s defense “i use anecdotes to make a point not to write history” and while he was known for his prescience he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts he predicted for instance that the nation’s financial center would shift from new york to washington others maintain that one of drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively critic dale krueger said that the system is difficult to implement and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control as opposed to fostering creativity to meet their goals druckers classic concept of the corporation criticized general motors at a time when it was in some ways the most successful corporation in the world many of gms executives considered drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward alfred p sloan refrained from personal hostility toward drucker but even sloan considered druckers critiques of gms management to be dead wrong awards and honorsedit drucker was awarded the presidential medal of freedom by us

natural causes at  druckers wife doris died in october  at the age of  work and philosophyedit early influencesedit among druckers early influences was the austrian economist joseph schumpeter a friend of his realized that keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities” drucker wrote “while i was interested in the behavior of people” over the next  years drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings as opposed to the crunching of numbers his books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him “i have been saying for many years” drucker once remarked “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline” as a young writer drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative german philosopher friedrich julius stahl and another called “the jewish question in germany” — that were burned and banned by the nazis the business thinkeredit druckers career as a business thinker took off in  when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of general motors gm one of the largest companies in the world at that time his experiences in europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority he shared his fascination with donaldson brown the mastermind behind the administrative controls at gm in  brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a political audit a twoyear socialscientific analysis of the corporation drucker attended every board meeting interviewed employees and analyzed production and decisionmaking processes the resulting book concept of the corporation popularized gms multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles consulting engagements and additional books gm however was hardly thrilled with the final product drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to reexamine a host of longstanding policies on customer relations dealer relations employee relations and more inside the corporation drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical gms revered chairman alfred sloan was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist” drucker later recalled “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence” drucker taught that management is “a liberal art” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history sociology psychology philosophy culture and religion he also believed strongly that all institutions including those in the private sector have a responsibility to the whole of society “the fact is” drucker wrote in his  management tasks responsibilities practices “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers if the managers of our major institutions and especially of business do not take responsibility for the common good no one else can or will” drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands he was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress drucker analyzed it and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run his approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century by that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production executives thought they knew how to run companies and drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs lest organizations become stale but he did so in a sympathetic way he assumed that his readers were intelligent rational hardworking people of good will if their organizations struggled he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas a narrow conception of problems or internal misunderstandings drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management he became legendary among many of postwar japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their wartorn homeland he advised the heads of general motors sears general electric wr grace and ibm among many others over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the american red cross and the salvation army his advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the adela investment company a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of latin america druckers writingsedit druckers  books have been translated into more than thirtysix languages two are novels one an autobiography he is the coauthor of a book on japanese painting and made eight series of educational films on management topics he also penned a regular column in the wall street journal for  years and contributed frequently to the harvard business review the atlantic monthly and the economist his work is especially popular in japan even more so after the publication of what if the female manager of a highschool baseball team read drucker’s management a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film his popularity in japan may be compared with that of his contemporary w edwards deming peter drucker also wrote a book in  called the essential drucker it is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of peter druckers work on management the information gathered is a collection from his previous findings the practice of management  to management challenges for the st century  this book offers in druckers words a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management he also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management key ideasedit drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management and several ideas run through most of his writings decentralization and simplification drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized according to drucker corporations tend to produce too many products hire employees they dont need when a better solution would be outsourcing and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid the concept of knowledge worker in his  book the landmarks of tomorrow since then knowledgebased work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide the prediction of the death of the blue collar worker the changing face of the us auto industry is a testimony to this prediction the concept of what eventually came to be known as outsourcing he used the example of front room and back room of each business a company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business back room activities should be handed over to other companies for whom these tasks are the front room activities the importance of the nonprofit sector which he calls the third sector private sector and the government sector being the first two nongovernment organizations ngos play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world a profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies a lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us from their price respect for the worker drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities he taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employees value to the organization central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organizations most valuable resource and that a managers job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so a belief in what he called the sickness of government drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need andor want though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government the chapter the sickness of government in his book the age of discontinuity formed the basis of new public management a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the s and s the need for planned abandonment businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to yesterdays successes rather than seeing when they are no longer useful a belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure the need for community early in his career drucker predicted the end of economic man and advocated the creation of a plant community where an individuals social needs could be met he later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized and by the s suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride the need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals rather than subordinating an institution to a single value this concept of management by objectives and selfcontrol forms the keynote of his  landmark the practice of management a companys primary responsibility is to serve its customers profit is not the primary goal but rather an essential condition for the companys continued existence and sustainability a belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankinds noblest inventions “do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed” in the s by drucker the slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy drucker began explaining

fame for his outstanding work in the field criticism of druckers workedit the wall street journal researched several of his lectures in  and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts drucker was off the mark for example when he told an audience that english was the official language for all employees at japan’s mitsui trading company drucker’s defense “i use anecdotes to make a point not to write history” and while he was known for his prescience he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts he predicted for instance that the nation’s financial center would shift from new york to washington others maintain that one of drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively critic dale krueger said that the system is

natural causes at  druckers wife doris died in october  at the age of  work and philosophyedit early influencesedit among druckers early influences was the austrian economist joseph schumpeter a friend of his realized that keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities” drucker wrote “while i was interested in the behavior of people” over the next  years drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings as opposed to the crunching of numbers his books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him “i have been saying for many years” drucker once remarked “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline” as a young writer drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative german philosopher friedrich julius stahl and another called “the jewish question in germany” — that were burned and banned by the nazis the business thinkeredit druckers career as a business thinker took off in  when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of general motors gm one of the largest companies in the world at that time his experiences in europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority he shared his fascination with donaldson brown the mastermind behind the administrative controls at gm in  brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a political audit a twoyear socialscientific analysis of the corporation drucker attended every board meeting interviewed employees and analyzed production and decisionmaking processes the resulting book concept of the corporation popularized gms multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles consulting engagements and additional books gm however was hardly thrilled with the final product drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to reexamine a host of longstanding policies on customer relations dealer relations employee relations and more inside the corporation drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical gms revered chairman alfred sloan was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist” drucker later recalled “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence” drucker taught that management is “a liberal art” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history sociology psychology philosophy culture and religion he also believed strongly that all institutions including those in the private sector have a responsibility to the whole of society “the fact is” drucker wrote in his  management tasks responsibilities practices “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers if the managers of our major institutions and especially of business do not take responsibility for the common good no one else can or will” drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands he was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress drucker analyzed it and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run his approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century by that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production executives thought they knew how to run companies and drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs lest organizations become stale but he did so in a sympathetic way he assumed that his readers were intelligent rational hardworking people of good will if their organizations struggled he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas a narrow conception of problems or internal misunderstandings drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management he became legendary among many of postwar japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their wartorn homeland he advised the heads of general motors sears general electric wr grace and ibm among many others over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the american red cross and the salvation army his advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the adela investment company a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of latin america druckers writingsedit druckers  books have been translated into more than thirtysix languages two are novels one an autobiography he is the coauthor of a book on japanese painting and made eight series of educational films on management topics he also penned a regular column in the wall street journal for  years and contributed frequently to the harvard business review the atlantic monthly and the economist his work is especially popular in japan even more so after the publication of what if the female manager of a highschool baseball team read drucker’s management a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film his popularity in japan may be compared with that of his contemporary w edwards deming peter drucker also wrote a book in  called the essential drucker it is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of peter druckers work on management the information gathered is a collection from his previous findings the practice of management  to management challenges for the st century  this book offers in druckers words a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management he also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management key ideasedit drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management and several ideas run through most of his writings decentralization and simplification drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized according to drucker corporations tend to produce too many products hire employees they dont need when a better solution would be outsourcing and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid the concept of knowledge worker in his  book the landmarks of tomorrow since then knowledgebased work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide the prediction of the death of the blue collar worker the changing face of the us auto industry is a testimony to this prediction the concept of what eventually came to be known as outsourcing he used the example of front room and back room of each business a company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business back room activities should be handed over to other companies for whom these tasks are the front room activities the importance of the nonprofit sector which he calls the third sector private sector and the government sector being the first two nongovernment organizations ngos play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world a profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies a lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us from their price respect for the worker drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities he taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employees value to the organization central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organizations most valuable resource and that a managers job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so a belief in what he called the sickness of government drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need andor want though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government the chapter the sickness of government in his book the age of discontinuity formed the basis of new public management a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the s and s the need for planned abandonment businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to yesterdays successes rather than seeing when they are no longer useful a belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure the need for community early in his career drucker predicted the end of economic man and advocated the creation of a plant community where an individuals social needs could be met he later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized and by the s suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride the need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals rather than subordinating an institution to a single value this concept of management by objectives and selfcontrol forms the keynote of his  landmark the practice of management a companys primary responsibility is to serve its customers profit is not the primary goal but rather an essential condition for the companys continued existence and sustainability a belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankinds noblest inventions “do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed” in the s by drucker the slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as  in his wall street journal wsj article entitled “sell the mailroom” in  by way of recognition drucker was posthumously inducted into the outsourcing hall of fame for his outstanding work in the field criticism of druckers workedit the wall street journal researched several of his lectures in  and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts drucker was off the mark for example when he told an audience that english was the official language for all employees at japan’s mitsui trading company drucker’s defense “i use anecdotes to make a point not to write history” and while he was known for his prescience he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts he predicted for instance that the nation’s financial center would shift from new york to washington others maintain that one of drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively critic dale krueger said that the system is difficult to implement and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control as opposed to fostering creativity to meet their goals druckers classic concept of the corporation criticized general motors at a time when it was in some ways the most successful corporation in the world many of gms executives considered drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward alfred p sloan refrained from personal hostility toward drucker but even sloan considered druckers critiques of gms management to be dead wrong awards and honorsedit drucker was awarded the presidential medal of freedom by us president george w bush on july   he also received honors from the governments of austria including the grand silver medal for services to the republic of austria in  the grand gold decoration for services to the republic of austria in  and the austrian cross of honour for science and art st class in  and japan order of the sacred treasure rd class  june  drucker was the honorary chairman of

widely as the father of management peter drucker formulated many concepts about business that we now take for granted on the th anniversary of his birth we take a look at druckers contributions from a to z by leigh buchanan leigh buchanan is an editoratlarge for inc magazine a former editor at harvard business review and founding editor of webmaster magazine she writes regular columns on leadership and workplace culture leighebuchanan editoratlarge inc magazineleighebuchanan  comments credit the drucker institute claremont graduate university the drucker institute claremont graduate university peter drucker was known to gently chide ambitious acolytes to replace their pursuit of success with the pursuit of contribution certainly few people contributed as much to twentieth century business social and political thought as drucker who was born  years agoon november  in a suburb of vienna known widely as the father of management drucker immigrated to the united states in  in a career that produced  books as well as lectures classes consultations and even movies drucker anatomized the functioning and dysfunctioning of companies it would be easier to list the ideas he didnt promulgate in some form than those he did as far as we know he never weighed in on secret santa or pets in the workplace much of the business lexicon bruited about in officesfrom knowledge worker to management by objectivecan be traced to druckerian coinage for decades harried ceos have restructured their work lives based on druckers almost zen insights about efficiency and time management his pronouncements on customers marketing and profitability deserve to be framed and hung in every corner office to remind business leaders where their priorities should lie encountering drucker for the first time readers may dismiss as obvious his observations on subjects like motivating workers and encouraging innovation but such observations were far from obvious when drucker first made them and if they seem so now it is because his wisdom and clarity compelled so many companies to act as he advised what i find is that whenever i think i have got a really creative idea if i go back to peters books i always find he already said it first said oneminute manager author ken blanchard during a celebration of the centary at claremont universitys peter f drucker and masatoshi ito graduate school of management drucker had the ears of ceos heads of state and major philanthropists corporate titans like general electric and toyota were swayed by his ideas drucker gave us the language the metaphor the lens the understanding of the role of management as the critical function said good to great author jim collins at the claremont event in honor of the centenary we have compiled an alphabetical list of some people places and concepts drawn from the life and works of drucker abandonment jim collins earns applause when he lectures about his stop doing list jack welch gained fame for shedding businesses in which general electric wasnt first or second but it was drucker who first suggested that choosing what not to do was a decision as strategic as its opposite druckers theory of purposeful abandonment exhorted business leaders to quickly sever projects policies and processes that had outlived their usefulness the first step in a growth policy is not to decide where and how to grow he told author jeffrey krames in  it is to decide what to abandon in order to grow a business must have a systematic policy to get rid of the outgrown the obsolete the unproductive bystander though he bestrode the management world like a colossus drucker was less assuming than many of todays megawattage gurus an early advocate of servant leadership he both valued and practiced humility describing himself as a bystander who is on the stage but not part of the action even his quasiautobiography adventures of a bystander refracts druckers life through the stories of people he had known such as sigmund freud and henry luce customers having trouble formulating a mission statement let drucker boil it down for you the purpose of business is to create and keep a customer he argued and what does our customer find valuable is the most important question companies can ask themselves this focus helped reorient marketing away from advertising and onto a higher plane decentralization little fish learn to be big fish in little ponds drucker favored decentralized organizations because they create small pools in which employees gain satisfaction by witnessing the fruits of their efforts and nascent leaders can make mistakes without bringing down the business when drucker laid out these ideas in the mids the commandandcontrollers who dominated corporations were not amused today of course stovepipe organizationsthose that remainare widely maligned for their failure to make the most of human and information resources effectiveness perhaps the most revelatory insight in the history of time management tore the bottom out of frederick taylors timeandmotion studies efficiency is doing things right drucker wrote in the effective executive effectiveness is doing the right things whats true for individual managers is also true for organizations which often squander time and resources trying to improve processes for products not worth producing the solution see abandonment above future drucker dismissed attempts to label him a futurist insisting that the best way to predict the future is to create it and the only thing we know about the future is that it will be different still his forecasting tended to be spoton among other things he anticipated the rise of japan the importance of computers and the backlash against executive pay his method was to study significant events that had already occurred and had predictable effects going forward or to use druckers elegant oxymoron the future that has already happened general motors druckers concept of the corporation  was arguably the first drop in what would become a deluge of organizational and management studies the corporation in question was gm to which drucker was given the kind of access for which todays business scholars would sell their grandmas up the river druckers conclusions about corporate structure and management style and their effect on worker productivity and morale were enormously influentialalthough they so annoyed thenceo alfred sloan that he pretended the book didnt exist hitler druckers first book the end of economic man was a study not of management but of totalitarianism living in germany during hitlers rise two pamphlets he wroteone praising a germanjewish philosopher and one roundly condemning the national socialistswere banned and burned by the nazis drucker was achingly aware of the worst government and society could dish out his later writing can be interpreted as a lifelong quest for functional principled institutions innovation thomas edison would get no pushback from drucker on his  percent inspirationpercentperspiration formula drucker believed that innovationthe specific function of entrepreneurshipmust be methodically ferreted out and he posited seven likely places to find it in unexpected occurrences incongruities process needs new knowledge demographics perceptions and changes in industries and markets the crucial characteristic of innovators is focus even thomas edison drucker pointed out worked only in the electrical field japan the japanese found much to love about drucker in the s as industrial giants like toyota embraced his theories on the primacy of employees and ideas about marketinga comparably nascent discipline there the admiration was mutual with drucker praising such japanese practices as lifetime employment though he later conceded the need for greater flexibility and deliberative decisionmaking followed by quick action among druckers great passions was japanese art which he both collected and lectured on extensively knowledge workers the term knowledge management has that pc era smell but almost  years before the founding of microsoft drucker coined the term knowledge worker to describe the growing cadre of employees who labored with their brains rather than their hands drucker explained that knowledge workers require a new style of management that treats them more as volunteers or partners than as subordinates he predicted correctly that the ability of leaders to motivate these founts of productivitythe most valuable asset of a st century institutionwould become a cornerstone of competitive advantage lifelong learning another petersengepopularized the concept of learning organizations in the s but learning organizations are predicated on learning individuals drucker called teaching people how to learn the most pressing task for managers given the perpetual expansion of skills and knowledge that are products of the information economy he personally eschewed the designation guruwhich suggests one who counselscasting himself rather as a student true to form drucker every year assigned himself a topic about which he knew nothing and made it the subject of intense study marketing drucker was born in  the same year that henry ford famously declared any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black druckers theories of marketingthe distinguishing unique function of businessamount to an extended refutation of that attitude the aim of marketing in druckers view was to know and understand the customer so well that the product or service fits him and sells itself innovation which drucker considered the other basic function of business is responsible for the creation of those selfselling products nonprofits whats better than a run on thin mints being declared the bestrun organization in america by the worlds preeminent business thinker in  drucker bestowed that encomium on the girl scouts usa one of many nonprofits with which he worked closely over the years others included the american heart association and the salvation army drucker was a passionate proponent of the social and economic importance of nonprofits which he deemed the most distinguishing feature of american society he created a set of management principles specifically for that sector and urged businesses to draw lessons in establishing a mission and motivating workers from the nonprofit world objectives in the daily scrum of business employees become so focused on what theyre doing they forget why theyre doing it and off the rails they go in the process of management  drucker called this the activity trap and proposed management by objective as a way to avoid it with mbo employees participate in setting goals and are then evaluated on how they fulfill those goals managers can focus on the what rather than the how management by objective worksif you know the objective drucker wrote ninety percent of the time you dont profitability drucker was all for profitbut not for profit maximization he viewed healthy margins as a necessary condition for the social good of wealth creation yet profits are not the purpose of an organization but rather a constraint not the reason to behave in a particular way but rather a test of whether the business is behaving appropriately if archangels instead of businessmen sat in the directors chairs they would still have to be concerned with profitability despite their total lack of interest in making profits questions in effective organizations employees know their roles and drucker was acutely aware of his my job is to ask questions he once informed a consulting client according to an article in business week its your job to provide answers in this socratic style drucker inspired a generation of business leaders to wax introspective about their organizations any journey of selfexploration he believed should begin with five essential questions what is our mission who is our customer what does the customer value what are our results what is our plan respect for more than  years drucker preached that workers are assets not liabilities and should be treated with respect pick up your daily dilbert or watch an episode of the office then judge how persuasive he was drucker reimagined the organization as a human community and the job of management as preparing people to perform and then getting out of their way that attitude wasnt just nice given that knowledge skills are more portable than manual ones it was also smart the management of knowledge workers should be based on the assumption that the corporation needs them more than they need the corporation schumpeter drucker really understood entrepreneurs an appreciation spawned in part by the work of austrian economist joseph schumpeter schumpeter introduced the idea of creative destruction the necessary collateral damage that occurs when entrepreneurswhom he called wild spiritsbreach established markets entrepreneurs drive progress and create wealth schumpeter believed a mantra drucker took up in his own copious writings on innovation the entrepreneur always searches for change responds to it and exploits it as an opportunity drucker wrote time managementtime is the scarcest resource and unless it is managed nothing else can be managedin a sense much of druckers writing about effective organizations boils down to time management if time is the insurmountable constraint deciding how to use it becomes is the most strategic of decisions on a more personal level drucker suggested managers measure how they spend their time and compare that with how they should be spending it then make the requisite modifications his overarching question what needs to be done right now for the business universals drucker faulted business literature for raising performance expectations unrealistically high demanding that managers be mathematical and creative adept at decisionmaking and analysis and in possession of excellent people skills and a firm grasp of organizational dynamics what seems to be wanted is universal genius and universal genius has always been in short supply he observed the experience of the human race indicates strongly that the only person in abundant supply is the universal incompetent vienna drucker grew up in a small suburb of the city named dobling where his parentsa government official and a doctorhosted soirees for scientists and intellectuals living near the starry seat of the hapsburg monarchy the family was able to attract prominent economists and political philosophers like joseph schumpeter friedrich august von hayek and ludwig heinrich edler von mises whose conversation instilled in drucker a lifelong curiosity and interest in ideas welch the chemical combustion that birthed neutron jack welch was set off in a meeting with drucker in  drucker posed two questions to welch who had just been named general electrics ceo if you werent already in this business would you enter it today and if not what are you going to do about it those questions inspired welchs dramatic restructuring of general electric including the elimination of many lowgrowth businesses and  positions from there welch rebuilt ge into a hugely successful marketleading corporation with an employeedevelopment program ambitious enough even for drucker xray how do you know when its time for the next next new thing in managing for results  drucker introduced the concept of a business xraya tool for determining innovation strategies companies use the xray to evaluate the life cycles of their existing offerings they then identify the gap between those offerings expected future performance and their own larger goals finally they fill that gap withwhat elseinnovation the entrepreneurial achievement must be large enough to fill that gap and timely enough to fill it before the old becomes obsolescent drucker wrote yardsticks with his emphasis on results drucker was bullish on metrics but he worried that managers often measure the wrong things for example things unrelated to the leaders desired outcome or that they measure too much or that they express their measurements in the wrong way when evaluating management effectiveness he touted one metric or yardstick as he often it above others that yardstick productivity which drucker defined as the degree to which resources are utilized and their yield zen in  when the writer harriet rubin interviewed drucker at his home for inc he showed her this passage from a book on japanese art the zeninspired painter seeks the truth of a landscape like that of religion in sudden enlightenment this allows no time for careful detailed draftsmanship after long contemplation he is expected to be able to seize inner truth in a swordlike stroke of the brush similarly drucker achieved enlightenment through quiet observation waiting patiently until he saw an idea whole then rendering universal truth in the swift space of a sentence thus was the essence of the master published on nov
