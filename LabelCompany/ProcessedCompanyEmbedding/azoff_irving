reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo irving azoff credit nathaniel wood for the new york times los angeles — in the music business an artist’s personal manager is usually a behindthescenes figure the negotiator and taskmaster unseen by the general publicand then there is irving azoff the bombastic supermanager of the eagles steely dan van halen christina aguilera and other stars who made his reputation in the s by securing topdollar deals for his clients his behavior was so outrageous that rolling stone sent cameron crowe to write a profile of him in one oftrepeated anecdote he once used a chain saw to cut through a hotel room wallthose antics are now well behind mr azoff  who on sunday will be honored with a salute to industry icons award as part of the annual pregrammy gala hosted by clive davis but mr azoff — who in addition to his career as a powerful manager is a former chairman of mca and more recently live nation — remains one of the music world’s most outspoken figures capable of igniting the industry with a barbed post on twitteron a sunny afternoon this week in his office here mr azoff surrounded by memorabilia — including a pair of bobbleheads depicting mr azoff and joe walsh of the eagles — spoke about problems facing the music industry today the last days of the eagles’ glenn frey who died in january at  and the pride he feels in his son jeffrey who recently took over the management of harry styles from one direction here are edited excerpts from that conversation continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q you’ve been named an industry “icon” what does that mean to youa to my knowledge this is the first time they’ve given this award to a manager it’s always been a sitting record company president or the head of a music publishing company or something so i thought it was important the grammys are expanding their definition of icons in the music businessi think we’re at a key crossroads in the business thousands of people have lost their jobs and despite higher consumption of music the monetization of it has gone to hell so i’m hoping that this signifies a moment when everybody — labels publishers artists managers — are all in the same boat and can really do something about itq what needs to be donea it’s very clear that the economics of streaming haven’t helped creators and i don’t think that when president clinton signed the law that led to safe harbor the digital millennium copyright act that there was any intention for the tech companies to hide behind it the way that they currently do advertisement continue reading the main story none of us in the music business have enough resources to fight the legal battles against these big tech companies the best thing would be to change lawsq after you set up global music rights your new performingrights organization a few years ago one of the first things you did was go after youtubea when i started gmr i was looking for a business opportunity that could better somebody’s plight and performing rights were the most outrageous and egregious of bad treatment to the creative community every year i was sitting here looking at statements on major writers that were going down down down at a time when consumption of music was going up up upyoutube is an ongoing negotiation but i’ve stepped out of it and allowed my team to handle it themselves because i’m too angryq you have a famously combative reputation there’s no shortage of old photos of you sticking up your middle finger newsletter

you show me a manager that’s never gotten into a fight i’ll show you someone that’s badly represented their artisti think passion is good in this era when you’re dealing with these tech companies they are worth zillions of dollars more than the net worth of the entire music industry i just don’t know why they have to be so heavyhandedq you’ve run major record companies and been the chairman of live nation why is artist management the job that you always come back toa i think it’s what i’m best at and where i can make the most difference and if you are a fan of music which i am and a fan of the music business which i am you better have respect for the people with the creative talent because without them none of us would be here advertisement continue reading the main story q recently it was announced that guns n’ roses would be reuniting for coachella you once briefly managed the band and axl rose said that you had tried to pressure him into reuniting the original groupa i would never go to an artist and say “i want you to reunite” if he had asked me if i thought it was a good idea i would have said yes but by the way nobody tells axl to do anything he does what he wants to doslash and duff mckagan are terrific people axl is a complicated individual that i wish nothing but success for i think this is a good historical moment that the public deserves to see i hope it happensq what was it like for you when glenn frey died he had been your client for more than  yearsa it was more like losing a brother first and then a trusted personal friend and a client third it was hard really hard i was pretty forthcoming in the statement that he died from complications of rheumatoid arthritis acute ulcerative colitis and pneumonia but there’s been all this speculation over what role if any the drugs he was taking had in it when you go on tv and you think why are there  seconds to this drug ad and then  seconds of disclaimers but the reason those disclaimers are up there is that it obviously happens to people it just happened to glennthe eagles’ career was on an upward spiral as was fleetwood mac another client and steely dan things from that era that still sound great live they were just getting bigger and bigger glenn always said “the first time we went out on a high and when we stop touring the second time it’s going to be the same thing”we didn’t intend for it to end this way but you couldn’t write the script for how to have it end any bigger continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think grammy awards

percent of the time currently spent watching music videos on youtube would be spent on similar or lowervalue channels — the reaction was strong and possibly the strongest ontherecord reaction came not surprisingly from veteran artist manager irving azoff a longtime youtube critic who wrote an open letter directed at the platform a year ago “my report about the ‘value of youtube to the music industry’ would be really brief because i can summarize the benefit of youtube to artists in a word none” he told hits “they say without youtube users would look for sites that paid even less for music — i say good luck finding services that benefit so greatly from music and pay so little “google’s alphabet has a market cap of  billion and youtube itself is worth somewhere north of  billion—a value it acquired in large part on the backs of music artists” he continued “but they’d rather spend their money on dishonest studies to justify their measly payments than offer creators what they deserve for the use of their work” and another thing — “the truth is that despite having to compete with services like youtube who hide behind outdated safe harbor protections legitimate services like spotify and apple music are attracting more subscribers than ever” he continued “if youtube had the same level of commitment their subscription service would be more than a head fake—and they’d be working hard like spotify does to convert users to the paid tier for unlimited music maybe google should do a study on that” source link search for product categoriesselect a category books

yank  songs from youtube exclusive  hollywood reporter the hollywood reporter november   pm pt by eriq gardner irving azoff threatens to yank  songs from youtube exclusive jeffrey mayeruniversal music group the industry heavyweight representing pharrell williams and others believes that youtube hasnt made all necessary deals for its new subscription service and is prepared to take his clients off of the youtube ecosystem many works composed by popular musicians including the eagles pharrell williams boston foreigner john lennon smokey robinson chris cornell and george and ira gershwin could soon be removed from youtube on wednesday just as google announced the coming launch of youtube music key its muchanticipated subscription service that will compete with spotify and pandora music industry heavyweight irving azoff told the hollywood reporter that he is prepared to take  of his clients representing some  copyrighted works away from the youtube ecosystem including the new music key the move is a huge shot across googles bow perhaps even more significant than taylor swifts muchdiscussed decision a week ago to remove her songs from spotify over doubts about royalties azoff is the former chairman of live nation who is now spearheading a new venture global music rights gmr aimed at extracting higher performance rights royalties for songwriters traditionally those rights have been handled by ascap and bmi which have been hamstrung by consent decrees with the justice department that requires a license be given whenever an outlet requests it although the doj is currently reviewing the consent decrees azoff is moving quickly and has a message that appeals to many songwriters as consumers gravitate more and more to streaming services in lieu of purchasing music these services should be contributing more compensation to the ones who compose the music the way fans listen to music is evolving daily says azoff gmr is going to give songwriters and publishers an opportunity to engage in meaningful licensing for their intellectual property the trampling of writers rights in the digital marketplace without any regard to their contribution to the creative process will no longer be tolerated the big record labels have already made deals with youtube owned by google but earlier this year controversy erupted when smaller independent labels reacted negatively to the licensing terms being offered at one point there was even speculation that works from adele the white stripes radiohead and vampire weekend would be blocked from youtube but in the last  hours came reports that merlin representing thousands of small labels around the world had come to terms with youtube those deals would only cover sound recording rights though which have traditionally brought in the bulk of revenue from digital services the owners of songwriter or publishing rights on the other hand have long struggled to see significant compensation from digital services in past years publishers have employed a variety of strategies to rectify this — suing over novelties like ringtones and targeting youtube specifically for allowing users to embed videos with music most recently the publisher war against youtube has been fairly quiet — with ascap and bmi making deals with the online video service — instead focusing its attention on pandora universal and sony have made direct deals with pandora which is currently in the midst of a dispute over rates with song publishers but not everyone has forgotten about youtube which according to a recent nielsen survey is more popular among teenagers for music than radio irving azoff certainly has not forgotten randy grimmett who works with azoff at global music rights points to publisher deals with pandora and says the same thing needs to happen as far as youtube is concerned he says theres no business to be built upon unlicensed works and adds that there needs to be parity between the songwriters side and the record owners side of the industry unlike ascap and bmi and the publishers they represent azoff and grimmett have more negotiating leverage for doing direct deals with digital services and so on tuesday they are going public in an attempt to get youtube to acknowledge that more licensing work needs to be done we will update with any response from youtube email email protected twitter

lawsuit  billboard billboard irving azoffs global music rights files motion to dismiss rmlcs antitrust lawsuit  by ed christman facebook twitter email me print comments nathaniel woodgetty images portraits irving azoff photographed on march   in los angeles  azoff recently likened radio to a cartel conspiring to keep songwriter payments low global music rights as expected has filed a motion to dismiss the radio music licensing committee’s antitrust lawsuit against the performance rights organization in the us eastern district court of pennsylvaniathe court document filed by o’melveny  myers llp and harkins cunningham llp on behalf of gmr on jan  says that the court where rmlc filed its lawsuit lacks personal jurisdiction and is an improper forum in which to adjudicate the dispute and notes that the rmlc complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be grantedon the first point the gmr filing points out that neither the defendant or plaintiff are located in pennsylvania where the suit was initially filed on nov  gmr responded by filing its own antitrust lawsuit against the rmlc alleging it is acting like a cartel in the us central district court of california if the pennsylvania case is not going to be dismissed and must be adjudicated the latest filing states that the case should be in the us central district of california court because that’s where gmr is located and the only licensing negotiations that happened in person occurred there and rmlc also has twice has many member radio stations in california than it does in pennsylvania according to the documentonce again gmr founded by renowned artist manager irving azoff in  and headed by former ascap executive randy grimmett makes the case that it is much smaller than the plaintiff and that if anyone is wielding antitrust practices it is the rmlc for one gmr only handles  songwriters which combined have a share in  songsincluding ones by by the eagles metallica onerepublic drake pharrell williams and john lennonand which only make up oneeightt of  of all songs available for radio to play and its songs only get between to  of all radio play in contrast the rmlc members combined own about  radio stations that generate about  of us terrestrial radio revenueit charges that the rmlc is trying to impose a compulsory licensing scheme with a rate court as if gmr had a consent decree from the dept of justice which regulates two of its much larger competitors bmi and ascap in addition the rmlc filed a similar lawsuit in  against the fourth us performance rights organization sesac which agreed to a settlement that includes arbitration if the two sides cant negotiate a feesince the rmlc insisted on those terms gmr tried to negotiate directly with rmlc members but was only successful in cutting a deal with iheartmedia the largest terrestrial radio network in the us and with townsquare which according to its website owns  radio stations in  marketscontrary to the rmlc charges gmr asserts that as a new pro it is creating more competition especially for songwriters moreover the gmr documents points out that its conduct won’t harm the consumer ie the radio listening public since terrestrial radio is already free to listen to while the two sides are involved in litigation there appears to be ongoing dialog on christmas eve for an undisclosed fee gmr offered a temporarily license that needs to be signed by jan  that would allow radio to continue to playing gr songs through sept   with each party reserving the right to seek a retroactive fee adjustment that proposed adjustment would depend on a future licensing agreement the outcome of the antitrust litigation or a possible settlement between the rmlc and gmraccording to the initial lawsuit gmr is seeking  million combined for the  radio stations to license its music for a year any station that signs the interim license agreement by jan  and pays the applicable interim license fee will not be subject to copyright infringement claims while the interim license is in effecton jan  the rmlc issued a letter to its broadcasters saying that the wording used by gmr in sending out the interim license “incorrectly asserts that the fee was ‘negotiated’ with the rmlc although the radio group concedes that it did work with gmr to help it offer its members the temporary license negotiation is a mischaracterization according to the rmlc which characterizes the arrangement as nonnegotiable a take it or leave it proposition fro the gmr secondly according to the rmlc the letter with the interim license from gmr incorrectly states that the fees to each station was calculated by the radio group the rmlc said it wasn’t involved or “would ever entertain any involvement whatsoever in gmr’s final fee calculations” according to the radio group letter to its members“the rmlc believes that these gmr representations as the level of the rmlc involvement with their interim license offering borders on bad faith at the very least and are intended to lend an rmlc stamp of approval to the processwhile the interim license fee was initially undisclosed gmr was trying to secure industry payments totaling  million per month for the temporary license according to that letter the rmlc letter says it is not disparaging or recommending gmr’s interim license offerthe following day gmr responded to the rmlc letter with its own letter to rmlc stations“the interim license was the product of weeks of negotiations proposals and counterproposals between gmr and rmlc” according to a copy of that letter “despite this documented history the rmlc issued yesterday a statement on its website claiming it did not negotiate the  monthly fee or your company’s allocation of that fee both statements are categorically false”while the two parties were involved in longterm negotiations the rmlc proposed a oneyear deal that would pay out about  million or  million per month from the stations that abided by the rmlc negotiations  gmr made a counter proposal of  million or  million a month which the rmlc rejected and then filed the lawsuitdespite the lawsuit gmr said it was willing to still offer a temporary license at its last rate “in the course of our ensuing negotiations the rmlc prepared and sent to gmr a detailed spreadsheet allocating the  million among each member of the rmlc” according to the gmr letter “the interim license fees that we sent to each of you over the weekend were taken directly from the rlmcs spreadsheet  in addition the interim license itself was reviewed revised and approved by the rmlc and its counsel  all of this is documented  the rmlc’s contrary statements are inexcusable and counterproductive” facebook twitter email me print

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
