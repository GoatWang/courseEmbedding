by janelle from diminished quality glad press n seal used to be the best product on the market for wrapping food now we cant get the wrap to tear off without it being an uneven mess and eventually were unable to get it to unroll at all last night i heard my husband wrestling with something in the kitchen minutes later he handed me the product and told me to mail it back to glad and to ask them what were supposed to do with this mess i chose this route because i didnt want to spend any more money on this date published  rated  out of  by mj from new plastic cutter edge is horrible i have used pressn seal for years and used to love it it is the only wrap product we use i have literally had multiple conversations with various friends during which i told them that pressn seal is far superior to traditional plastic wrap however we noticed that you changed the cutter to tear off a piece of wrap to a flimsy plastic cutter its horrible please change it to a better quality metal one the plastic edge does not cut through the pressn seal so you end up trying to force the wrap to tear then it wrinkles and sticks to itself awful im not sure if this was poorly thought out costsavings idea or if some nut claimed that the metal edge is too dangerous but you have got to fix this we will sadly no longer be using your product if it continues to have the pathetic plastic cutter date published  rated  out of  by brian from threw it away i bought this product because it sounded similar to saran wrap and the store was out of the regular cling wrap i used it once to wrap some left over chicken and i needed a chisel to get the food out of the wrap the next day tonight i was going to try to wrap some left over chicken i guess the roll decided to seal itself because i could not find the end i tried for a long time and then tried to loosen with the tip of a sharp knife no luck anyway i tried and i finally gave us after  frustrating minutes it is going in the garbage now that i took a picture for you i am a  year old male who does all the cooking and everything else for a disabled wife and this product did not make things better for me i have used glad products for the last  years but i will go back to something easier to use i regret that i paid about  for this product and had to throw it out date published  rated  out of  by wisconsin from love glad press in seal i was wondering if there is any larger quantities of this product like for food service and a better dispenser would be awesome too date published  press’n seal ® reviews  page  y m d h bvseobulk

product very annoying probably will not buy again date published  rated  out of  by hop a long from many uses i recently had surgery and used presss seal to wrap my foot to keep the incision dry when showering it worked fantastic pressn seal is not justfor the kitchen date published  rated  out of  by biglou from tearable dispenser love the product but the dispenser is by far the most useless container i have ever come across glads lack of engineering or design shows when you try to use the useless jagged edge of a piece of cardboard as a cutting divice for the wrap you end up with trash when ever you try to rip it across that useless design date published  rated  out of  by kfisher from dispenser is a disaster product provides great seal but the dispenser is so terrible i avoid using the product surely you can engineer a dispenser that doesnt fall apart and works reliably would only recommend this product with huge warning to prepare for frustration date published  rated  out of  by janelle from diminished quality glad press n seal used to be the best product on the market for wrapping food now we cant get the wrap to tear off without it being an uneven mess and eventually were unable to get it to unroll at all last night i heard my husband wrestling with something in the kitchen minutes later he handed me the product and told me to mail it back to glad and to ask them what were supposed to do with this mess i chose this route because i didnt want to spend any more money on this date published  rated  out of  by mj from new plastic cutter edge is horrible i have used pressn seal for years and used to love it it is the only wrap product we use i have literally had multiple conversations with various friends during which i told them that pressn seal is far superior to traditional plastic wrap however we noticed that you changed the cutter to tear off a piece of wrap to a flimsy plastic cutter its horrible please change it to a better quality metal one the plastic edge does not cut through the pressn seal so you end up trying to force the wrap to tear then it wrinkles and sticks to itself awful im not sure if this was poorly thought out costsavings idea or if some nut claimed that the metal edge is too dangerous but you have got to fix this we will sadly no longer be using your product if it continues to have the pathetic plastic cutter date published  rated  out of  by brian from threw it away i bought this product because it sounded similar to saran wrap and the store was out of the regular cling wrap i used it once to wrap some left over chicken and i needed a chisel to get the food out of the wrap the next day tonight i was going to try to wrap some left over chicken i guess the roll decided to seal itself because i could not find the end i tried for a long time and then tried to loosen with the tip of a sharp knife no luck anyway i tried and i finally gave us after  frustrating minutes it is going in the garbage now that i took a picture for you i am a  year old male who does all the cooking and everything else for a disabled wife and this product did not make things better for me i have used glad products for the last  years but i will go back to something easier to use i regret that i paid about  for this product and had to throw it out date published  rated  out of  by wisconsin from love glad press in seal

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
