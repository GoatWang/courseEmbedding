thank you patti and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal  earnings call i will begin my remarks with an overview of our third quarter results as follows total net revenues for the third quarter was about  million this represents an increase of  from the prior year period this was a record q for netsol and we are on track to deliver record revenues for the third consecutive year in fiscal  our adjusted ebitda was  million in the third quarter and net income was  in q or  earnings per share from an overall market perspective we continue to see solid demand for our solution across our geographic footprint and we are executing well with both new and existing customers we remain excited and very optimistic about netsols future growth prospects and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant long term growth opportunity in the global finance and leasing industry at the same time we remain intensely indiscernible our goal of driving margin expansion and increasing our earnings per share growth looking closer at the fiscal q results we delivered a strong quarter for nfs ascent license and services revenue driven primarily by our large country contract we remain on track with this multiyear multicountry implementation and we continue to be pleased with our progress with this important client on the other side our legacy nfs revenue was softer than we expected in the third quarter several of our clients are now beginning to explore with us their migration path from legacy nfs to nfs ascent which has resulted in a greater than expected slowdown in nfs license and services revenues especially in asiapacific or china to be more specific we believe this tactical shift in our clients demand towards ascent from our legacy solutions represents a significant longterm opportunity for us as we believe our existing client portfolio represents the most immediate and logical new growth opportunity for our nfs ascent solution however this positive longterm trend is also impacting our results in the nearterm contributing to our reduced fiscal year  guidance that roger will discuss later in the call while we are tracking below are prior  expectations as i look ahead the momentum we are noticing in terms of global demand for our solutions suite the progress were making in our sales and marketing executions for nfs ascent and the advancement of our cost efficiency program gives me confidence in our ability to drive improved revenue and earnings growth in the years ahead i like to now discuss with you some trend and highlights we are noticing in a business which support our very positive outlook for netsol beginning with our largest market asiapacific this is currently our most active market in terms of new nfs ascent opportunities in china we are beginning to see a meaningful pickup in interest and increased activity from our existing nfs r clients who are now looking to potentially upgrade their platforms to nfs ascent to address the future needs of their rapidly expanding portfolios this trend is highly encouraging since as i mentioned earlier we believe our existing clients are the most logical and immediate opportunities for transition to nfs ascent over the mediumterm given our commanding market share with  clients including both multinationals and local tariff companies and the strength of our ascent solution we believe we are in a position of strength as the auto leasing industry continues to expand in china looking outside of china in our other apac markets such as indonesia thailand and australia we have a growing pipeline of tier  and tier  prospects for nfs ascent as well as new client opportunities for legacy product suite in indonesia for example we recently announced a fiveyear product license and maintenance service agreement with mizuho balimor finance or mbf one of indonesias largest multifinance companies for our mobile or international or pointofsale system and we were also named mbf’s preferred vendor in the region additionally during the quarter we became a member of indonesias leading financial services association giving us access to the association’s large network of lease finance companies in the country which has already led to increased interest and activity from prospects turning to the european market we are noticing a decline in new license sales of our regional lease sales solution to both new and existing clients while we continue to generate consistent maintenance and change request revenue from lease off outlook for growth is limited however we believe the european market is ready for nfs ascent to help drive future sales of nfs ascent we have realigned our european sales and marketing teams and are focusing dedicated resources towards driving increased penetration of ascent into the region in our north american market we continue to have a healthy pipeline across our solution suite while nfs ascent is still relatively new to the north american market we are quite encouraged by the traction we are noticing and we are pursuing a handful of new potential opportunities alongside the work we are going to drive ascent sales in the market we recently strengthened our lease back saas offering and did relaunch at an industry lead event which has resulted in substantial traction and lead generation for netsol finally i’m very pleased to say that we just recently went live with the nfs r solution in the mexico operations of a usbased fortune  drug manufacturing company this implementation in mexico is an exciting milestone for netsol as it opens the door to the latin american market with a strong referenceable client before moving on i would like to focus back on nfs ascent specifically overall i want to emphasize that we remain excited and highly optimistic about the longterm success of our nextgeneration platform a meaningful penetration will take time but we are seeing solid interest for multinational auto captive global equipment finance companies banks and existing customers for nfs ascent our global accent pipeline currently includes many tier  and tier  auto asset finance companies and the level of rfp which is a request for proposals activity in number of ongoing conversation were having continuously raise our level of confidence in the growth potential of this winner solution our pipeline includes both upgrades from legacy nfs to nfs ascent as well as organic opportunities from new prospects many of these potential opportunities represent multicountry multimillion dollar implementations while we are encouraged by the momentum we are noticing in our ascent pipeline at the same time we are also experiencing longer than expected sales and delivery cycles predominantly due to the complexities in the procurement process of a large client prospect however we have extensive experience working within these processes and remain confident in our success given our solid track record finally i would like to address the productivity and cost reduction initiatives that we announced on our last quarterly call and i’m pleased to say that we made strong progress on this plan and we are on track to deliver  million of cost savings in the second half of fiscal  and  million on an annualized basis beginning in fiscal  we will continue to evaluate opportunities for additional cost reduction through consolidation and streamlining our global operation with that i’d like now to turn the call over to roger almond to review our financial performance roger roger almond thank you najeeb i will begin with a review of our fiscal third quarter financial results before discussing our fiscal year  guidance i will then turn the call back to najeeb for closing remarks before opening the call for your questions total revenues for the third quarter were  million representing an increase of  yearoveryear total license fees for the third quarter were  million were then tripling the  million we delivered in the third quarter  our strong growth in the quarter primarily reflects increased license fees and the country ascent contract with our largest customer maintenance fees for the third quarter were  million an increase of  from  million in the prior year period primarily driven by new customer agreements that went live with our products during late fiscal  and into fiscal year  services revenues were  million for the fiscal third quarter a decrease of approximately  from  million in the prior year period the yearoveryear decrease in our services revenue primarily reflects a decrease in implementation services as well as lower revenue generated from our netsol innovation joint venture with one ensure ph total cost of revenues were  million for the third quarter an increase of  from the third quarter of  primarily driven by a higher salaries consultant cost and travel expenses gross profit for the third quarter was  million or  of total net revenues up  from  million or  in net revenues in the prior year period total operating expenses for the third quarter were  million an increase of  from  million in the same period last year the increase in our operating expenses primarily reflects increased spend in support of our product and solution sales effort and higher general and administrative expenses related to strategic hires which is partially offset by lower rd cost and depreciation and amortization gaap net income attributable to netsol for the fiscal third quarter  inclusive of minority interest was  million or  per diluted share compared with net income of  million or  per diluted share in the prior year period growth in our revenue and operating profit was primarily offset by higher noncontrolling interest in the third quarter  driven by a geographic mix of profits moving to our nongaap metrics adjusted ebitda was  million in the fiscal third quarter  consistent with the  million in the prior year period at march   cash and cash equivalents were  million compared with  million at june   and  million at march   before moving to our guidance i like to address the restatement of our prior financial report which is also mentioned in our earnings press release based upon our new independent auditor’s position regarding the timing of revenue recognition for our complex country nfs ascent contract we will amend our financial statements for the first and second quarters of fiscal  and fiscal  to be clear the revisions related to the timing of when the revenue should have been realized and not the revenue itself is based primarily upon our auditor’s position on revenue recognition for this complex contract which differs from our prior methodology importantly the impact from these revisions are immaterial to our reported financial results for the year ended june   and in the nine months ended march   more specifically the net impact from the amendments to our revenue and net income for the first six months of fiscal  is zero in addition for the first six months of fiscal  ended december   the total impact of the restatement to our net revenue is a positive  and impact to our net income is a positive  further detail of the amendment can be found in our q which will be filed later today now moving on to our guidance as najeeb mentioned the slowdown in legacy nfs license and services revenues is expected to continue to impact our fiscal  second half results in addition the nonconversion of some new client contracts that we expected to materialize in the second half of fiscal  is also having an impact on our guidance as a result we are revising our full year fiscal  guidance for net revenues down to  million to  million and our ebitda guidance range down to  million to  million with that i will now turn the call back to najeeb for some closing remarks najeeb ghauri thanks roger while we are experiencing a softer than expected fiscal  the strong fundamental longterm drive of our business remain unchanged first we are a leader in a large and growing market with significant opportunity for continued share gain especially in the highgrowth asia pacific market and in north america where we see tremendous wide space for growth second we see significant opportunities for growth driven by our industry leading nfs ascent solution as i mentioned before we are very encouraged by the momentum we are noticing in our ascent pipeline we view every single one of our major multinational client as a potential target when upgraded to nfs ascent as our clients businesses continue to grow we believe they will have a greater need to transition to our nfs ascent solution to address the need for a more robust platform that has the ability to manage much higher volumes and third our broad suite of legacy products such as lease back in north america our nfs r in few markets and apac in latin america are right for these legacy solutions our wealth of knowledge gained from working with large multinational clients our local expertise and lower cost of delivery continue to enable us to serve multiple market segments in varying stages of maturity in addition to our top line growth drivers our ongoing focus on generating additional margin expansion through organizational transformation and cost reduction initiatives will help to drive increased eps growth we will continue to carefully review our cost that is specifically focused on optimizing them in order to drive a mentality of longterm profitable growth for our business with that i like to open the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from howard halpern with taglich brothers please go ahead howard halpern good morning guys najeeb ghauri hi howard howard halpern hi in terms of you talked about the sales cycle and could you sort of break it down between i guess new potential customers and what you believe the sales cycle is for the legacy customers that are likely to convert and also in terms of that what is the potential of say half of your legacy customers would have eventually convert what is that pool of potential revenue najeeb ghauri yes thank you for asking that question i will have naeem answer that please naeem ghauri hi howard we have at least three of our existing legacy clients in china who have expressed interest not only interest we are under rfp an evaluation process and there is at least one more new prospect out of china which is also evaluating the software so between these four we are very wellpositioned the sales cycles are long as you said in the press release and the value process itself is quite stringent and there are several rounds of presentation and demonstration the workshop that go on because typically these solutions last like  years to  years and it is mission critical software so certainly they have a very very regimented procurement process to evaluate the solution so it’s hard to predict the timing on these but we are well into the rfp’s i say prudentially we are about half way through and we started about two months to three months ago so i would say we will start to make good progress by q q of next year in all of these howard halpern okay naeem ghauri and your last question was on the revenue i think that is the tough one but these are typically multimillion dollars they are very large deals one of them is at least for multiple countries for the new prospect and the others are for china at the moment but these clients are also in other markets so potentially can be multiple markets too howard halpern okay now in terms of the cost reduction that’s going on is that going to primarily be felt in the gross margin because i did see in the fourth quarter ga was up sequentially so are we really focusing here on gross margin rather than ga najeeb ghauri yes i think i will add one comment and then maybe roger can comment i think we concluded this first phase of our cost rationalization around the first quarter i mean the third quarter which was march the one we just reported so the impact of that is not showing maybe showing partly in the pl because in that period we also it is routine annual increments for the core team in lahore which is almost  of them so that is a little watch but i think as i said we are confident that by the time we finish the second half or when we report june  we would have seen at least  million of net impact from that costcutting initiative howard halpern okay i will turn it back then najeeb ghauri roger you want to add anything more on this roger almond well i think the answer to the question i think you will see it in two places but you do have the reduction of the personnel up in the  it will be part of your cost of revenue you know we look across all areas of where we could maybe have some excess fat i guess out there and we want to cut so that would be in the ga expenses also so i think at the end of the fourth quarter you will see both the cost of revenue number coming down in line and you will see some ga decrease also as we look to cut cost in both those areas howard halpern okay sounds good i’ll jump back in the queue najeeb ghauri thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from mike vermut with newland capital please go ahead mike vermut hi guys got a few questions for you here i guess kind of hitting on that same subject concerning the contracts we are currently bidding on are a lot of these competitively bid are they renewals and looking to upgrade to ascent just looking at the probability that we will be the winner on those and moving out of asia into the americas and europe what are the sizes of those deals and where are we in that process i remember a little while ago we were one of the final it sounded like one of the final bidders on the a few of them possibly and just how everything is progressing there najeeb ghauri naeem you want to answer that naeem ghauri yes sure so the one that we just mentioned in china and asia they are upgrade projects they are three of them mike they are still competitive because all major tier  companies buy their own internal compliance the procurement compels them to go to market  go to tender they cannot choose the incumbent but that’s typically the compliance internally however switching to new vendor is always a big risk and so there is a lot of hedging if they stay with the incumbent so because we have distinct advantages in understanding the data and their business and their processes and any new vendor that comes in has to have a pretty steep learning curve otherwise they cannot succeed so that’s why we are in a very very strong position but we certainly still are in a competitive landscape you know that wouldnt change there is very very few companies mike that would award a contract and that kind of value without a competitive tender mike vermut right just before we go on to americas and europe are we talking on these upgrades multiyear  million  million type contracts that were looking at here is it obviously it is not the daimler size but they are huge contracts that would kind of pad our growth for years to come if we get them naeem ghauri all the three clients we are dealing with for the upgrade they are very large volume  they would be in the tier  space in china they have hundreds of thousands of cars on these and finance so they would spend that kind of money it would be difficult for them to not do you know it is the other way around so it is very well within the  to  million for each of them and then one of them is a multiple country but they will start with china and they will want to then rollout to another seven or eight markets similar to the other contracts that we have mike vermut okay and i dont want to paint you in the corner but you would say probability because we are incumbent it’s quite high that we win these over the next  to  months najeeb ghauri well indiscernible probability a name because we have to cautious… mike vermut i didnt say probability i didnt say a number i said i high ph probability in your opinion najeeb ghauri i already said that mike we are in a very good position being the incumbent you know mike vermut great excellent okay so now europe and the americas naeem ghauri yes so europe is we are in the middle of an implementation for an sm client and we expect the go live is imminent that’s going to make us very referenceable in europe so we have been waiting for that to happen and i think the first phase should be in the month of june and we will definitely make an announcement when that happens that suddenly opens the door to a number of new potential prospects in the us we have currently two opportunities that were working on very diligently there was two others where one of the companies have decided to not go ahead with the project anywhere they just  it wasnt like we lost it to anybody else so that project is put on hold and yes we were actually at the top of the list of the four or five vendors that they had but unfortunately they have said they want to probably differ it for six months to a year so we will know then what happens the other one we are still waiting to hear so there is one that is deferred there is one were waiting to hear and there is two more which we are working on mike vermut okay and from what you see i guess what are the rough sizes of the  what kind of contracts are we talking about size wise in the us and if you can give us some color into the competitive bidding process who are the others that were out there against and how those look for us in your opinion najeeb ghauri do you want to have jeff jump in of do you want… naeem ghauri mike we don’t  jeff you can come in a second but im just going to say one point and then maybe jeff can come with more color but all of the ascent deals that we are doing were not going to do anything south of  million because we  it is a premium solution with a huge amount of rd into it and the kind of clients we are attracting would expect to spend that kind of money over  years to  years you know so we would be we would not be looking at anything less than that mike vermut great okay naeem ghauri jeff you want to say anything jeff bilbrey yes i could add to that a little bit so when we talk about these deals it might help to contextualize a little bit further a couple of them are in the finance or banking sector and over the course of a few years those are going to be worth millions of dollars probably not north of  and one of them is with a multinational auto captive and that one is definitely north of  million in terms of values so these are all active pursuits obviously can’t give names or anything like that but very active pursuits we are deep into the process again and just to add some color to what names really was you know one of those that we lost just sort of flexibility at the ascent platform so i just mentioned auto captives and banks and the one that went on hold because of an internal reorg decision and they will come back in six months or a year that was actually where the software company looking to finance their software products it is one of the top three software companies globally a brand name that we all know and we were the finalists there unfortunately before we got to put ink on paper or anything like that they did have to go quiet because of an internal reorg so we are seeing good traction in the marketplace we are seeing that the ascent platform is broad and able to go across industries and whether that’s banking finance or other specialty and so we are getting along and were hopefully going to get one of these closed here mike vermut excellent then that takes us back to  i have a couple of more for you here so based on what you see here obviously it is taking longer to close but these are large deals right so if we get a few of these closed like you said in the first second quarter we should see and with the cost savings we should see decent revenue and eps growth into  and  right if these things fall into place nothing has stagnated here najeeb ghauri no i think as i said in my prepared remarks i have looked at as quite promising mike we are quite encouraged and excited about the board outlook due to all these deal we just heard from naeem and jeff and the good thing is you are hitting more interest from our existing clients in china especially who wants to upgrade to ascent there are three or four of them and then jeff just mentioned about the north america i believe it is again a matter of timing when we can sign them when we can book them in which quarter in which part of the  first half second half time will tell i guess when we report yearend we will be in a better position to share some later at that time mike vermut excellent and then my last question this is more of a bigger picture from other research we can do here we have the best product out there i think we have the best cost structure right we have  with the engineers in lahore our cost structure probably cant be replicated is it the company and i know that there is a lot of leasing bids out there is there anything in your opinion holding it back or is it just bad timing on all of this is there anything else competitively that’s changed out there is it who we are going up against with their balance sheet is it larger competitors or is it just timing and it is just taking longer najeeb ghauri yes go ahead naeem ghauri i think the issue is not really some way the competition because from our own research mike when we embarked on the ascent program we knew what was being offered by competitors so i can tell you one thing there is not even one company out there that have invested completely organically into a new product from ground up what they have done is that they have taken the existing products and modernized them all give them a good makeover to fundamentally change architecture your tech stack and go to market with the new product it is more painstaking however the results then actually position you at a different level from your competition so we continuously meet prospects and clients who were surprised and quite frankly blown away with what they see with ascent so that’s why we are getting so much traction and some of those tier ’s which never looked at as before are inviting us to tender and i dont know whether you read the news one of our competitors which is similar size you should actually look them up in the uk there is a company called alpha i dont know if you have heard about them or not they are a similar size company and they just are going to do an ipo in june at  million sterling evaluation and their revenue  so i am just saying i believe we are grossly undervalued for whatever reasons so i think at some point we will get on the radar and then people will realize that what we have to offer is really quite compelling as opposed to some of our competitors mike vermut excellent and then one last question so the way i look at the balance sheet as these start to hit and as the large contract out there starts to build cash should start to increase on the balance sheet looking forward collection wise and then with the cost cuts coming in najeeb ghauri yes i think both will have positive impact you are absolutely right mike vermut okay so should this be a low point on the cash and then it is not  we are not in a bad position by any means but should we assume cash starts to build from here najeeb ghauri i think we got pretty good sound receivables if you look at pretty sizable receivables but also excess revenue building so we are pretty comfortable with those receivables mike vermut excellent okay all right appreciate it and good luck on these wins there i do believe it will change the dynamics of the company when they start landing najeeb ghauri sure thank you mike naeem ghauri thank you mike roger almond yes thanks mike operator operator instructions this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to najeeb for any closing remarks najeeb ghauri well thank you again for joining us today on behalf of our

successful joint venture partners i am pleased to announce on the call today the jeff will be joining netsol to lead the north america division at the present of north america and our globe initiative nfs ascent in the region and he will be hearing from later in the call now turning to our results reported earlier this morning the quarter came in had expected with continuation of multiple contract underway from our  for our entire portfolio of finance and leasing solutions importantly we remain on track there is solid finish to the year achieving our guidance and profitability objectives during the quarter we began our  million nfs ascent implementation in the uk and the country  million plus nfs ascent contract while this timing of when work began on these contracts slightly affected our service revenue on a sequential basis work is now ramping up in the current fourth quarter again we remain on track with our revenue target for the year and our confidence is our growth  in our growth trajectory is moving forward part of the confidence tends from the country ascent implementation that began in the quarter starting in south korea south africa australia and china the china accounting for the largest implementation each of these countries provides an another important reference point and our marketing efforts specially to expanding client base in china we remain very excited about the market opportunity in the country as more finance company end of the chinese market and finance and leasing of autos increased adoption something highlighted in the past calls according to our recent report about the china markets millennials those born in the s and s are increasingly turning forward financial products for purchasing cars with the penetration rate of those who have either finance or lease expected to reach  in the country by  exceeding  trillion rmb that compares to a penetration rate in the low teens today that is a large growth this translates to increased needs to our customers and ultimately higher value projects as customers are prospect manage more contracts on our system this is also one reason why it is important for us to continue to penetrate the european and north american markets where nearly every financials or leases versus space all cash or purchases without our expanded team in europe and soon to be expanded to even north america we are focused on capturing market share and helping our clients improve their productivity and consolidate it systems and create new efficient ways of conducting business looking at our pipeline today it continues to remain strong further benefiting from the country nfs ascenttm implementation which we believe is the largest deal announced in our space their investment of more than  million plus and the scale in which theyre implementing it demonstrates their confident investment in our solution we now focus on the deliveries and going live in each of these countries which will provide additional confidence to our prospect and further benefit our marketing efforts indeed it is a very exciting time and we are focused on driving improved value for the shareholders with that ill turn the call over to roger to review our financial performance roger roger almond we reported  yearoveryear growth for the quarter with total net revenue of approximately  million compared with  million last year total license services and maintenance revenue were up yearoveryear total license revenue was  million which included contributions from our entire portfolio of solutions of more than  million from the sequentially  second quarter total maintenance fees were stable at  million total services revenue advanced a  million from  million last year for the  second quarter services were slightly down primarily related to when work begin on the country contract we expect services to be strong moving forward as we make progress on the contract as well as others underway as a percentage of total revenue total cost of revenue for the second quarter of  decreased to  from  for the same period last year gross profit rose to  million from  million last year operational expenses were  million for the  third quarter nearly flat yearoveryear we expect our cost in fourth quarter to remain relatively consistent with our third quarter on a gaap basis net income for the third quarter improved to  or  per diluted share as compared with a net loss of  million or  per share in the third quarter of  nongaap adjusted ebitda which primarily removes depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation was  million for the third quarter of  or adjusted eps of  per diluted share as compared with adjusted ebitda of  million or adjusted eps of  per diluted share in the third quarter of  for the first nine months of fiscal  total net revenues advanced to  million with services income comprising  million this compares with total net revenue of  million for the same period one year ago with services revenues comprising  million gaap net income was  million or  per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal  versus a net loss of  million or  per share for the same period last year at march   cash and cash equivalents were approximately  million compared to  million at june   during the quarter we purchased  shares of netsol pk common stock and a total of  million shares for the first nine months of fiscal  for  resulting in an overall decrease in noncontrolling interest to  turning now to our outlook we continue to expect minimum revenue of  million for the fiscal year and on the bottom line we expect to exceed  in adjusted eps for the year as we had additional revenue moving forward we are confident in our ability to build leverage in the business especially as we expect to add more revenue from europe and eventually north america with that i will now turn the call over to naeem naeem naeem ghauri thank you roger we are extremely pleased with our progress and with revenue for the first nine months up more than  compared to the same period last year and we are only just getting started with  country implementation which included china south africa south korea and australia as well as the  million contract ascent business that we signed in europe and which najeeb described earlier and as a result our target market remains extremely strong and our sales pipeline continues to track ahead of expectation our sales and marketing teams throughout the world are extremely busy and we are benefiting from a center sites in europe and asia as well as the country regional implementation providing a strong reference for the rest of the world as you go live in our large programs it adds to those considering our next gen solution including those in north america north america is an important market for us where we have longterm client base to head up our growth initiatives in that region im pleased now to introduce jeff bilbrey over to you jeff jeffrey bilbrey thanks naeem and good morning i joined the board in  and have had the pleasure since then i’ve seen netsol’s positive transformation firsthand including the deployment of the aforementioned next generation solution and additions and expansion of marquee client logos across the globe knowing the companys strategy and market opportunity and its deep connection with customers and the technology behind the products and also having known the people and talent at netsol since my days with innovation group where i launched the highly successful joint venture with netsol i couldnt pass up the opportunity to lead the netsol north america operations i truly believe the market is right for nfs ascent and we have an excellent opportunity to build upon a strong client base in the us and further penetrate the market adding new clients as well so im happy to say that i transitioned from the board to start with netsol on may  and we look forward to updating you on our progress along the way with that ill turn the call back over to najeeb najeeb ghauri thank you jeff standing where we are today with large contract now underway and initiatives throughout the world i and excited and energized about netsol future and confident in our talented team for that remaining time i will now open the call up for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question this morning will come from howard halpern of taglich brothers please go ahead howard halpern congratulations guys great quarter najeeb ghauri thank you howard halpern the first question i guess license revenue was it mostly comprised of legacy or was it more of a combination with ascent product najeeb ghauri roger please you jump in roger almond yes they are combination of both we had some legacy products sold into australia and into china and then we also had our ascent product with those in europe and with the asia pacific area so a combination of both of those howard halpern and going forward with the implementation of the  million contract the european contract you believe that you could drive gross margin to that  mark in the next couple of quarters najeeb ghauri we did  in q we distributed today and we are from almost  for the nine months also which is a pretty healthy trend you can see our control in our hiring and if there is profit sales i believe it is a reasonable goal and we are also aiming that in  range in the coming quarters howard halpern okay and can you describe i guess you know how the implementation in the  million contract is going in i guess in terms of the country rotation i guess that your planning on executing najeeb ghauri yes naeem please answer naeem ghauri yes howard we have got four countries currently under implementation which is china south africa australia and south korea this is quite a heavy if you like workload and our resources are extremely busy each of these four countries are kind of major in their own right in terms of size and volume of business so we are busy with that so what will happen is each of  one of these countries go life we backfill it with another market so that we had any given time we are able to do for in parallel so you know see the fifth country sixth coming as soon as the first and the second go live howard halpern okay i guess this question might be for jeff north america what do you see is the real opportunity and how do you go about starting to build a pipeline of business jeffrey bilbrey hey howard im happy to say that im really optimistic about the opportunity in north america however im still an independent on the board and havent started yet so its a little bit difficult for me to answer that one with specificity i think i had probably referred to najeeb on that howard halpern okay najeeb ghauri yes i think you know jeff  howard jeff will be fully up to speed and the earn call will be ready up and running a lot of senate for the north america business howard halpern okay so one last one little while ago you announced collaboration with ego could you  i guess just provide some insight and you are thinking behind that collaboration najeeb ghauri very exciting opportunity but let naeem answer he is about who is done the deal naeem ghauri yes ego if you take on the website they provide d mapping into your and next year mapping and they worry have few huge appliance so essentially what we are trying to do is define and we have upon synergies on some of things we are doing with our clients as well as something which you’re going to look at in terms of diversification so there is some complementary areas on what we are planning to build for our clients as well as things that which are probably new for us but there is one common denominator which is essentially our resource pull the talent that we have in lahore is second to none and so this is being leveraged and we have been able to leverage those resources to get a stake direct stake in ego and so essentially when these products are market ready will be able to offer some of these or existing clients as well as going out to the mainstream market and d mapping is kind of new space and very few players in that specially the interior mapping it’s quite hard of the moment so we really excited on where this is going so far howard halpern okay guys keep up the great work najeeb ghauri thanks howard naeem ghauri thank you operator our next question will come from mike vermut of newland capital please go ahead mike vermut hi guys great quarter there najeeb ghauri thank you roger almond thank you mike vermut question for here so as we look i don’t want to jump again but looking out of the next few years as the contract still this we built here in the us and then europe and i remember the few call ago you said that our expense structure is pretty much intact until we get to that  million  million or  million range when you did a great job on the expense side is that the way we should be looking at here that’s for the leverage comes from that you are pretty set on the sga side and the leverage should really start to kick in as we move from the  to s to s and you don’t really need to add much more infrastructure up until that ish million level najeeb ghauri in addition to what you said companies already think making sure that we are much more efficient much more productive and get the best quality from our indiscernible developers programmers and in one way you are right we’re not looking for any major developers or programmers hiring because we have enough scale and capability but at the same time were making more strategic investment for example now jeff is joining the company as a indiscernible executive help us work on the us market which is exactly our biggest market that we’ve yet to explore when it comes to our nfs ascent so i believe we are pretty comfortable with our cost structure and all of us naeem myself and roger making sure that if anything  hiring anymore and we don’t do some attrition where we get we maintain the best quality of resources at some point we also like to indiscernible but our focus is on building strong revenue growth and as naeem said we are very busy on this implementation of so many deals and the pipeline is strong so we are very busy in delivering those project and same time we are working with the new project at the same time so i think we will continue to improve our margins you are seeing improvements last two quarters and i think we are quite committed to keep the cost in control naeem do you want to add some more naeem ghauri yes look the numbers are telling the story because apart from some minor incremental cost because obviously the more projects you do you have to put more project managers and so on  on a project but i think from an infrastructure point of view we were all set we have a good ramp up scale available with the facility in the lahore without having to build anything big out so i think the only incremental cost i see potentially when we hit the  million  million over the next few years is essentially just maybe just those additional project managers and you know people at the very very top in terms of development resource in terms of very backend resource we have very good scale already mike vermut right is there any way to give us insight into that pipeline in the us uk and europe and how many of those discussions are with your current customers you know that are now looking to migrate to ascent in the us or in europe i think that makes it an easier sale for the company naeem ghauri i can tell you things are extremely busy in asia australia pacific these three parts are extremely busy we are stretched in terms of from sales perspective we are extremely stressed trying to cover everything so thats good news in europe quite a few interesting opportunities just popped up so pipeline is very healthy so europe is slightly behind in terms of how theyre tracking but they’re certainly way ahead of where they were a year ago so you like for example a year ago we were only talking with that one client which we are implementing now but we are in talks with at least one more which is quite mature and hopefully will mature very fast and then then there are others who have just dropped into the pipeline two at least on a kind of medium stage and two or three early stage so which is good news now in the us we’ve got jeff starting later this month and hes going to have a pretty busy you know schedule over the next two or three months because essentially one of the first things we are going to ask him to do is to go visit all our existing clients which have shown interest in upgrading to ascent those discussions have happened in the past but now at the senior level we have now got an nta president i think there is changes the level of engagement and seniority and these discussions start to get a bit more serious so us would be a little bit further behind so this is how were tracking mike vermut so would we expect within the next year to have some real us contacts or is it farther out from there naeem ghauri it’s being your speculation mike if i would say the next  months i would say certainly we  sales cycles are like nine months to maybe  months typically right so i think im very confident that well be in a sales cycle or two for sure in the next fiscal and how they mature and close within the fiscal year is anyones guess because we dont control the sales cycle but i can tell you nine months to  months is a typical sales cycle and we already have a couple of good leads and how they mature and track over the year but certainly we dont  we cannot speculate on that mike vermut and then another statement on that what is the size of these deals in europe in the us and what are the margin profiles of these verses asian contracts najeeb ghauri whats happening mike is that we actually raise the bar now in terms of the product mix that we now have its really just at a different level to what r nfs was so we’re able to charge premium pricing for our resources that the people were selling at x before now we can sell it at x plus  or  so thats a really big spike on the rates so that helps and then secondly were also been asked to provide more and more of saas kind of pricing and saas is great for us because that has recurring revenue and then longerterm contract and this is gone so its not so lumpy anymore so were starting to build some saas interest as well and one of the  type of strong deals that we have in europe are based on that models so pricing definitely is premium compared to our old product set but it will be a nice mix of both license as well as saas which is as you go monthly kind of rental mike vermut and then last question and i’m not asking for a forecast or anything but when you sit back and you look at the next three years because the scope of the contracts you have signed already is it much easier for you to see that  im going to make a   type growth going forward or is it still we need to fill these pockets or do you have that good setting on both the cost side the revenue side and its much easier for you to give a  to look at a three to fiveyear forecast for the company roger almond so i wouldn’t go as far as the guidance or forecast but it’s just under topline part i dont think we should be putting it in the guidance kind of forecast but i think what we would say is that our expectation is from a sales perspective that if we’re not hitting   yearonyear then we should be so really thats what i tell my team that we need to show  to  growth every year now that goes next year or year or two after i can’t go that far… najeeb ghauri we’ll keep over the annual guidance so i think let’s  what we talk in the year and about  so pretty optimistic mike vermut okay well congrats guys this is a fantastic quarter najeeb ghauri thank you mike roger almond thank you operator operator instructions and the next question will come from john serafini a private investor please go ahead unidentified analyst yes good morning gentleman wonderful job on this quarter couple of questions for you if you can i noticed in the press release one of the bullet points talks about revenue  minimum revenue expectations net revenue of  million for this fiscal year that we will conclude on the end of june and anticipated eps of  a share it seems wonderful to me how do we get to that  a share i know this quarter we have the nongaap metric at  per share so how do we get to the  najeeb ghauri we already have  i believe for the nine months unidentified analyst okay najeeb ghauri but  for the q and our eps on a nongaap basis is  unidentified analyst okay so it’s regular… najeeb ghauri yes i think we look pretty healthy though and so there will be a record for us to have a dollar plus eps on ebitda basis unidentified analyst it’s wonderful so it’s standing achievement really but certainly as a shareholder i appreciate that i just was curious to see whether that’s how you are going to say that so… najeeb ghauri we have a very strong indiscernible provider unidentified analyst yes you do it does an excellent job for you so we appreciate all the work that you do here one other related  well i dont know if its related but i know over time our strategy is to purchase more shares of the pk subsidiary and then now we are controlling now well the noncontrolled shares are about  whats the plan going forward will be we continue to accumulate shares in the subsidiary and eventually can you indicate in anyway what percentage you may end up with say over the next year najeeb ghauri yes i think we did you’ve seen the reports and you will see the q detail of revenue the number should require we did that in this quarter and our strategy is to continue that pattern because ideally in better owned more of it maybe all of it at some point  eps so an eventually i think we will simplify the structure with sometime obviously of new things i going to understand the whole structure but guide our plan and cash requirement cash are utilization and the best of the way so that strategy is ongoing and keep the market posted with the next acquisitions of shares unidentified analyst okay so were going to stay on the path basically najeeb ghauri it seem like unidentified analyst good good okay well those are my questions i appreciate again the good work and your forthright answers and were all cheering you on  on the sidelines here and satisfy how well youre doing so far so keep up the good work and thank you roger almond thanks najeeb ghauri thanks we have a great team here thank you operator and our next question will be a follow up from mike vermut of newland capital please go head mike vermut i guys one follow up one i know a lot of the cash is
