mario anzuonireuters the last year has been rocky for viacom there was the caustic fight for control of the company the ousting of an embattled chief executive and a push to reunite the company with cbs then the abandonment of that plan all the while the company’s tv and film business struggled mightilyon thursday robert m bakish viacom’s new chief executive outlined a path forward for the entertainment conglomerate as the company released business results that showed a glimmer of hope for a turnaroundmr bakish’s fivepoint plan for viacom starts with “putting the full power of viacom” behind six of the company’s flagship brands bet comedy central mtv nickelodeon nick jr and paramount he said those brands resonated with target audiences or genres “big enough to matter” and have strong global presences the brands also have the capacity to produce content across multiple outlets including tv digital and theatersthe company also is seeking to recast its approach to content and talent development strengthen its partnerships with tv distributors and advertisers invest in shortform video content and live events and recharge the culture of the company where morale has been

last two months establishing a turnaround plan for the company which he presented to board members this weekas part of the turnaround mr bakish announced that the company would rebrand its spike tv network in  as a general entertainment paramount network featuring highquality programming movies and documentaries it is a direction that spike tv has been moving in over the last couple of years long marketed as the first television network for men it was known for airing programs like mixed martial arts fights and the reality ridealong show “cops” but recently the network has tried to appeal to a broader audience including women with a programming mix featuring shows like the hit “lip sync battle”“adopting the paramount name and fortifying its programming is a natural way for spike to strengthen its position as a major general entertainment network” mr bakish said “internationally we’ve been very successful in capitalizing on the marquee paramount brand” photo cyma zarghami

risks“we see the new plan as a blueprint for success but now the company must execute in a highly competitive market for viewing and advertising dollars” said benjamin swinburne an analyst with morgan stanleykannan venkateshwar an analyst with barclays said one challenge viacom would face is that cable and satellite companies would view the company’s tv networks in two tiers“in an environment where

betterthanexpected business results that signaled a sense of stability returning to the company total revenues increased  percent to  billion in the fiscal quarter ended in december fueled by

international media networks about viacoms future plans nickalive welcome to nickalive a website and blog about nickelodeon uk bringing you the latest nickelodeon news for nickelodeon channels around the world tuesday march   mint interviews robert m bakish the president and chief executive officer of viacom international media networks about viacoms future plans the indian business newspaper mint has unveiled a exclusive interview that reporter vidhi choudhary recently held with robert m bakish the president and chief executive of viacom international media networks vimn who is responsible for all viacom media networks and associated businesses outside the us including those operating under the multimedia entertainment brands such as nickelodeon comedy central bet paramount channel viva tmf the music factory and game one in south korea the uk australia italy and india where it operates a joint venture with the network group on the papers official website livemintcom in which robert m bakish talks about the entertainment giants future plansetv is a good strategic opportunity for the business robert m bakish robert m bakish president and chief executive of viacom international talks about firm’s future plans robert m bakish is responsible for all viacom media networks and associated businesses outside the us mumbai robert m bakish president and chief executive of viacom international media networks vimn since january  is responsible for all viacom media networks and associated businesses outside the us including those operating under the multimedia entertainment brands such as nickelodeon comedy central bet paramount channel viva tmf the music factory and game one bakish oversees the company’s businesses in south korea the uk australia italy and india where it operates a joint venture with the network group in mumbai to attend the ficci frames conference on the media and entertainment industry he spoke in an interview about the company’s plans to launch new channels in the country and the impact of digitization on the indian television entertainment sector edited excerpts could you elaborate on plans for more channels in india as i said we do plan to have additional services in the national space we see the indian opportunity as a very compelling one as we look to capture the growth we absolutely look at driving this by launching new products that would include new national television products i’d very much like it to happen in  we started by taking our existing assets with nick and vh we then launched colors last year we launched comedy central sonic which is a nickelodeon derivative and nick junior they have helped us in the distribution market with digitization and beginning to help us in the ad market as well how much is viacom paying to acquire the remaining  stake in etv’s entertainment channels are they worth the price as part of a clarification network  bought half the entertainment channels of etv and all the news channels and viacom’s currently looking at doing due diligence on acquiring the other  of the etv assets with the idea of combining network ’s half and half inside of viacom i’m not going to get into valuations we think it’s a good strategic opportunity for the business and regional markets have very strong growth potential if you look at all the projections for india you’ll see that regional markets have higher growth projected than the national markets we think being a combined national and regional player is very adequate to our position in the indian market and we think there are opportunities to create value across those businesses so there are a number of reasons why we are intrigued by this possibility viacom has an option to increase its stake in the joint venture with network for colors would you do that we at viacom are very happy with our viacom joint venture very happy with network  as a partner the joint venture has had significant success in this market partially as a result of good management we think the model works as it is so we are fine with our current position any concerns about the business in india sure very few things are ever perfect if you look at our indian business we would like the ad market to be better by the way i can say that about a lot of countries in the world certainly all the southern european countries—those are in much worse shape but the indian ad market is operating in a place with gdp growth in the  range this is coming from a place where gdp was  growth and the ad market was growing at  that’s not where we are today we are hopeful that that equation will begin to improve as we look at the government’s forecast for next year the  gdp range we believe we’ll see ad market growth the second challenge is ensuring the second phase of digitization goes well phase one was and is a big deal and represented profound change in the business now it’s time for us as an industry to ensure phase two fulfills that promise any dramatic shifts that you may have noticed in the television entertainment sector certainly the most dramatic thing that’s happened in recent history is the whole digitization movement i think it is a positive shock to the industry you don’t usually see a whole category of business shift like that on a short time frame i would put that one in the dramatic category paying for channel slots versus getting paid for fees—that equation has changed dramatically in our favour we look forward to the second phase of digitization with consumption of entertainment going multiscreen what are viacom’s plans to tap into this new segment we used to have a product that could only be consumed on the living room couch and if you’re in india there is probably only one television in the house and so whoever was in control of that remote control probably the woman of the household would be dictating what could be watched today all around the world people have multiple television sets connected to betterthanever pay television plans with more channel capacity and of course they might have a wireless connection and a tablet they could use to consume content probably a smartphone to get content on that we have greater linear television consumption than any other point in history and then we have all these other vehicles so at viacom and viacom  we are focused on creating great content that either spans all these devices maybe in an ott form or we license the same product probably in a different window how do you plan to maximize revenue from the content viacom owns well because there are so many opportunities to display content its vitally important that you own the rights if you look at companies that are fundamentally built on acquiring content versus creating content you much prefer to be in a creating content look at netflix as an example though it is not in india but in the us and uk viacom is becoming a very big supplier for netflix that has produced significant revenue our strategy is to own rights and then look for opportunities to expand the content through distribution fees with pay tv operators it is about participating in the related ad markets whether its a linear television ad market a broadband video ad market or even a mobile market for example not in india but in five european countries we have an mtv mobile service where consumers can get a handset minutes and data in that we also have some ad inventory so if content is at the centre we are looking to use these evolving media platforms as a way of fortifying existing revenue streams and generating new onesalso from advanced televisionviacom planning new indian channels robert bakish viacom’s international media networks presidentceo speaking at the ficci frames media event in mumbai india said that india’s adoption of digital tv and an improved and trustworthy ratings system could lead to viacom launching new channels viacom is a  jointventure partner with tv in viacom  and the partnership is looking at launching more channels and developing more regional offerings which are seeing “fast growth” said bakish tv already owns  ‘general entertainment channels’ and it has been reported locally that viacom is conducting due diligence on the possibility of expanding its jointventure into these channels “the success of a jv is all about having a cultural fit our venture has had challenges and we have been forced to evolve we decided to get into film production we launched more channels like sonic then we created indiacast to take advantage of digitisation we see an opportunity to export content from india we created a channel in the uk rishtey using content from colors and mtv” the indiacast system has seen the jv’s ‘colors’ channels exported to  countries in what viacom described as “reverse migration” “indiacast has a global multiplatform mandate” bakish said “star and zee surprised people by coming together we responded by creating one entity and partnered with disney utv to unlock the value of digitisation while nickelodeon and disney compete fiercely with each other globally the fact is that you have to look at each country differently”also from bestmediainfocomficci frames  breaking the barrier between local and global content is still king and viacom ’s push into the nonenglish space with foreign content has helped break down barriers in the session at ficci frames  on day  on “breaking the barrier between the local and global” the focus shifted to regional play with sai kumar president and ceo network  and board member viacom  and robert bakish president and ceo viacom  international media networks and board member viacom  holding forth sai kumar said “success is a very strange thing tv and vaicom both believe that india is a dynamic market we have pride to say that we saw a dynamic market and a big opportunity into multigeography and platform distribution viacom started its broadcast venture with four channels until they realised that they need to enter the regional space as well” he added “the company had great success with colors and the venture has flourished and evolved with changing markets including mtv nickelodeon and others they also entered into film production and multi channel networks” robert bakish said “we also brought in content from the uk and the us and our main ip has been content creation in the indian media market content travelling from other countries such as fear factor seems to be evolving there have tremendous changes in content for the past  years” sai kumar said “it takes me back when i once said ‘content is king’ already monetisation of television content is at its best today again i stand by the same thought that ‘content is king’” additionally distribution is also improving due to the tough advertising market “advertising has been the softest for the longest time and the pressure from digital has amplified” sai addedalso from exchangemediaits not all about biz but about culture robert bakish local and global content creation and distribution has been of high significance since the longest time the joint venture between viacom and tv has been an interesting journey which has observed a number of milestones thereby breaking the barrier between local and global according to robert bakish president  ceo viacom international media networks  board member viacom it is not all about business but about culture he points out that it is not enough to have a shared vision a correct management fit and a lot of hard work is required the venture has flourished and today includes a bunch of national services such as mtv colors comedy central nickelodeon nick junior and film units among others a major step has been the creation of india cast “we can safely say that it has been a great journey even if not a long one since five years is not a long period of time given the tremendous opportunities not only will we introduce new content but we will export content as well in the near future” bakish shared sai kumar group ceo network and board member viacom believes that it is critical to be extremely aligned with the challenges he finds the learnings from viacom to be invaluable as the group has seen success in various markets with india cast there might be reverse migration according to kumar it is also important to export linear tv and syndicate programmes though it is not only about syndication but about formats that can be picked up by the rest of the world elaborating further bakish stated “we will continue to evolve in various ways when the two partners came together in india we were influenced by both local and global learnings there were two elements that we kept in mind the first is that we are committed to creating content for india which needs a good team the second is brand positioning for the content we are an interconnected world and want to be entertained and that is leading to productions that are not only travelling to the us and the uk but to other parts of the global market as well this is also when india cast came to the fore since today the important ip is a hit television format hence the possibility of replicating content increases and formats today are a great value of scale” where is the market heading kumar remarked that today content consumption is at an all time high and is available on multiple platforms and devices such as mobiles tablets etc even though monetisation through these varied platforms is not very high commenting on india cast kumar stated “it is the second phase of partnership which though out of adversity has worked for us we are extremely bullish about nonlinear platforms” bakish noted that the world is evolving from the economic and structural stand point and added that there has been a rise in services such as video on demand and ott which have observed tremendous changes “this creates its own set of risks and opportunities but we need to focus on the later part today one can watch programmes on tablets television mobiles etc” he further said he called it an important development on the distribution part where the primary enabler is the wireless network in the house and the tablets “nevertheless we have always tried to create great content since opportunities remain very significant” bakish added the outlook bakish maintained that the viacomtv venture is in great shape and is a great opportunity to unlock the value of digitisation he believes that if one operates in different countries they need to look at them differently since each country has its own set of opportunities even though one might have a global plan kumar stressed that measurement is the need of the hour he added “advertising has been the softest in the longest of time we need to be realistic there is lack of measurement in india for niche channels even though measurement of upscale viewers is difficult we need to make an effort at an industry body level” bakish concluded by saying that india is a significant market and that viacom is looking to invest in great content to ensure that it reflects a balance the company will continue to bring varied choices to viewers in terms of content national launches and also a play in the regional markets robert bakish and sai kumar were expressing their views on day one at ficci frames  being held in mumbai from march  to  also from indiantelevisioncomviacom looking at regional play and more channel launches bob bakish mumbai viacom the equal joint venture company between viacom and tv is looking at launching more channels expanding into regional markets and creating content for new media viacom is conducting a due diligence on the etv general entertainment channels gecs viacom international media networks president ceo and viacom board member robert bakish said today the regional markets are seeing fast growth he added indiantelevisioncom was the first to report that tv had offered viacom the option to buy  per cent stake in five etv gecs and  per cent equity interest in etv telugu if viacom decides to buy stake the etv gecs would move to viacom when asked about what kept the joint venture alive the only surviving one in the me space between a global media giant and a local company bakish said that it is not enough to have a shared vision “the success of a jv is all about having a cultural fit our venture has had challenges and we have been forced to evolve we decided to get into film production we launched more channels like sonic then we created indiacast to take advantage of digitisation we see an opportunity to export content from india we created a channel in the uk rishtey using content from colors and mtv” the aim of viacom partnering with network was to make a local cultural connection “in  we realised that india offered opportunities we could not ignore viacom has resources but we felt the need for a local partner jvs are a tradeoff you don’t have complete control therefore it is important to have productive dialogue in korea we have a jv with sbs which started a year ago” said bakish in india the company realised that brand positioning would be key therefore the decision was taken to make colors edgier and more of a risk taker “the good news for india is that more local production money is coming in out of this will come quality content” he also noted that a hit television format is the most valuable ip “after all a local version of ’fear factor’ played a key role in colors’ launch and success” network group ceo sai kumar said the joint venture had been helped by the alignment between the two companies in terms of the scale of ambition and challenges that would have to be met he noted that indiacast has allowed for reverse migration colors is now in  countries “it is not just about the channel going abroad even shows like ballika vadhu have been being picked up abroad” he said talking about new media sai kumar said while platforms like ott and vod represent a risk and an opportunity viacom prefers to focus on the latter kumar noted that  years ago distribution became king as there was a lack of platforms to showcase content today the good news is that content is once again king the challenge today is that while consumption of content is at its highest it has gone multi device the different platform windows are each a kingdom with these platforms the possibility of milking content for revenue has gone up the long tail will stand a better chance in the future” he averred kumar called indiacast the second phase of the jv partnership “indiacast has a global multiplatform mandate” bakish said “star and zee surprised people by coming together we responded by creating one entity and partnered with disney utv to unlock the value of digitisation while nickelodeon and disney compete fiercely with each other globally the fact is that you have to look at each country differently referring to film business in india kumar noted that it is a great adjunct for viacom’s other businesses “there are opportunities for synergies in our film business with colors and other channels at the same time our exposure to film will be strategically limited having two films that are hits does not mean that the next three will also work with each film you start from ground zero” bakish noted that film production business is not for the faint at heart “we had long conversations about why we were in the film production business we have had hits and misses but that is the nature of the game not everything will work” in terms of the challenges facing the media and entertainment industry bakish spoke about the lack of reliability in measurement globally due to multiple platforms “india is great to do business in but it isn’t perfect could digitisation have happened sooner sure could phase one of das have been a solid four cities sure phase two is now happening and the industry needs to keep up the pressure to see that things work” he noted kumar noted that advertising is now at its softest things will not change unless the measurement system improves more homes for sec a could help the niche genre he added posted at  pm email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels interviews with nickelodeon staff nick india nickelodeon india
