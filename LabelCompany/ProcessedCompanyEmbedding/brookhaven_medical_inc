caution the hemoaccess valve system is in development and is not available for sale worldwide overview brookhaven vascular formerly known as creativasc medical is focusing technology innovations targeting end stage renal disease esrd which affects approximately  americans and represents a  billion healthcare cost burden in the us due to the lack of available kidneys for transplantation approximately  esrd patients are on dialysis because their kidneys are no longer able to work at a level needed to sustain life while esrd patients represent less than  of the medicare population they account for  of medicare spending vascular access has been frequently referred to as the achilles heel of dialysis  brookhaven vascular is interested in fielding a significant technology development in this area   clinical problem brookhaven vascular is developing the latest generation of an innovative technology known as the hemoaccess valve system® hvs the first generation of the hvs concept was implanted in humans in an earlystage clinical trial and became one of the three inaugural technologies in the us food and drug administration’s fda innovation pathway program in  the hvs device is designed to potentially address complications associated with arteriovenous av grafts one of the major methods used to connect renal disease patients to a dialysis machine for blood filtration one study showed that in  patients  of patients with an av graft required invasive surgical intervention to maintain blood flow through their graft in the first  months after it is implanted and the surgical intervention is often repeated graft complications can include thrombosis clotting postdialysis bleeding and pseudoaneurysms in addition vascular access induced steal syndrome “blood steal” often causes the fingers and hand below the graft to lose adequate circulation which can lead to pain in the extremities below the graft  and even amputation where loss of circulation has occurred it is believed that these complications may be associated with the unnatural diversion of blood from an artery to a vein via the av graft for  hours a day when it is only needed for dialysis access  hours a week an av graft places a burden on the heart since it requires high volumes of blood to be pumped through it to maintain its patency flow  a normal brachial artery handles  gallons of blood daily while a graft requires  gallons to maintain the graft equal to over eight times the blood volume  cardiovascular disease is major cause of death among esrd patients brookhaven vascular technology the ideal av graft hemodialysis process would be to selectively “turn on” blood flow into the av graft when the patient needs vascular access for dialysis then “turn off” the flow of blood when the patient is not in dialysis restoring normal blood flow to the artery and vein this is the breakthrough that the hemoaccess valve system® hvs may offer  the hvs device will be implanted when a patient has a dialysis graft implanted for av access when the dialysis technician will magnetically activate the hvs device valves at each end of the av graft will open allowing blood flow for dialysis  when dialysis is concluded the av graft is flushed with saline then the technician will use the device’s actuator to close the valves restoring normal blood flow to the artery and vein  sterile salineheparin solution will remain in the graft between dialysis sessions  the hemoaccess valve system® is only in development and not available for sale anywhere in the world at this time potential clinical benefits no clinical benefits have been proven with the use of the hvs some of the potential benefits are as follows  potential reduction of thrombosis clotting which require frequent interventional surgeries to keep av grafts functioning for dialysis potential reduction of pseudoaneurysms which can lead to significant bleeding events after the patient has left the dialysis clinic potential reduction in the added workload on the heart to pump high rates of blood through the graft as noted previously x the normal blood flow recognition and a platform technology in addition to being selected as an fda innovation pathway technology the hvs device has won multiple awards including one of five winners out of over  entries in the history channel’s invent now innovation awards the winner of the deloitte innovision new technology award the hvs device may provide an innovative way to activate an implanted pump device without internal batteries or motors and without the use of needles to inject saline to activate the graft valves we believe this may have the potential to become a platform technology that has multiple applications for other medical applications  the hvs technology is protected by a broad portfolio of more than  issued and pending patents in the us and around the world caution the hemoaccess valve system is only in development
