interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods therefore certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap have been condensed or omitted in the opinion of management all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented have been made the results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december   the balance sheets and certain comparative information as of december   are derived from the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   “ annual financial statements” included in the company’s  annual report on form k these unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the  annual financial statements   basis of presentation   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid debt investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased the company has no cash equivalents as of march   and december   respectively   going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern  table of contents at march   the company had a stockholders deficit of  and a negative working capital of  which mainly resulted from the accumulated deficit of its former parent company that was transferred to the company upon its spinoff from the parent company and a lack of profitable operating history the company hopes to increase revenues from its real estate business and financial advisory services business in the absence of significant increases in revenues the company intends to fund operations through additional debt and equity financing arrangements the successful outcome of future activities cannot be determined at this time and there are no assurances that if achieved the company will have sufficient funds to execute its intended business plan or generate positive operating results   the companys success is dependent upon numerous items certain of which are the successful growth of revenues from its services and its ability to obtain new customers in order to achieve levels of revenues adequate to support the companys current and future cost structure for which there is no assurance unanticipated problems expenses and delays are frequently encountered in establishing and maintaining profitable operations these include but are not limited to competition the need to develop customer support capabilities and market expertise technical difficulties market acceptance and sales and marketing the failure of the company to meet any of these conditions could have a materially adverse effect on the company and may force the company to reduce or curtail operations no assurance can be given that the company can achieve or maintain profitable operations the company believes it will have adequate cash to sustain operations until it achieves sustained profitability however until the company has a history of maintaining revenue levels sufficient to support its operations and repay its working capital deficit the company may require additional financing sources of financing could include capital infusions additional equity financing or debt offerings there can be no assurance that funding will be available on acceptable terms if at all or that such fund if raised would enable the company to achieve or sustain profitable operations   these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s financial instruments consist of cash prepaid expenses and other receivables accounts payable accrued liabilities and due tofrom affiliated company  the fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments fair value measurements   asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date the three levels are defined as follows   level   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   level   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument   level   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement   the companys financial instruments consisted of cash accounts payable and accrued liabilities advances due to or from affiliated companies and notes payable to officers  the estimated fair value of cash accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to or from affiliated companies and notes payable approximates its carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with the gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates    table of contents revenue recognition   accounting standards codification “asc”  revenue recognition which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with securities and exchange commission management believes the companys revenue recognition policies conform to asc

revenue until the project is completed and the fees are no longer refundable   income taxes   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements net of operating loss carry forwards and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities   earnings per share   a basic earnings per share is

and holiday inn we are one of the most active hotel buyers in the market asap believes we will continue this growth for the next couple of years taking advantage of current below replacement cost assets with reasonable cap rates and valueadd opportunities in the current us hotel market results of operations   revenues since the company’s primary business is based upon potential transactions in real estate the company is subject to variance in revenues due to investors sentiment towards real estate substantially all of our revenues are in the form of consulting fees collected from our clients usually negotiated on a transactionbytransaction basis the company’s consulting fees primarily consist of revenue derived from transaction commission received from acquisition advisory the company earns the consulting fees by sourcing the deal underwriting financials coordinating due diligence on all contracts recommending lenders hiring third party property management companies and negotiating franchise agreements another revenue source for the company includes asset management fees which consist of supervision of daily weekly and monthly operating results of the hotel review of capital expenditure requests communication with lenders negotiating personal and real property tax assessments and most importantly oversight on brand relations the company’s clients include concentration of two to three main clients our concentration of clients does provide a risk for revenue growth the company has established strong relationships with our clients our business and client relationships and our culture and philosophy are firmly centered on putting the clients’ interests first we have been building strong reputation in the hospitality industry which is bringing several new potential clients we expect to have steady revenue stream from our  major clients while building new client base for future revenue growth we believe that our product offerings asset management

other services that facilitate the closing of deals   cost of sales consisting mainly of consulting expense is primarily the result of the commissions and other incentive compensation incurred

of  respectively for providing advisory services in real estate acquisition as compared to  for the same period last year the higher consulting expenses in the first three months of  were mainly due to the closing of one big hotel acquisition deal mentioned above  operating expenses   general and administrative “ga” expenses consist primarily of administrative personnel costs facilities expenses and professional fee expenses   for the three months ended march   ga expenses decreased by  or  to  compared to  for the same period last year the decrease was mainly due to one highly paid manager

last year the changes in interest expense were mainly due to the higher average note payable balances   net income the company recorded a net loss of  for the three months ended march   as compared to a net loss of  for the same period last year the increase in net loss was mainly due to the higher consulting expense the lack of other income and higher interest expense offset by higher revenue and lower ga expenses liquidity and capital resources during the next twelve months asap expo will focus on its real estate transactions to generate additional revenue with the net revenue from its services and continuing support from its major shareholders to provide a note payable management believes asap expo will have enough net working capital to sustain its business for another  months   the forecast of the period of time through which asap expo’s financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forwardlooking statement that involves risks and uncertainties asap expo’s actual funding requirements may differ materially as a result of a number of factors including unknown expenses associated with the cost of providing real estate advisory investment banking and management consulting services the report of the companys independent registered public accounting firm on our december   financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph stating that the company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated stockholders deficit which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty liquidity and capital resources our working capital for the periods presented is summarized as follows

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the our financial statements and the accompanying notes the amounts of assets and liabilities reported on our balance sheet and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for but not limited to the accounting for revenue recognition stock based compensation and the valuation of deferred taxes actual results could differ from these estimates the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements   revenue recognition   accounting standards codification “asc”  revenue recognition outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with securities and exchange commission management believes the companys revenue recognition policies conform to asc       revenues are mainly consulting fees the consulting fees are recognized when earned  consulting fees subject to refund are recorded as deferred revenue until the project is completed and the fees are no longer refundable   table of contents income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes under asc  income taxes under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled management provides a valuation allowance for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be recovered item  controls and procedures our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the securities exchange act of  as amended as of the end of the period covered by this report  based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of  i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure  our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting and as such are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance that the control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met see the section below in this item  entitled limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls    changes in internal controls over financial reporting   there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df of the securities exchange act of  as amended that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls   our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives and our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the internal control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate  table of contents part ii  other information item  legal proceedings
