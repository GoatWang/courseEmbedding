savings affect the buy price the initial saving applied to a fund depends on how it is priced dual priced funds have two different prices a sell price and a buy price single priced funds have a single price at which the fund can be bought and sold for dual priced funds the difference between the buy and sell price is made up of the initial charge and other costs eg the fund managers dealing costs the initial saving from hl will reduce the buying price but even with a full discount the buying price may still be higher than the selling price for single priced funds the price quoted does not include the initial charge any initial charge after deduction of the initial saving from hl will be added to the price quoted please note that even where a full saving is offered a dilution levy could be applied on the way in or out of the fund for full details please see the hl guide to fund prices savings and yields × annual charges performance fee no   ongoing charge ocfter  i ongoing saving
