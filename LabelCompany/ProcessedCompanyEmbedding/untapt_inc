twitter facebook linkedin contact infountaptcom untapt inc  w th street new york ny   untapt inc faq  untapt blog june   sam faq there are lots of job search sites out there why should i become a member of untapt untapt is different here’s why    you explore jobs confidentially – you can browse job opportunities discreetly your personal information is completely confidential until you choose to apply to a specific job – and even then it is shared only with the direct hiring manager    you gain insight through videos – hiring managers post videos that help you decide whether this is a company or person you would like to work for likewise when you apply to a position you have the chance to record a video that will fasttrack your application and allow the hiring manager to make a decision quickly    we focus on fintech – untapt is focused on technical roles within fintech which allows us to more closely match you with relevant positions provide insights and career advice   do you share any of my information your privacy and confidentiality is very important to us  we do not sell distribute your information or otherwise make it available to anyone else  all your details stay within untapt we also don’t want to link to a third party site which could potentially have access to information you do not want to share especially sensitive information such as looking for a new job  untapt provides the capability to login with your linkedin account and retrieve information from linkedin into your profile but only if you choose to   will my managercolleaguecompany know that i am using untapt to look for another job not if you don’t tell them  in fact hiring managers do not see any details about you unless you apply for their job  until then all that hiring managers see is a rough number of candidates that match their job description this puts you in control safe in the knowledge that your personal information is not being distributed behind the scenes   if you have my email address will i get lots of spam no  the purpose of providing us with your email address is so that we can keep you abreast of new jobs or information  you can choose whether you want to be notified regularly or if you simply want us to check in with you at some point in the future   i created a profile and there are no matches  did i just waste my time not at all  new jobs are being added all the time  we will email you when jobs are added that meet your skills  in addition as we expand our site we will provide more color with respect to jobs that perhaps were a close fit so that if appropriate you can update your profile accordingly  lastly untapt goes beyond simply finding you a job  we want to help enhance your career by providing you with insights in the job market and fintech in general  we hope that your membership is just the beginning of a long relationship with untapt   is fintech just another term for jobs in banks there is a wide array of financial institutions  banks are just one type  other more traditional companies could be reinsurers asset managers and consulting firms that focus on financial institutions  nontraditional financial institutions include startups that are changing the way we invest execute cpu intensive calculations or perform datarich complex analysis to name just a few  across these institutions there are all kinds of jobs from front end developers to devops to business analysts to hard core programmers qa testers to infrastructure engineers   should i put word and powerpoint as skills we would not recommend it  untapt focuses on the best technical talent – whether you program in an oo or functional programming language are a business analyst know sql understand infrastructure such as networks and virtualization test software or have the ability to provide helpdesk support untapt will have something for you  but if your technical skills do not fall into any of these categories then untapt is probably not for you  if you are interested in any of these as a career path there are lots of training methods available  just a few examples include general assembly codeorg the  flat iron school and codecademy   i signed up but now i want to remove my profile  what do i do simply email supportuntaptcom and request we remove your account  we will then completely erase your profile  job matches and any open applications   i have questions about my career  how can untapt help me feel free to email us at supportuntaptcom for advice and information sam navigation for hiring managers
