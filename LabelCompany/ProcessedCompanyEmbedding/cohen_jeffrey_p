tendonitisdescriptionthe achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the human body it is located at the back of the ankle joint and can be felt as a large cordlike structure attaching to the back of the foot since tendons serve to attach muscles to bone the achilles tendon also attaches the large calf muscles the gastrocnemius and soleus to the back of the heel bone the calcaneusthe muscle mass and strength of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are greater than all of the other muscles of the lower leg combined therefore the pull of these muscles on the achilles tendon is very large since these muscles help balance the body while standing push the body forward during walking spring the body forward during running and spring the body upward during jumping because of the large amount of stress which the achilles tendon is subjected to during running and jumping activities the achilles tendon is prone to injurythe most common form of injury to the achilles tendon is called achilles tendonitis which is an inflammatory condition causing pain in the achilles tendon achilles tendonitis generally occurs in people who are active in sports activities types of sports that commonly are associated with achilles tendonitis are basketball tennis running football soccer volleyball and other running and jumping sportsachilles tendonitis tends to occur more frequently in older athletes than in younger athletes as a person ages into their thirties and especially into their forties and fifties the ligaments and tendons of the body tend to lose some of their stretchiness and are not as strong as before this predisposes older individuals who are active in running and jumping activities to tendon injuries such as achilles tendonitis however achilles tendonitis can also occur in teenagers who are very active in running and jumping sportsdiagnosisachilles tendonitis is diagnosed by a history and physical examination of the patient who describes pain at the back of the ankle with walking andor running activities the pain generally will be associated with an increase in running or jumping intensity or frequency it is also often associated with a change from running in a thick heeled shoe to a thin heeled shoe such as going from training shoes to racing flats andor racing spikes in crosscountry andor track the pain from achilles tendonitis is often so severe that running is impossible and even walking is uncomfortableduring the physical examination the podiatrist will feel and push lightly around the achilles tendon to see if it is tender or has any irregularities in its surface achilles tendonitis may cause the tendon to be thickened in areas may cause swelling of the area around the tendon and can even feel like the tendon has a painful bump on it in addition the person with achilles tendonitis will limp while barefoot but walk more normally with heeled shoes on xrays are not helpful in diagnosing achilles tendonitis but may be taken to ruleout other pathology mri scans are only indicated if a partial or complete rupture of the achilles tendon is suspected by the podiatristtreatmentachilles tendonitis generally responds very well to conservative treatment as long as it is diagnosed and treated early surgery is rarely indicated unless the achilles tendonitis is particularly severe and chronic or if the tendon has ruptured completelyinitially the podiatrist may treat the achilles tendonitis by putting heel lifts into the patients shoes in addition the patient may be asked to avoid barefoot walking or walking in lowheeled shoes nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids such as ibuprofen motrin advil and naproxen naprosyn aleve may also be prescribed to calm the inflammatory process in the tendon icing may be suggested to help decrease the inflammation and pain in the tendon stretching exercises for the calf muscles may also be given to the patient to help loosen the calf muscle and achilles tendon so that the tendon is not under as much stress during normal daily walking activities the stretching should not be done however if it causes pain in the achilles tendoninitially the patient with achilles tendonitis will be asked to modify their activities to decrease their running and jumping activities and do alternative physical activities such as swimming which dont put as much stress on the achilles tendon as the tendon starts to feel better the podiatrist will allow a gradual return to normal running and jumping activities if normal return to activities is not possible within a few weeks then many times the podiatrist may additionally prescribe physical therapy andor functional foot orthotics to help the tendon heal more rapidly the foot orthotics generally are used during both the sports activities and walking activities to allow for more normal foot and achilles tendon function if the physician is concerned about a partial tear of the tendon the patient may be placed in a below the knee cast it can take several weeks or even months for the tendon to heal depending upon the severity of the injury to the tendon it is not uncommon for a patient to return to activities too quickly and reinjure the tendon careful monitoring of a return to full activity is important and the patient must have patience during this period of timedisclaimerit is important for you to

precision podiatry plantar fasciitisdescriptionplantar fasciitis is an inflammation of a thick fibrous ligament in the arch of the foot called the plantar fascia the plantar fascia attaches into the heel bone and fans out toward the ball of the foot attaching into the base of the toes if this ligament is stretched excessively it will become inflamed and begin to cause pain in severe instances the ligament can rupture resulting in immediate severe pain if the ligament ruptures the pain is so great that the patient can not place weight on the foot should this happen the foot should be elevated and an ice pack applied an appointment with your foot doctor should be made at your earliest convenience sports such as tennis racket ball and aerobics can cause extreme tension on the plantar fascia resulting in small tears or rupture of the ligament however other less stressful activities can result in tears or rupture of the plantar fascia under the right set of circumstances one consequence of small tears in the plantar fascia is the formation of firm nodules within the plantar fascia called fibromasdiagnosistaking a through history of the course of the condition and physical exam makes the diagnosis of plantar fasciitistreatmenttreatment of plantar fasciitis is similar to that for heel pain cortisone injections used in the treatment of heel pain are not commonly used for the treatment of plantar fasciitis the main emphasis of treatment is to reduce the forces that are causing the plantar fascia to stretch excessively this includes calf muscle stretching overthecounter arch supports and oral antiinflammatory medicine may be useful in controlling the paindisclaimerit is important for you to understand that the information provided is of a basic educational nature only and does not

all medical information presented should be discussed with your health care professional haglunds deformity — precision podiatry haglands deformitydescriptionthe common cause of a painful bump on the back of the heel is called haglands deformity this is due to an enlarged bony prominence on the back of the heel it can involve the entire back of the heel or just a portion of the back of the heel usually on the outside portion of the heel also called the pump bump it is most common in women and is frequently a result of pressure from the back of the shoe as the shoe rubs on the back of the heel bone it begins to swell and enlarge quite often a bursa will form a bursa is sack that is created over any bony promance when excessive pressure or friction to the areas occurs bursa can be filled with a thick watery like fluidtreatment of haglands deformity and pump bumpstreatment consists of removing the pressure and avoiding shoes which rub on the back of the heel orthotics custom molded shoe inserts can be useful because they reduce the rocking motion sidetoside of the heel while walking which aggravates the painful area cortisone injections can temporarily reduce the pain or eliminate the pain surgery can be the treatment of choice if other means to reduce the pressure are unsuccessfulspurring in the achilles tendonclosely related to haglands deformity is an enlargement that can occur on the back of the heel that is a result of the formation of a large spur where the achilles tendon attaches treatment is the same as with the haglands deformity except that the surgical procedure to remove the spurring is more complex and has a longer recovery periodachilles tendonitisswelling and lumps can also occur in the achilles tendon just above its attachment into the heel bone termed achilles tendonitis this occurs when there is a tear in the tendon if this goes untreated the tendon is at risk of rupturing treatment consists of immobilization with a cast possibly crutches to take weight off the foot oral antiinflammatory drugs and if severe of surgery once the area is healed aggressive physical therapy and calf muscle stretching exercises there is another small tendon that attaches in the back of the heel that can become injured it is called the plantaris tendon this tendon can tear or rupture during exercise it is associated with a sudden onset of pain during exercise and mimics achilles tendonitisan uncommon cause  xanthomasan uncommon cause of small lumps in the achilles tendon called xanthomas is due to an excessively high cholesterol level in the blood stream this is a hereditary disorder that results in the deposition of cholesterol in the achilles tendon this is a serious condition and requires aggressive treatment by a physician to lower the cholesterol levels left untreated the high cholesterol levels can lead to premature heart attach and deathdisclaimerit is important for you to understand that the information provided is of
