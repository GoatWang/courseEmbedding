acquisitions ed fiorentino    actient pharmaceuticals actient pharmaceuticals was a management partnership formed with ed fiorentino a former senior executive at abbott laboratories to acquire specialty pharmaceutical companies and products as part of gtcr’s leaders strategy™ in less than three years actient completed five proprietary acquisitions and built a unique diversified portfolio of commercial products and pipeline assets focused on the treatment of urological indications actient was formed in  based on gtcr’s thesis that the pharmaceutical industry was an attractive area for investment given several positive trends including an aging population increasing availability of drugs for new indications and increasing prescription drug coverage in addition nearterm growth challenges among mid and largecap pharmaceutical companies resulted in significant industry consolidation leading to product divestitures as these companies attempted to reprioritize their portfolios and shed noncore assets based on mr fiorentino’s industry experience at abbott we believed actient was well positioned to evaluate these attractive divestiture opportunities and ultimately build a leading specialty business through acquisitions of marketed products and companies the actient strategy focused on acquiring undermanaged products thereby creating an opportunity to grow and preserve these assets through targeted promotion strategies and life cycle management programs in july  actient closed its first proprietary transaction a corporate carveout of six onmarket products from ucb pharma the transaction provided actient with a strategic asset in the urology space and an opportunity to establish a commercial platform with stable cash flows that could be leveraged through additional acquisitions in january  actient acquired timm medical technologies a leader in urology medical devices the acquisition of timm enabled actient to expand its urology presence by offering

consistent with actient’s focus in urology in december  actient completed the transformative acquisition of slate pharmaceuticals adding the product testopel testosterone pellets for implantation one of the fastestgrowing products in one of the fastestgrowing segments of the pharmaceutical industry the acquisition complemented actient’s strategic focus broadening the portfolio of leading products marketed to urologists six months later in june  actient acquired bartor pharmacal the bartor acquisition helped to secure the manufacturing of testopel and reduce cost of goods sold in less than three years through five proprietary acquisitions and organic growth we believe actient became one of the fastestgrowing pharmaceutical companies the management team faced a number of challenges in building the company ranging from sourcing and completing acquisitions to manufacturing and growing sales of its products the team proved to be highly effective in building the business hiring key

expertise in the healthcare industry gtcr began to dedicate significant time and resources towards evaluating investment opportunities in the life sciences sector much like the pharmaceutical sector gtcr identified life sciences as an attractive area for investment given its significant market size compelling industry dynamics and strong growth outlook the firm’s proactive effort eventually led to a relationship with geoff crouse a life sciences industry veteran with prior experience at roche millipore and immucor gtcr began formally working with mr crouse in  evaluating numerous potential investment opportunities before identifying stem cell cryopreservation and storage as an attractive niche subsegment within life sciences as a result in october of  we began to engage in discussions

experimental treatments for regenerative medicine applications such as brain injury cerebral palsy and hearing loss cbr is dedicated to supporting the clinical application of cord blood and cord tissue stem cells by partnering with institutions to establish fdaregulated clinical trials for conditions that had no known cure cbr’s attractive commercial model – comprised of an upfront processing fee and longterm annual storage fees – provides strong revenue visibility and recurring cash flow with minimal customer attrition the investment thesis in cbr was based on gtcr’s belief that the company was well positioned to drive continued profitable growth of the installed base and benefit from the compounding of longterm storage revenue during gtcr’s ownership the firm worked with mr

seeing advantage in medicare advantage herbert fritch    healthspring in  congress enacted the medicare modernization act “mma” the first significant piece of healthcare legislation since the balanced budget amendment of  “bba” looking to leverage gtcr’s deep experience in managed healthcare services we targeted healthcare industry niches that would benefit from the mma legislation and identified privately sponsored medicare advantage “ma” plans as one such area while the bba had significantly cut reimbursement to these plans in  the mma restored reimbursement in a number of ways that encouraged private plans to provide attractive options to seniors at that time officials at cms the federal healthcare regulatory agency were supporting the continued privatization of medicare and we believed wellmanaged healthcare companies in the ma industry would enjoy strong growth and profitability over the ensuing years during  gtcr searched for an industry leader with whom to capitalize on this attractive growth opportunity our work led us to herbert fritch the founder and ceo of healthspring formerly newquest a private rapidly growing ma and commercial health plan company gtcr believed that mr fritch was one of the most talented and knowledgeable executives in the ma industry and that healthspring was a strong industry platform managing higherquality patient care at lower costs in addition to mr fritch’s strong leadership and the quality of his team we found the healthspring platform to be attractive for several other reasons first healthspring’s presence in four states provided both a diversified membership base and the opportunity to expand into adjacent markets second healthspring’s strong focus on healthcare physician partnerships aligned economic incentives and helped drive highquality patient care finally healthspring’s evidencebased diseasemanagement programs enabled the company to provide better healthcare on a more costeffective basis in march  gtcr partnered with mr fritch to recapitalize healthspring acquiring a majority stake in the company we worked closely with mr fritch to transform the business operationally adding key senior managers to

offered an opportunity to establish an attractive recurring revenue business through the acquisition of products with fda market exclusivity intellectual property protection and other attractive attributes at this time ma activity in the pharmaceutical industry was robust after a wave of large pharmaceutical mergers in the s many large diversified pharmaceutical companies were rationalizing their drug portfolios selling small noncore drugs servicing niche markets this trend increased acquisition and inlicensing opportunities for smaller specialty pharmaceutical companies at the same time many midsized and large pharmaceutical companies had significant cash balances and were willing to pay full value for midsized specialty pharmaceutical businesses of particular interest were those businesses well positioned in key therapeutic focus areas possessing both attractive onmarket and developmentstage drugs to drive future growth gtcr knew that building deep domain expertise and

neurology drugs sabril and frisium in  the subsequent development and fda approval of sabril in  was a substantial value driver for ovation in its eventual sale ovation made several additional neurology acquisitions further transforming the company most importantly ovation acquired the us commercial rights to xenazine the first drug approved in the us for the treatment of chorea a

continuing to improve operating performance in  lifepoint hospitals another publicly traded acutecare hospital company acquired province healthcare following the sale our private equity firm explored the possibility of reentering the industry the opportunity to drive revenue growth and increase profitability at undermanaged hospitals continued to exist and we committed to a second effort in the
