newssummarygoldman sachs bdcs stock price has performed very well since the bdc went public two years ago but no new equity has been raised at the premium availablewe examine if gsbds slow growth may lie in goldman capitals ambitions to have multiple funds under its management in the middle market at the expense of its public bdcthe bdc reporter lists out the many conflicts between gsbds external manager and its shareholders that may result in lower than optimal returns over time or even a catastrophe background goldman sachs bdc nysegsbd is the most recent public business development company in the market going public just two years ago at a price of  from a stock price standpoint gsbd has been a remarkable success both in the current bull market and in the prior period when bdc values suffered as the chart below  extracted from the latest k shows  gsbd has traded at or above its net asset value per share most of the time since going public and never dropping at quarters end more than  behind book value in recent quarters with the bdc leveraged at or close to its self imposed asset coverage limits the price premium to nav has reached record levels as the stock chart above illustrates even if actual financial performance has flattened out and risk has increased the subject of our next article a few days ago the stock reached a price of  a whopping  premium to q  net asset value per share dreamer the bdc reporter  and others weve talked to  have been surprised that gsbd unlike other bdcs that trade consistently at a premium to book like main street capital golub capital triangle capital and hercules capital has not taken advantage of investor enthusiasm for the bdc to issue new shares at a very accretive premium and continue to expand its middle market lending footprint in one way gsbds apparent caution or conservatism about growth appears almost laudable perhaps the external manager is reading the bdc reporter and heeding our misgivings about bdcs growing assets in an environment of increasingly thin spreads weak covenants and higher borrower leverage all of which gsbd is affected by as a review of the k will show middle market believer however thats unlikely and as well see below the goldman nysegs parent has not been shy to add middle market loan assets elsewhere in the system nor is it that goldman believes that the bdc has reached its natural limits in fact as gsbd points out at one point in the k the overall market for middle market lending  as defined by goldman  is seen as huge according to the national center for the middle market and the cia world fact book the us middle market is comprised of approximately  companies that collectively generate revenues of more than  trillion annually the us middle market represents nearly  of private sector gross domestic product or equivalent to the worlds third largest global economy on a standalone basis so is it market prudence and concern for longterm shareholder value that has been kept from the famously ambitious goldman organization from growing its public bdc or are there other factors at work of course no one at gsbd is commenting on the subject for all we know when we look up from the keyboard well find that a secondary offering has just been announced however the bdc reporter does have a suspicion  discussed below  why gsam the external manager of gsbd has been a shrinking violet in terms of growth and worries about the future too goldman sachs bdc analysis of conflicts of interest disclosures tiny fish in a huge pond the first thing you need to know about goldman sachs is that its everywhere the worlds most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money  journalist matt taibbi profiling the bank for rolling stone magazine in  despite the famous quote above the gsam organization responsible for middle market lending is a tiny cog in the goldman sachs asset management machine according to the k goldman has  professionals managing  trillion of assets worldwide see page  by contrast gsam which is responsible for gsbd consists of just  individuals the member senior team from whence the investment committee is drawn have been together for  years to compare and contrast internally managed triangle capital nysetcap which manages a similar dollar value portfolio has a person team both organizations self originate the bulk of their loans and lend to companies of roughly similar ebitda levels tcap is moving up the size scale and gsbd down thats a pretty small investment group and probably reflects the fact that goldman is a relatively late entrant to the middle market lending business despite its famous name not much going on certainly the external manager has been able to barely increase portfolio size since going public last year total portfolio assets at cost increased just  million take out the increased investment in the jv which buys lower risklower return and more liquid loans for much larger sized companies than the onbalance sheet portfolio loan assets increased less than  million since december  when gsbd was still private its non jv assets have increased only  weve been busyelsewhere one possible reason why  which is mentioned in the k in the section where shareholders are warned about the risks they face and which  ironically  is the least read portion of the annual filing because of its long iteration of undifferentiated risk some a clear and present danger and some as frequent as a black swan  is that gsam is otherwise engaged as the extract from the k shows gsam is managing two other business development companies goldman sachs private middle market credit llc gs pmmc and goldman sachs middle market lending corp gs mmlc these are nontraded bdcs a highly profitable for the investment advisors and investment bankers associated subsegment of the bdc market which only gets fitful attention from the financial press which is fixated on companies which have a ticker symbol spelled out the shareholders of gsbd therefore have to vie for attention with two other bdc funds with identical objectives in a leveraged loan market already flooded with competitors and a paucity of good deals if the complaints of most every bdc on most every conference call are to be believed of course gsbds shareholders pay the same management fee even if their external manager is otherwise engaged much of the time furthermore gsams multitasking also creates a host of conflict of interest issues which the k both describes and seeks to diminish the risk of in the k there are  different risks called out relating to gsbds business and structure we counted  different times these carefully constructed filings which are typically penned and reviewed by crack corporate attorneys mentioned conflicts of interest that might affect gsbds shareholders we thought it the bdc reporters duty to bring some of those jeremiads to our readers attention got a better deal over there the economics of the different funds may cause deals to be pushed away from gsbd as this extract explains sorry they got here first or there will not be enough loan assets generated for everyone in the goldman family as this next extract says or goldman could already be a lender or investor in a prospective borrower which would cause obvious conflicts with gsbd or just may keep the investment advisor from even considering booking the investment in the public bdc further down the k page  this warning is offered up remember the financial crisis goldman does at some point in the future the very fact that gsbd has goldman in its name could affect the bdcs investments strategy and approach or even the continuance of gsam as its external manager goldman reserves the right to satisfy the demands made by its regulators even if at the expense of gsbd and its shareholders read the third paragraph for a preview of a worst case scenario in a like situation there are other conflicts besides these but we dont want to make this article any longer than it already is but we recommend any shareholder existing or prospective to read all the risk disclosures to get the full picture goldman says of course both in the k and on its conference call the investment advisor promised to mitigate the risks of gsams multiple fund ownership by setting up fair procedures for allocating loans in fact management is making the argument that the exemptive relief received in january  that will allow different goldman managed bdc funds including gsbd to coinvest together will be a plus for all concerned moreover management promises that having three funds to allocate loans to will not cause the external manager to deviate from its current target sized borrower or transaction type but will make goldman more competitive when seeking to be chosen as the lender on transactions another extract from the k every reader can draw their own conclusions but the bdc reporter noted that the process used to appropriately allocate transactions could sometimes result in gsbd losing out on some good loan investments if they happened not to be the next recipient in gsams rotation bdc reporters view now later and one day as weve said some risks may result in shortterm impact some may not play out for years and some none at all in this case we believe all  versions apply its quite possible that gsbds failure to take advantage of its hot stock price and opportunity to raise new capital very accretively which could be a boon for existing shareholders is already the result of some of the conflicts of interest highlighted above goldman might be spending more time and effort on its other funds due to better advisor economics or as part of a strategic attempt to build up its nontraded bdc presence many of its investment bankingasset management peers are active in that less publicized segment of the market and goldman does not like to give up a market without a fight thats a matter of opportunity lost which existing shareholders whove benefited from the twoyear stock price surge may not be concerned with further down the road gsbd may fail to garner the optimal transactions in its segment because of the appetites of the other funds and the need to provide all goldmans investors with a fair shake or worse quietly and unprovably the better deals might slip out from gsbds grasp and into the nontraded funds or other credit vehicles gsam might be put in charge of supply and demand you know however shareholders in the future may be happy to get what they can from gsam even if theoretically suboptimal finally the vaunted parentage of gsbd which may or may not account for the great premium the public bdc enjoys though we can also point to a decent management fee a better than average incentive fee a lowerthanmost debt to equity and a stable distribution could become a deadly liability a series of very bad things would have to happen but goldmans decision to be both a bank and an asset manager we are simplifying a very complicated subject could backfire on gsbds shareholders at the worst possible time in the next recession or if there is a regulatory blowout of some kind in the future in a world with many risks for bdcs this is one that applies only at gsbd even if it is unlikely ever to be faced not the right thing to do from the bdc reporters perspective none of these risks and conflicts of interest taken separately or together are reason enough to avoid the stock however we cant help feeling that goldman  in its impetus to maximize its own income and continue the industrywide mad rush to increase assets under management in the credit space  has left gsbds shareholders with only a part time external manager a hand brake activated on value creation and a continuous question mark about what might or might not be happening behind the scenes this is not different from a great number of bdcs part of asset management organizations with multiple tentacles a frequent object of complaint by the bdc reporter but does not make it right of course in this very forgiving environment for bdc stocks what a difference a year makes goldman will be able to walk through the rain and not get wet only time will tell if the bdc underperforms in the years ahead
