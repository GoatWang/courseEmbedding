development agreement lyon france wednesday june    hrs  ist flamel technologies sa and digna biotech sl announced that the two companies have entered into a joint development agreement for the preclinical and clinical development of multiple products the agreement has been structured to leverage dignas ground breaking research preclinical and clinical development efforts and flamels formulation expertise in creating safer more efficacious products using its innovative proprietary drug delivery platforms medusa and micropumpflamel will be primarily responsible for the formulation and manufacturing process development and digna will be primarily responsible for the preclinical and clinical development the three initial digna products that have been identified for development under the agreement are p p and methylthiadenosine mta all of these molecules have shown significant activity in preclinical studies involving multiple indications with high unmet medical need both companies expect that the achievement of clinical proof of concept data under the joint development agreement will result in significant additional value creation for the partiesp disitertide is a transforming growth factor beta tgfbeta inhibitor a topical formulation of p has been studied in a phase ii trial involving the treatment of systemic sclerosis or scleroderma a multisystem disorder characterized by the excessive synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins that result in the fibrosis of skin and visceral organsthe data indicated a statistically significant increase in the number of patients that noticed improvements of the treated skin area p  p has also been successfully evaluated in preclinical animal models of organ fibrosis and macular degeneration a medusaenabled formulation of dignas p for controlled release via subcutaneous injection will be developed by flamel for initial evaluation by digna in pulmonary fibrosisp is another tgfbeta inhibitor which has been evaluated in preclinical studies and has shown promising activity for potential application in the treatment of cirrhosis as well as to prevent angiogenesis and metastasis a medusaenabled formulation of dignas p for controlled release via subcutaneous injection will be developed by flamel for evaluation by digna for the potential treatment of multiple indications the joint development agreement anticipates that clinical development of one of the two tgfbeta inhibitors will be prioritized based on preclinical data from the two formulationsmethylthiadenosine mta is an oral immunomodulator that has also been shown to have neuroprotective properties in a variety of animal models  these combined properties make it a strong candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis a micropumpenabled formulation designed specifically to increase both solubility and stability of dignas methylthiadenosine mta will be developed by flamel for evaluation by digna in multiple sclerosisstephen h willard flamels chief executive officer stated “this agreement has been designed to allow both companies to focus on our respective comparative advantages so that we may develop these projects further before partnering this could generate potential greater economic returns for both companies in the three initial products we will be developing as previously announced flamel is reaching out as a complement to our core activities with large pharmaceutical companies to identify and partner with smaller companies with exceptional potential in early stage molecules this can create greater value for shareholders and investors of both companies by advancing highly promising candidates into proof of concept clinical trials we are pleased to be working with digna biotech in the development of these three products which we believe may offer important advantages to patients suffering from a number of serious indications”“all of the molecules subject to this agreement have the potential to become first in class products serving large areas of unmet medical need” commented dr pablo ortiz digna biotechs chief executive officer “our extensive preclinical work on the three molecules has convinced us that each may be applicable in multiple indications by applying flamels drug delivery expertise we expect to improve the applicability of these promising candidates to the indications we are seeking to address we also expect to fuel this collaboration with further innovative molecules in dignas pipeline as we develop further preclinical data in those programmes”p is a synthetic peptide of  amino acids  of human tgfb riii betaglican acting as a tgfbeta  inhibitor as described by ezquerro ij et al  this peptide binds and blocks the biological activity of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta tgfbeta  this cytokine has multiple and potent biological effects over cell growth regulation immunomodulation angiogenesis fibrogenesis and tumor development among others blocking tgfbeta  could be an important factor to limit or reverse fibrosis in different organs and therefore ameliorate various sclerosis conditions digna biotech is investigating other potential indications for disitertide including cardiac fibrosis prosthetic implantinduced fibrosis and wet macular degeneration of retinap is a synthetic peptide of  amino acids selected by phage display on the basis of its ability to bind to human tgfbeta isoforms   and  acting as a tgfbeta  inhibitor as described by dotor j et al   p may be applicable for the treatment of liver fibrosis pulmonary fibrosis metastasis of lung cancer to bone angiogenis melanoma immunosuppression and wet macular degeneration of retinamethylthioadenosine mta is a naturally occurring sulfurcontaining nucleoside present in all mammalian tissues as described by avila ma et al  the combination of immunomodulatory and neuroprotective activity is of particular interest in the potential treatment of numerous indications with high unmet medical need mta may be applicable for the treatment of autoimmune diseases transplant rejection and multiple sclerosis among other potential central nervous disordersthe medusa drug delivery platform consists of proprietary nanogels for the formulation andor the extended release of a broad range of biologics including proteins antibodies peptides

forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this quarterly report overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company utilizing core competencies in drug delivery and formulation to develop safer and more efficacious pharmaceutical products to address unmet medical needs andor reduce overall healthcare costs flamel has a business model consisting of � an unapproved marketed drugs umds business with two approved products in the united states bloxiverzr neostigmine methylsulfate injection and vazculepr phenylephrine hydrochloride injection that are currently marketed a third product akovazr ephedrine sulphate injection for which we obtained fda approval on april   and which we intend to begin marketing in the third quarter of  and a fourth product currently being studied by us for possible submission for review by the fda the umd business was obtained through the acquisition of �clat on march   � a branded pediatric specialty pharmaceutical business with three fda approved products and one fda approved medical device acquired through the acquisition of fsc on february   and � a branded business focusing on the development of products utilizing flamels proprietary drug delivery platforms the branded products that are based on flamels proprietary drug delivery platforms target highvalue solid and liquid oral and alternative dosage forms using b and biosimilar pathways where the company is able to develop strong intellectual property positions and deliver meaningful patient benefits flamels business model allows the company to select develop seek approval for and commercialize niche branded and generic products initially targeted for the us market the company is currently able to selffund the development of most product development opportunities on may   the company announced that the us food and drug administration fda has approved the companys new drug application nda for akovaztm ephedrine sulfate a drug administered parenterally as a pressor agent to address clinically important hypotension in surgical settings the nda which is the first to receive approval from the fda for ephedrine sulfate was approved as scheduled on april   flamel expects to launch akovaz during the third quarter  in a strength of mgml strategy the companys business strategy is designed to drive overall sales and earnings growth while maintaining a return on invested capital at an appropriate premium above the companys cost of capital our key areas of focus address the most significant opportunities and challenges facing the company including � unapproved marketed drug development the company now derives cash flow and profitability from the sales of two of its umd products during the three and six months ended june   the company generated  and  of sales from the umd products compared to  and  in the same period of  respectively o the first umd product bloxiverz which had sales of  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively was approved by the fda on may   and is currently being marketed in the us o the second umd product vazculep which had sales of  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively was approved by the fda on june   and launched in october  in the us o a third umd product akovaz the brand name for the companys ephedrine sulfate injection obtained nda approval on april   we expect to begin marketing this product before september      each of the above products are currently or will be commercialized in the united states by flamels subsidiary �clat these products were derived from the acquisition of �clat which has focused on pursuing fda approvals through the b regulatory pathway through our acquisition of �clat we obtained marketing and licensing knowledge of the commercial and regulatory process in the us and eu we believe this knowledge has enhanced our ability to identify product candidates for development leverage new opportunities for the application of our drug delivery platforms and license and market products in the us and eu the revenues from these umd products are now generating cash flow which we can use to fund our second strategy the development and commercialization of our drug delivery products � development and commercialization of the companys drug delivery pipeline products in addition to the umd strategy the company is continuing to advance the commercialization of its innovative drug delivery platforms we have now enhanced our ability to identify new product candidates and to pursue commercial opportunities associated with our drug delivery platforms the companys drug delivery platforms allow the creation of competitive and differentiated drug product profiles eg with improved pharmacokinetics efficacy andor safety flamel owns and develops drug delivery platforms that address key formulation challenges leading to the development of differentiated drug products for administration in various forms eg capsules tablets sachets or liquid suspensions for oral use or injectables for subcutaneous administration and can be applied to a broad range of drugs novel alreadymarketed or offpatent these product development opportunities allow us to protect our products through patent protection and product differentiation as a result of developing its own drug delivery platforms the companys business is now less dependent on the development activities performed by partners and relies more on the development of its own selffunded products our proprietary drug delivery platforms include o micropumpr is a microparticulate system that allows the development and marketing of modified andor controlled release of solid oral dosage formulations of drugs micropumprcarvedilol and micropumpraspirin formulations have been approved in the us and in the eu respectively o liquitimer allows development of modifiedcontrolled release oral products in a liquid suspension formulation particularly suited to children or for patients having issues swallowing tablets or capsules o trigger locktm allows development of abuseresistant modifiedcontrolled release formulations of narcoticopioid analgesics and other drugs susceptible to abuse o medusatm allows the development of extendedmodified release of injectable dosage formulations of drugs eg peptides polypeptides proteins and small molecules several products formulated using our proprietary drug delivery platforms are currently under various stages of development for possible marketing either by the company andor by partners via licensingdistribution agreements the key elements of our pipeline strategy include o continuing to build commercially successful products utilizing micropump o identifying opportunities and optimizing timetomarket for our not yet approved drug delivery platforms ie liquitime trigger lock and medusa o maximizing the technical potential of our existing drug delivery platforms for developing new and proprietary products and o developing and validating improved and complementary drug delivery platforms related to our current drug delivery capabilities � inorganic growth through acquisitions andor partnerships the company maintains a strong balance sheet with substantial liquidity and little long term debt as part of its overall enterprise strategy the company expects to explore and pursue appropriate inorganic growth opportunities that complement its drug delivery platforms or acquire proprietary products that enhance profitability and cash flow this was evidenced in early  with the acquisition of fsc a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to providing innovative solutions to unmet medical needs for pediatric patients additionally the company will leverage the capabilities of its existing and future proprietary products andor drug delivery platforms with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partnerships or licensing transactions in  the company completed a licensing transaction for its liquitime technologybased otc products which was licensed to elan pharma international limited key business trends and highlights in operating our business and monitoring our performance we consider a number of performance measures as well as trends affecting our industry as a whole which include the following � healthcare and regulatory reform various health care reform laws in the us may impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products and technologies the success of our commercialization efforts may depend on the extent to which the government health administration authorities the health insurance funds in the eu member states private health insurers and other third party payers in the us will reimburse consumers for the cost of healthcare products and services    � pricing environment for pharmaceuticals the pricing environment continues to be in the spotlight of many regulators as a result the need to obtain and maintain appropriate pricing and reimbursement for our products may become more challenging due to among other things the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the us and worldwide � generics playing a larger role in healthcare generic pharmaceutical products will continue to play a large role in the us healthcare system specifically the company has seen additional generic competition to its products and continues to expect generic competition in the future � access to and cost of capital the recent tightening of credit in the us may create challenges for the company if it were to have the need to raise capital currently the company has no needs to raise capital highlights of our condensed consolidated results for the six months ended june   are as follows � revenue was  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively compared to  and  in the same periods last year this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in bloxiverz sales volume as a result of additional competition partially offset by an increase in sales volume and pricing of vazculep � operating loss was  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively compared to operating loss of  and operating income of  in the same periods last year � net loss was  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively compared to  and  in the same periods last year these increases were largely driven by a decrease in sales and increases in selling general and administrative expenses in the current year � diluted net loss per share was  and  for the three and six months ended june   respectively compared to  and  in the same periods last year � cash and marketable securities increased  to  from  at december   critical accounting estimates the companys condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to prepare these financial statements management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could be significantly different from these estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note  of the audited consolidated financial statements included in our  form k the sec suggests companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application our estimates are often based on complex judgments probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable it is also possible that other professionals applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts for a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies see the critical accounting policies section of the mda in our  form k there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies with the exception of changes made to our revenue recognition policy disclosed below during the six months ended june   revenue revenue includes sales of pharmaceutical products amortization of licensing fees milestone payments for rd achievements and compensation for the execution of rd activities product sales and services revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured the company records revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer which is typically upon delivery to the customer and when the selling price is determinable as is customary in the pharmaceutical industry the companys gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at reported net product sales these adjustments include estimates for product returns chargebacks payment discounts rebates and other sales allowances and are estimated based on analysis of historical data for the product or comparable products as well as future expectations for such products for generic products and branded products sold in mature markets where the ultimate net selling price to customer is estimable the company recognizes revenues upon shipment to the wholesaler for new product launches the company recognizes revenue once sufficient data is available to determine product acceptance in the marketplace such that product returns may be estimated based on historical data and there is evidence of reorders and consideration is made of wholesaler inventory levels    prior to the second quarter  the company did not have sufficient historical data to estimate certain revenue deductions as such it could not accurately estimate the ultimate net selling price of its �clat portfolio of products and as a result delayed revenue recognition until the wholesaler sold the product through to its customers during the second quarter of  the company determined that it has sufficient evidence history data and internal controls to estimate the ultimate selling price of its products upon shipment from its warehouse to its customers the wholesalers accordingly it discontinued the sell through revenue approach and now recognizes revenue once the product is shipped from its warehouse as a result of this change in accounting estimate the company recognized  in additional revenue for the three and six months ended june   that previously would have been deferred until sold by the wholesalers to the hospitals the impact of this change is reflected as revenue in the companys condensed consolidated statements of loss for the periods reported license and research revenue the companys license and research revenues consist of fees and milestone payments nonrefundable fees where we have continuing performance obligations are deferred and are recognized ratably over our projected performance period we recognize milestone payments which are typically related to regulatory commercial or other achievements by us or our licensees and distributors as revenues when the milestone is accomplished and collection is reasonably assured    aug   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage microsoft rides huge tax benefit from
