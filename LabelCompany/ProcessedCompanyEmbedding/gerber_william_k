for defendant anderson clayton  company frank j kelley attorney general robert a derengoski solicitor general harry g iwasko jr and marc a goldman assistants attorney general for director corporation and securities bureau before rb burns pj and allen and de holbrook jr jj per curiam this is an appeal of right from a judgment of the newaygo county circuit court made final pursuant to gcr   dismissing count i of plaintiffs complaint a petition for superintending control for lack of jurisdiction this litigation arises out of a takeover offer made by anderson clayton  co as delay in decision would work to the detriment of anderson clayton and in light of the fact plaintiff has filed a motion to expedite the appeal we peremptorily remand this cause pursuant to gcr    for further proceedings consistent with this opinion regarding the jurisdictional issues in holding that it lacked authority to issue mandamus to the director corporation and securities bureau department of commerce a state official the circuit court seems to have overlooked recently enacted  pa  mcla  msa a amending rja §  to provide that mandamus may be brought at the plaintiffs option in this court the circuit court for the county of ingham or any other circuit court of proper venue furthermore the circuit court had jurisdiction to  issue an order of superintending control gcr   chrysler corp v civil rights commission  mich app   nwd   radke v employment security commission  mich app   nwd   the question of whether to issue the writ is distinct from the power to do so here issuance would depend on whether the director abused his quasijudicial discretion either by denying gerbers request for hearing or by accepting anderson claytons registration statement as being in compliance with mcla  msa  due to basic securities economics and the omnipresent possibility of market manipulation during any period of uncertainty following public disclosure of the existence of a takeover offer time is of the essence and appeal is not a speedy remedy under the circumstances in lieu thereof superintending control may therefore be sought cf gcr   oakland county prosecutor v th district judge  mich app    nwd   in enacting  pa  mcla  msa  the legislature intended to insure that affected securities investors could make informed decisions regarding management changes accomplished through the medium of takeover offers thereby buttressing public confidence in securities as a medium of investment hr rep no  th cong d sess reprinted in  us code cong  ad news  and to emphasize to the investor the potential effect of his decision on the michigan economy as evidenced by mcla c h msa c h accordingly the statutory requirement that the offeror provide material information must be construed in this light moore v department of military affairs  mich    nwd    material information is anything of which an average prudent investor ought reasonably to be informed before deciding whether to buy sell or hold an affected security  cfr    applied in gilbert v nixon  fd   ca   and johns hopkins university v hutton  fd   ca   if a reasonable investor would consider a particular item of information important in making such a decision that fact is material per se affiliated ute citizens of utah v united states  us    s ct   l ed d   gerber makes  allegations of omission of material information and error on the part of the director of the corporation and securities bureau of the michigan department of commerce who is the administrator of takeover and tender offer matters the first allegation of a material omission in the registration statement is the failure to disclose anderson claytons plans with regard to changing the number of employees in this state as required by § c of  pa  mcla c msa c gerber notes that the registration statement asserts anderson clayton has no present intention of significantly reducing production facilities but makes no specific mention of plans regarding the  nonproduction workers employed by gerber aside from the production workers the remaining gerber workers perform functions which are in large part duplicated in anderson claytons houstondallas facilities the answer to this allegation is that it is untrue the registration statement part vii d states except as stated in such information there are no plans or proposals or negotiations which the offeror has  to liquidate gerber products company sell its assets effect its merger or consolidation change the number of its employees in michigan or change the terms and conditions of their employment or make any other substantial change in its business corporate structure management or employees upon gaining control second gerber contends that the proposed takeover will affect the terms and conditions of employment of gerber employees by affecting their pension plan value and retirement benefits and third that the disclosure statements do not contain a discussion of the adverse tax consequences which will befall gerber workers in light of the present state of the federal tax law these allegations lack apparent merit gerber notes that as of december    gerber employees were participants in the retirement investment plan which by its own terms is required to invest in gerber stock and holds some  shares however the retirement investment plan whether deemed a pension plan deferred compensation plan employee stock option plan or other retirement benefit plan is exempt from taxation  usca  irc  treasury regs  should the retirement investment plan sell some of its  shares to tender offeror it will pay no taxes on the gain because it is tax exempt and there will be no tax consequences on the employees until such time as there is a distribution of the funds through payments of retirement benefits  usca a irc  treasury reg a the fact that in order to take advantage of the highly favorable tender offer the retirement investment plan may need to be amended so as to allow investments in things other than shares of gerber corporation is a minor detail easily effectuated without adverse tax consequences  furthermore any employee can transfer within certain time limits rights from one pension fund to another qualified pension fund without any tax consequences as anderson clayton has specifically announced in its disclosure statements that it intends to effect no change in the existing retirement plan gerbers allegations are seen to be invalid both factually and legally fourth gerber contends that the disclosure statement should specify that if the retirement investment plan retains its  shares of gerber or some of them the value of these shares will be affected by the fact that the company is controlled by anderson clayton and that such shares therefore constitute a minority interest which may be of diminished value no reason to make such disclosure appears where such is the effect of any takeover in any company disclosure statements are designed to inform the existing stockholders of the kind of new management control he can expect in his company so he can determine whether or not to retain his shares contribute to the takeover by accepting the tender or sell his shares on the open market and in effect abstain from the decision nothing in the philosophy of disclosure requires that investors be given lessons in the basic rules of the investment game concerning majority and minority shareholding moreover anderson clayton has specifically acknowledged in several of the exhibits which are letters to the defendant administrator that it regards itself as a fiduciary with respect to the minority shareholders and is prepared to be held accountable for its subsequent actions should the takeover succeed fifth gerber contends that the disclosure statement is misleading in discussing antitrust implications the disclosure statement notes that in any  such acquisition by a company as large as anderson clayton of a company the size of gerber there are always unpredictable antitrust consequences and the acquisition might well be blocked by federal officials through legal action however the disclosure statement notes that anderson claytons special counsel has advised it that no antitrust violation is involved gerbers answer to this is that the federal trade commission has begun an investigation of the proposed takeover and that this should be disclosed in the takeover registration statement gerber relies on hill york corp v american international franchises inc  fd  ca   the hill york case is totally inapposite to the present case that involved a pyramid scheme and the court found numerous misleading and material omissions where purchasers were given a brochure representing that the defendant promoters of the franchise operation had just left a very successful firm without disclosing the fact that the firm was under investigation by the ftc other misleading statements involved included a claim that one of the defendant promoters was an expert in capitalization consulting when he had no experience in this field the brochure claimed that the franchise fee was  when in actuality it was  plus  per month royalty finally the brochure claimed that existing sales centers were operating successfully but it failed to disclose that most of such centers were under investigation by various state securities commissions sixth gerber does have a solid point when it notes that allowing the opinion of special counsel to be circulated in this fashion is misleading because the opinion was rendered prior to the commencement of the ftc investigation furthermore the opinion seems dubious in light of existing  precedent since a major food processor such as anderson clayton is always a threat to enter related food markets its acquisition of the dominant company in the baby food market might well run afoul of §  of the clayton act  usca §  federal trade commission v procter  gamble co  us   s ct   l ed d   the importance of clearly and fully disclosing in the registration statement the existence of the ftc investigation and of attenuating the force of the special counsels opinion can be seen by considering the investors decision whether to accept the tender offer or to retain some of his shares should the tender be accepted as to only part of his holdings if the acquisition later results in an ftc decision to compel divestiture under the clayton act the market would be flooded with gerber shares which anderson clayton would have to dispose of this would grossly depress the stock price of gerber and consequently reduce the liquidity and value of the holdings of all other investors owning gerber stock faced with that grim possibility many investors might well decide not to tender their shares seven gerber alleges that the disclosure statement makes no mention of anderson claytons admissions to the sec in form k filed may  and february  admitting payment of inducements to foreign officials in order to assist anderson clayton operations in other countries instead the disclosure statement acknowledges only that it is alleged that such payments have been made and denies each of the material allegations anderson clayton defended this omission by  noting that copies of form k are available from the sec or from the department of commerce but placing such a burden of discovery on the investor seems unreasonable when it could be disclosed in the body of the required registration statement thus we find merit in gerbers allegation on this issue eight the next allegation by gerber is that anderson clayton has failed to properly disclose the source and amount of funds to be used in acquiring the gerber stock a requirement of § b of  pa  mcla b msa b this allegation is without factual support in the file are loan commitment papers in the amount of  million dollars from morgan guarantee trust company and manufacturers hanover bank two of the largest financial institutions in the country gerber contends that anderson clayton has not established its ability to pay back the loans but this argument seems weak in light of anderson claytons observation that institutions such as morgan guarantee trust do not loan out hundreds of millions of dollars without being assured that repayment will be forthcoming nine gerber contends that through carefully placed press releases anderson clayton has violated §  of  pa  by engaging in manipulative acts or practices in connection with a tender offer mcla  msa  gerber gives no explanation as to why the act should be construed to limit the first amendment right of an offeror to reveal its plans to the news media the only thing manipulative about anderson claytons actions in this regard is that the  per share offer is so tempting it may well create a stampede something gerber management understandably finds threatening to its continued employment security  ten it is argued that anderson clayton by purchasing  shares of gerber stock within  days of the tendering period violated §  of  pa  mcla  msa  however §  merely prohibits the purchase of any shares for  days after the effective date of a tender offer nowhere in the act is there any mention of purchasing shares prior to the effective date of a takeover offer furthermore every court which has previously considered the issue has held that purchase of shares on the open market does not constitute a tender offer for purposes of regulatory legislation gulf  western industries inc v great atlantic  pacific tea co inc  f supp  sd ny  affd without mentioning this point  fd  ca   water  wall associates inc v american consumer industries inc  cch fed sec l rep ¶   dc nj  dz investment co v holloway  cch fed sec l rep ¶   sd ny  nachman corp v halfred inc  cch fed sec l rep ¶   nd ill   pa  accords recognition to this principle by exempting from the definition of takeover offer in § c the acquisition of an equity security pursuant to an offer effected by or through a brokerdealer in the ordinary course of his business mcla c msa c eleven last is the question of the propriety of the directors decision not to grant gerber a hearing as the director noted in letters to counsel for gerber as originally introduced  house bill no  would have required the director to order a hearing upon request of the target company unless prior thereto the administrator calls a hearing  with respect to the offer the administrator may call a hearing if necessary or appropriate for the protection of offerees in this state and shall call a hearing if requested by the target company as enacted however §  provides simply that the effective date of a takeover offer may be stayed by the director if the administrator orders a hearing for    the alleged violation of this act mcla  msa  given the exigencies of securities trading the statute should be construed as requiring a hearing only where there are substantial grounds for believing that a prima facie case establishing a violation of the act can be made gerber seeks a hearing for the purpose of examining under oath executives of anderson clayton regarding the truth of statements in the registration statement now pending we agree with the director that he need not hold such hearing if the registration statement discloses all material facts as required by the act the averments therein may be accepted by the director as true should subsequent events establish the falsity of any statement in the registration statement the act provides ample remedies by way of rescission of any sale or purchase on petition of the director attorney general or prosecuting attorney of the appropriate county mcla  msa  investors are protected by being able to file an action to recover the security plus any income received thereon by the purchaser together with interest costs and reasonable attorneys fees mcla  msa  the potential imposition of such draconian penalties provides sufficient assurance of the truth of statements made in the registration statement for the purpose of allowing a takeover effort to proceed  in conclusion we hold that the trial court did have jurisdiction to issue a writ of superintending control we further find against gerber on  of the  charges of material omission in the registration filed by defendant and approved by the director nevertheless we conclude that in two respects the registration statement requires fuller disclosure this cause is therefore remanded to the newaygo county circuit court with instructions to supervise the supplementation of the registration statement so as to provide full fair and truthful disclosure of possible antitrust consequences and of past payments to foreign officials as disclosed in previously filed forms k promulgated by the sec the restraining order entered by the circuit court on may   shall be continued until the circuit court and the director are satisfied that the registration statement truthfully fairly and fully discloses all material matters pursuant to gcr   the clerk is hereby ordered to issue final process in this cause forthwith no costs neither party having prevailed in full notes  anderson clayton controls nationally  of the pourable salad dressing market  of the butter substitute market inter alia
