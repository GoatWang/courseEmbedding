malls premium outletsr and the millsr as of december   we owned or held an interest in  income�producing properties in the united states which consisted of  malls  premium outlets  mills four lifestyle centers and  other retail properties in  states and puerto rico in addition we have redevelopment and expansion projects including the addition of anchors big box tenants and restaurants underway at  properties in the united states and we have one outlet and one other significant retail project under development internationally as of december   we had ownership interests in nine

austria germany the netherlands and the united kingdom we also have four international outlet properties under development as of december   we owned a  equity stake in klepierre sa or klepierre a publicly traded paris�based real estate company which owns or has an interest in shopping centers located in  countries in europe we generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including � base minimum rents � overage and percentage rents based on tenants sales volume and � recoverable expenditures such as property operating real estate taxes repair and maintenance and advertising and promotional expenditures revenues of our management company after intercompany eliminations consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation we seek growth in earnings funds from operations or ffo and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments we seek to accomplish this growth through the following � attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses � expanding and re�tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates � selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets � generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances and � selling selective non�core assets we also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities � establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer�focused corporate alliances including payment systems such as handling fees relating to the sales of table of contents bank�issued prepaid cards national marketing alliances static and digital media initiatives business development sponsorship and events � offering property operating services to our tenants and others including waste handling and facility services and the provision of energy services � selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties commonly referred to as outlots or outparcels and � generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans including those made to related entities we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk�reward criteria we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk to support our growth we employ a three�fold capital strategy � provide the capital necessary to fund growth � maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms both public and private and � manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings we consider ffo net operating income or noi and comparable property noi noi for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion results overview diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit decreased  during  to  as compared to  in  the decrease in diluted earnings per share and

statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements � we as a lessor retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases we accrue minimum rents on a straight�line basis over the terms of their respective leases substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year we recognize overage rents only when each tenants sales exceed its sales threshold � we review investment properties for impairment on a property�by�property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable these circumstances include but are not limited to a decline in a propertys cash flows occupancy or comparable sales per square foot we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property to the extent impairment has occurred we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value we may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values we also review our investments including investments in unconsolidated entities if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other�than�temporary changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results table of contents � to maintain simons status as a reit we must distribute at least  of reit taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact simons reit status in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain simons reit status and available relief provisions do not apply we would be required to pay us federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period simon did not qualify as a reit if simon lost its reit status it could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless its failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met as a result failing to maintain reit status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods � we make estimates as part of our valuation of the purchase price of acquisitions including the components of excess investment in joint ventures to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component the most significant components of our valuations are typically the determination of fair value to the buildings as�if�vacant land and market value of in�place leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of in�place leases we make our best estimates of the tenants ability to pay rents based upon the tenants operating performance at the property including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf rents psf and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in�place leases � a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include pre�construction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening results of operations in addition to the activity discussed above in the results overview section the following acquisitions openings and dispositions of consolidated properties affected our consolidated results from continuing operations in the comparative periods � during  we disposed of three retail properties � during the first quarter of  we consolidated two designer outlet properties in europe that had
