scotia a campaign that led to the thenlargest majority in canadian history after graduating from st francis xavier with a degree in political science in  mulroney at first pursued a law degree from

mulroney built a network of friends including lucien bouchard bernard roy michel cogger michael meighen and jean bazin that would play a prominent role in canadian politics for years to come during this time mulroney was still involved in the conservative youth wing and was acquainted with the president of the student federation joe clarkcitation needed mulroney secured a plum temporary appointment in ottawa during the summer of  as the executive assistant to alvin hamilton minister of agriculture then a federal election was called and prime minister diefenbaker appointed hamilton as the acting prime minister for the rest of the campaign hamilton took mulroney with him on the campaign trail where the young organizer gained valuable experience builds reputation gains publicity after graduating from laval in  mulroney joined the montreal law firm now known as norton rose fulbright which at the time was the largest law firm in the commonwealth of nations mulroney twice failed his bar exams but the firm kept him due to his charming personality after ultimately passing his bar exams mulroney was admitted to the quebec bar in  and became a labour lawyer which was then a new and exciting field of law in quebec mulroneys superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation with opponents often polarized and at odds proved ideal for this field he was noted for ending several strikes along the montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer w david angus of stikeman elliott who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaignscitation needed in  dalton camp who by then was president of the progressive conservative party ran for reelection in what many believed to be a referendum on diefenbakers leadership diefenbaker had reached his th birthday in  mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting camp and opposing diefenbaker but due to his past friendship with diefenbaker he attempted to stay out of the spotlight with camps narrow victory diefenbaker called for a  leadership convention in toronto mulroney joined with joe clark and others in supporting former justice minister e davie fulton once fulton dropped off the ballot mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to robert stanfield who won mulroney then  would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in quebeccitation needed mulroneys professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the montreal newspaper la presse in doing so mulroney and the papers owner canadian business mogul paul desmarais became friends after his initial difficulties mulroneys reputation in his firm steadily increased and he was made a partner in  mulroneys big break came during the cliche commission in  which was set up by quebec premier robert bourassa to investigate the situation at james bay canadas largest hydroelectric project violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle to ensure the commission was nonpartisan bourassa the liberal premier placed robert cliche a former leader of the provincial new democratic party in charge cliche asked mulroney a progressive conservative and a former student of his to join the commission mulroney asked lucien bouchard to join as counsel the committees proceedings which showed mafia infiltration of the unions made mulroney well known in quebec as the hearings were extensively covered in the media the cliche commissions report was largely adopted by the bourassa government a notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the premier of quebec although bouchard favoured calling in robert bourassa as a witness mulroney refused deeming it a violation of executive privilege mulroney and bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when mulroney ran for reelection in  loses first leadership race – the stanfieldled progressive conservatives lost the  election to the pierre trudeauled liberals leading to stanfields resignation as leader mulroney despite never having run for elected office entered the contest to replace him mulroney and provincial rival claude wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the partys standing in quebec which had supported the federal liberals for decades mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting wagner to the pc party a few years earlier and the two wound up as rivals for quebec delegates most of whom were snared by wagner who even blocked mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention in the leadership race mulroney spent an estimated  far more than the other candidates and earned himself the nickname cadillac candidate at the  leadership convention mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind wagner however his expensive campaign slick image lack of parliamentary experience and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates and he was unable to build upon his base support being overtaken by eventual winner joe clark on the second ballot mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses and his campaign finished deeply in debt following the convention mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in clarks caucus business leadership mulroney took the job of executive vice president of the iron ore company of canada a joint subsidiary of three major us steel corporations mulroney earned a salary well into the sixfigure range in  he was appointed company president drawing upon his labour law experience he instituted improved labour relations and with commodity prices on the rise company profits soared during the next several years in  mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the schefferville mine winning a generous settlement for the affected workers under his leadership the company was sold off to foreign interests in the wake of his loss in the  leadership race mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years he credits his loyal wife mila with helping him recover in  he permanently became a teetotaler during his ioc term he made liberal use of the companys executive jet frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country as his business reputation grew he was invited onto several corporate boards he declined an offer to run in a quebec byelection as a federal liberal party leader joe clark led the progressive conservative party to a minority government in the  federal election which ended  years of continuous liberal rule however the government fell after a successful noconfidence motion over his minority governments budget in december  the pcs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to trudeau and the liberals many tories were also annoyed with clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in june  by late  joe clarks leadership of the progressive conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many tory members of parliament despite his solid national lead over prime minister pierre trudeau in opinion polls which stretched to  percent in summer  mulroney on the floor of the  leadership convention photograph by alasdair roberts mulroney while publicly endorsing clark at a press conference in  organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the partys leadership review clarks key quebec organizer rodrigue pageau was in fact a double agent working for mulroney undermining clarks support when clark received an endorsement by only  per cent of delegates at the party convention in january  in winnipeg he resigned and ran to regain his post at the  leadership convention despite still not being a member of parliament mulroney ran against him campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before mulroney had been criticized in  for lacking policy depth and substance a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early s which were collected into a book where i stand published in  mulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign for which he had been criticized mulroney was elected party leader on june   beating clark on the fourth ballot attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native quebec two months later mulroney entered parliament as the mp for central nova in nova scotia winning a byelection in what was then considered a safe tory seat after elmer mackay stood aside in his favour this is a common practice in most parliamentary systems throughout his political career mulroneys fluency in english and french with quebec roots in both cultures gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive because of health problems shortly after becoming party leader mulroney quit smoking in  by the start of  as mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the house of commons the tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling it was almost taken for granted that trudeau would be heavily defeated by mulroney in the general election due no later than  trudeau announced his retirement in february and the liberal party chose john turner previously the minister of finance under trudeau in the s as its new leader the liberals then surged in the polls to take a lead after trailing by more than  percentage points only four days after being sworn in as prime minister turner called a general election for september in so doing he had to postpone a planned canadian summer visit by queen elizabeth ii who makes it her policy to not travel abroad during foreign election campaigns but the liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray leading to a weak campaign the campaign is best remembered for mulroneys attacks on a raft of liberal patronage appointments in his final days in office trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of senators judges and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards widely seen as a way to offer plum jobs to loyal members of the liberal party upon assuming office turner who had been out of politics for nine years while he earned a lucrative salary as a toronto lawyer showed that his political instincts had diminished he had been under pressure to advise sauvé to cancel the appointments—which convention would have required sauvé to do however turner chose not to do so and instead proceeded to appoint several more liberals to prominent political offices per a signed legal agreement with trudeau ironically turner had planned to attack mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory in a televised leaders debate turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old union nationale in quebec however mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of liberal patronage appointments he demanded that turner apologize to the country for making these horrible appointments turner replied that i had no option except to let the appointments stand mulroney famously responded you had an option sir you could have said i am not going to do it this is wrong for canada and i am not going to ask canadians to pay the price you had an option sir—to say no—and you chose to say yes to the old attitudes and the old stories of the liberal party that sir if i may say respectfully is not good enough for canadians turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from mulroney he could repeat only i had no option a visibly angry mulroney called this an avowal of failure and a confession of nonleadership the exchange led most papers the next day with most of them paraphrasing mulroneys counterattack as you had an option sir—you could have said no many observers believe that at this point mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister on september  mulroney and the tories won the largest majority government in canadian history they took  seats three more than their previous record in  the liberals won only  seats which at the time was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in canadian history the conservatives won just over half of the popular vote compared to  percent in  and led in every province emerging as a national party for the first time since  especially important was the tories performance in mulroneys home province quebec the tories had only won the most seats in that province once since  – the  tory landslide however largely due to anger at trudeau and mulroneys promise of a new deal for quebec the province swung over dramatically to support him the tories had only won one seat out of  in  but took  seats in  mulroney yielded central nova back to mackay and instead ran in the eastern quebec riding of manicouagan which included baiecomeau in  the canadian press named mulroney newsmaker of the year for the second straight year making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister the other being lester pearson prime minister – first mandate – mila left and brian right mulroney greet rt hon pierre trudeau foreground the first conservative majority government in  years—and only the second in  years—initially seemed to give mulroney a very formidable position the tories had won just over half the popular vote and no other party crossed the seat mark on paper he was free to take canada in any direction he wanted however his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest his support was based on a grand coalition of socially conservative populists from the west quebec nationalists and fiscal conservatives from ontario and atlantic canada such diverse interests became difficult for mulroney to juggle he attempted to appeal to the western provinces whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success by cancelling the national energy program and including a large number of westerners in his cabinet including clark as minister of external affairs however he was not completely successful even aside from economic and constitutional policy for example he moved cf servicing from manitoba to quebec in  even though the manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated and received death threats for exerting pressure on manitoba over french language rights many of mulroneys ministers had little government experience resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals many tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government indeed mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage including the reference to ambassador bryce mackasey as theres no whore like an old whore the new prime ministers handlers were concerned by apparent unpredictability and rumours of drinking mila left and brian right mulroney at andrews air force base in september  one of mulroneys main priorities was to lower the deficit which had increased from  billion under lester b pearson to  billion under pierre eliott trudeau however the countrys debt increased during mulroneys term from  billion to  billion his attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises also impeding his progress was the senate where the liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power led by allan maceachen the senate took a very assertive role in legislation forcing the government to compromise on several points despite its considerable house majority a major undertaking by mulroneys government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity quebec was the only province that did not sign the new canadian constitution negotiated by prime minister pierre trudeau in  and mulroney wanted to include quebec in a new agreement with the rest of canada in  he negotiated the meech lake accord with the provincial premiers a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy quebecs demand for recognition as a distinct society within canada and to devolve some powers to the provinces the mulroneys with president and mrs reagan in quebec canada march   the day after the famous shamrock summit when the two leaders sang when irish eyes are smiling another of mulroneys priorities was the privatization of many of canadas crown corporations in  the government of canada held  different crown corporations it sold off  of them including air canada which was completely privatized by  although the air canada public participation act continued to make certain requirements of the airline petrocanada was also later privatized the air india flight  bombing which originated in montreal happened during mulroneys first term this was the largest terrorist act before september   with the majority of the  victims being canadian citizens mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then indian prime minister rajiv gandhi which sparked an uproar in canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to mulroney given that the majority of victims were canadian or lived in canada many indocanadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt mulroney did not consider them to be true canadian citizens as they were not of european descentcitation needed furthermore there were several warnings from the indian government to the mulroney government about terrorist threats towards air india flights questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented the governor generalincouncil in  appointed the former supreme court justice john major to conduct a commission of inquiry his report was completed and released on  june  near the end of his first term mulroney gave a formal apology and a  million compensation package to the families of the  japanese canadians who had been divested of their property and interned during world war ii foreign policy mulroneys government opposed the apartheid regime in south africa and he met with many of the regimes opposition leaders throughout his tenure his position put him at odds with the american and british governments but also won him respect elsewhere also external affairs minister joe clark was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated ethiopia to lead the western response to the – famine in that country clark landed in addis ababa so quickly he had not even seen the cbc report that had created the initial and strong public reaction canadas response was overwhelming and led the usa and britain to follow suit almost immediately — an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time since ethiopia had a marxist regime and had previously been isolated by western governments the mulroney government also took a strong stand against the us intervention in nicaragua under reagan and accepted refugees from el salvador guatemala and other countries with repressive regimes supported directly by the reagan administration free trade during his tenure as prime minister brian mulroneys close relationship with us president ronald reagan helped secure a landmark treaty on acid rain and the ratification of a freetrade treaty with the united states under which all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by  critics noted that mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the  leadership campaign this agreement was controversial and the senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote the canadaus free trade agreement was the central issue of the  election with the liberals and ndp opposing it with the liberals gaining the initial momentum a successful counterattack by allan gregg resulted in the pcs being reelected with a solid but reduced majority and  percent of the popular vote mulroney thus became the only conservative in the th century to lead his party to consecutive majority governments during peacetime in this election mulroney transferred to another eastern quebec seat charlevoix after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include baiecomeau on election day november   mulroney made a controversial order in council which allowed the establishment of the amex bank of canada owned by american express second mandate – mulroneys second term was marked by an economic recession he proposed the introduction of a national sales tax the goods and services tax gst in  when it was introduced in  it replaced the manufacturers sales tax mst that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in canada a bitter senate battle ensued and many polls showed that as many as  of canadians were opposed to the tax mulroney had to use section  the deadlock clause a little known constitutional provision allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the queen to appoint  new senators although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase but a tax shift the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular and many resented mulroneys use of an emergency clause in the constitution the meech lake accord also met its doom in  it was not ratified by the provincial governments of manitoba and newfoundland before the june ratification deadline this failure sparked a revival of quebec separatism and led to another round of meetings in charlottetown in  and  these negotiations culminated in the charlottetown accord which outlined extensive changes to the constitution including recognition of quebec as a distinct society however the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in october  many blamed the gst battle and mulroneys unpopularity for the fall of the accord in  mulroney nominated ray hnatyshyn an mp from saskatoon and a former cabinet minister to be governor general – on december   canada became the first western nation to recognize ukraine as an independent country next day after the landslide referendum in favor of independence in ukraine nafta initialing ceremony october  from left to right standing mexican president salinas us president bush prime minister mulroney seated jaime serra puche carla hills michael wilson the worldwide recession of the early s significantly damaged the governments financial situation mulroneys inability to improve the governments finances as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his probusiness plan which had increased the deficit at the same time the bank of canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in canada annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels reaching  billion in his last year of office these deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of  of gdp further weakening the canadian dollar and damaging canadas international credit rating mulroney supported the united nations coalition during the  gulf war and when the un authorized full use of force in the operation canada sent a cf squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of the royal canadian regiment to safeguard these ground elements calling canadas participation operation friction in august he sent the destroyers hmcs terra nova and hmcs athabaskan to enforce the trade blockade against iraq the supply ship hmcs protecteur was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces when the air war began canadas planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets this was the first time since the fighting on cyprus in  that canadian forces participated directly in combat operations for the canadian forces the mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment most members of the cf welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services replacing the single green uniform worn since unification – a white paper proposed boosting the cfs combat capability which had according to canadian defence quarterly declined so badly that canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the gulf war had it desired to the cf in this period did undergo a muchneeded modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms many proposed reforms however failed to occur and according to historian jl granatstein mulroney raised the militarys hopes repeatedly but failed to deliver in  he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to  troops but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below  by  this was however in step with other nato countries after the end of the cold war the mulroney government undertook a defence policy review publishing a new statement in late  but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the post cold war era was arrived at before the governments defeat in  according to granatstein this meant that canada was not able to live up to its postcold war military commitments the decline of cod stocks in atlantic canada led the mulroney government to impose a moratorium on the cod fishery there putting an end to a large portion of the newfoundland fishing industry and causing serious economic hardship the government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the atlantic provinces the environment was a key focus of mulroneys government as canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the un conference on the environment his government added significant new national parks bruce peninsula south moresby and grasslands and passed the canadian environmental assessment act and canadian environmental protection act retirement widespread public resentment of the goods and services tax an economic slump the fracturing of his political coalition and his lack of results regarding the quebec situation caused mulroneys popularity to decline considerably during his second term an ominous sign was a  byelection in the alberta riding of beaver river in this election called when tory mp john dahmer died before ever having a chance to attend a sitting reform party candidate deborah grey won by a hefty  votes after finishing fourth in the general election just five months earlier this was perhaps the first sign that mulroneys grand coalition was fracturing the pcs had dominated albertas federal politics since the  election another sign came before meech lake was finalized when bouchard resigned from both the cabinet and the party over changes to the proposal that he felt diluted its spirit after the failure of meech bouchard convinced several other tories to break with the party and join him to form the bloc québécois a prosovereigntist ie independentist party years later mulroney said that his biggest error as prime minister had been trusting his former university friend indeed he and bouchard have not spoken to each other in over two decades mulroney entered  facing a statutory general election under canadian law federal governments can have a maximum duration of five years but they often have lesser duration as they must enjoy the confidence of the house of commons in order to continue in office by this time his approval ratings had dipped into the teens and were at  in a  gallup poll making him one of the most unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in canada in the s there was a consensus that mulroney would be heavily defeated by jean chrétien and the liberals if he led the tories into the next election—ironically the same situation that led to trudeaus departure from the scene nine years earlier he announced his retirement from politics in february and was replaced as prime minister by defence minister kim campbell in june the last gallup poll taken before his retirement in february  showed his approval ratings had rebounded to  in his final days in office mulroney made several decisions that hampered the tory campaign later that year he took a lavish international farewell tour mostly at taxpayers expense without transacting any official business also by the time he handed power to campbell there were only twoandahalf months left in the tories fiveyear mandate further compounding the problem mulroney continued to live at  sussex drive for some time after campbell was sworn in as prime minister brian and mila mulroneys new private residence in montreal was undergoing renovations and they did not move out of  sussex until their new home was ready instead campbell took up residence at harrington lake the prime ministers official summer retreat across the river in gatineau park quebec the  election was a disaster for the tories the oldest party in canada was reduced from a majority with  seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level the seat loss far exceeded the seat loss the liberals suffered in  the tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the house of commons since the required minimum number of seats for official party status is  as an example of the antipathy toward mulroney his former riding fell to the bloc by a lopsided margin the tory candidate finished a distant third with only  votes—just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit in her memoirs time and chance and in her response in the national post to the secret mulroney tapes campbell said that mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the tories reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off campbell went as far as to claim that mulroney knew the tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election and wanted a scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity rather than a true successor airbusschreiber affair main article airbus affair in  mulroney settled a libel lawsuit he had brought against the government of canada two years previously mulroney received an apology and a  million reimbursement for legal and public relations costs at issue were allegations that mulroney had accepted bribes in the airbus affair concerning government contracts the government said the charges could not be substantiated the principal royal canadian mounted police rcmp investigator on the case retired a year later the government later dropped the investigation entirely but a key fact was unknown in  and had not been elicited under sworn testimony in which mulroney had denied business dealings or significant meetings with a business associate mulroney later confirmed that he had personally accepted cash payments from his business associate karlheinz schreiber a germancanadian businessman who had been a paid broker for airbus and other companies the cash changed hands in three secret meetings in hotels in montreal and new york city in brown paper bags of  bills totaling either  according to mulroney or  according to schrieber the payments occurred over an month period beginning in  when mulroney had stepped down as prime minister but was still a member of parliament in  mulroney stated that he had kept the cash paid in new york in a new york safe deposit box thus implying that he had not illegally carried it undeclared across the uscanada border and in a safe in his montreal home the cash payments had not then been declared as income for tax purposes schreiber had at his disposal  million from airbus for the payment of secret commissions cbc television reported on february   that the money schreiber paid to mulroney originated in a swiss bank account codenamed frankfurt schreiber used the same account to pay the secret airbus commissions schreiber transferred  from frankfurt to an account in zürich codenamed britan on july   and used these funds to make the three cash payments to mulroney in  and  five years after the payments began mulroney and schreiber met again in a suite at the hotel savoy in zurich switzerland schreiber claims mulroney tried to extract a promise schreiber would never reveal the payments schreiber also claims mulroneys attorneys later tried to induce him into perjury by asking that he sign an affidavit falsely stating that he had never paid any money to mulroney mulroney denies this and also denies schreibers claim that the payments totaled  testifying before the house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney said the cash payments were for lobbying foreign leaders to buy armored vehicles from thyssen industries a company schreiber represented mulroney said schreiber had paid him as a consultant for this task only in the context of the potential bear head project which had actually been canceled three years prior to his accepting payment mulroney said he never had a written contract made written reports or issued receipts for the cash payments mulroney said he had destroyed records related to the transactions and received the payments in cash mulroney denied any illegal wrongdoing he admitted to errors in judgment and apologized for the impropriety mulroney described the public revelation of his wrongdoing as a near death experience and said his family had suffered greatly for many years mulroney had not acknowledged receiving money from schreiber the payments were concealed in mulroneys  lawsuit against the government of canada mulroney falsely testified under oath that he never had any dealings with schreiber knew him only peripherally and they had a cup of coffee once or twice in his  book a secret trial former law professor william kaplan describes mulroneys testimony as evasive incomplete and misleading in his testimony schreiber made allegations that described a canadian party leader subverted and deposed by foreign interests of federal contracts being used to funnel money back to those interests of bidrigging and kickbacks mulroney and schreiber question each others truthfulness and credibility in his testimony to the canadian house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney pointed out contradictory statements schreiber has made over the years including statements made under oath mulroney also stated that the work he had performed for his armstrading business associate schreiber was outofcountry rather than lobbying his own canadian government – such as lobbying the late president boris yeltsin that russia buy arms yet to be made in canada schreiber had been incarcerated in canada following his  arrest on a german warrant for tax evasion and is currently june  free on bail mulroney did not declare the income or pay taxes on it until years later when schreiber had come under criminal investigation in germany erik nielsen former deputy prime minister for mulroney stated disbelief in mulroneys account and denied his credibility i think there was a phrase that attached to brian years ago where he was known as lyin brian and for my own part i believe that theyre both in the same boat — schreiber and mulroney canadian prime minister stephen harper had called a public inquiry in november  and appointed future governor general david lloyd johnston as a special adviser to study the matter and prepare terms of reference for the inquiry johnston had once reported directly to mulroney during his term as prime minister johnston reported to harper on january   that he had found  significant questions which required further examination harper accepted the report and stated that a limited public inquiry process would begin once the house of commons ethics committee finished its work schreiber lost his fight against extradition to germany where he is at the center of a political bribery scandal that helped bring down a government and damaged the legacy of former chancellor helmut kohl he appeared before the house of commons ethics committee three times in late november and early december  and again in february  and will likely be called upon to testify at the future limited public inquiry mulroney appeared before the ethics committee on december   six weeks later his lawyers submitted a letter to paul szabo the ethics committee chairman indicating that their client would not appear again before the committee because of his unfair treatment on december  on february   two days before that scheduled appearance ctv news reported that mr mulroneys lawyer had reiterated mulroneys refusal to reappear before the committee after politics since leaving office mulroney has served as an international business consultant and remains a partner with the law firm ogilvy renault he currently sits on the board of directors of multiple corporations including barrick gold quebecor inc archer daniels midland trizechahn corp toronto cendant corp new york aol latin america inc new york and cognicase inc montreal he is a senior counselor to hicks muse tate  furst a global private equity fund in dallas chairman of forbes global new york and was a paid consultant and lobbyist for karlheinz schreiber beginning in  he is also chairman of various international advisory boards and councils for many international companies including power corp montreal bombardier montreal the china international trust and investment corp beijing jp morgan chase and co new york violy byorum and partners new york vsa communications partners new york independent newspapers dublin and general enterprise management services limited british virgin islands in  mulroney was accorded canadas highest civilian honour when he was made a companion of the order of canada at the funeral of ronald reagan with former soviet president mikhail gorbachev former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and former british prime minister margaret thatcher in  mulroney received the woodrow wilson award for public service from the woodrow wilson international center for scholars of the smithsonian institution at a ceremony in montreal the award was in recognition of his career in politics in january  mulroney delivered a keynote speech in washington dc celebrating the tenth anniversary of the north american free trade agreement in june  mulroney presented a eulogy for former us president ronald reagan during the latters state funeral mulroney and former british prime minister margaret thatcher were the first foreign dignitaries to eulogize at a funeral for an american president two years later at the request of prime minister stephen harper mulroney traveled to washington dc along with michael wilson canadas ambassador to the united states as canadas representatives at the state funeral of former president gerald ford in february  as part of a physical examination a ct scan revealed two small lumps in one of mulroneys lungs in his youth mulroney had been a heavy smoker his doctors performed a biopsy which ruled out cancer his surgery is sometimes cited as an example of the dangers of unnecessary testing he recovered well enough to tape a speech for the conservative party of canadas  policy convention in montreal in march though he could not attend in person he later developed pancreatitis and he remained in hospital for several weeks it was not until april  that his son ben mulroney announced he was recovering and would soon be releasedcitation needed on september   veteran writer and former mulroney confidant peter c newman released the secret mulroney tapes unguarded confessions of a prime minister based in large part on remarks from the former prime minister which newman had taped with mulroneys knowledge the book set off national controversy newman had been given unfettered access to mulroney for a thorough biography and claims mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers after the falling out mulroney began work on his autobiography without newmans help mulroney himself has declared that he showed poor judgement in making such unguarded statements but he says that he will have to live with it this led mulroney to respond at the annual press gallery dinner which is noted for comedic moments in ottawa october   the former prime minister appeared on tape and very formally acknowledged the various dignitaries and audience groups before delivering the shortest speech of the night peter newman go fuck yourself thank you ladies and gentlemen and good night thirteen years after leaving office mulroney was named the greenest prime minister in canadian history by a member panel at an event organized by corporate knights magazine in  mulroney became the chairman of quebecor and defused tensions resulting from the continuing influence of former president and ceo pierre karl péladeau current political affiliation mulroney joined the conservative party of canada following its creation in  by the merger of the progressive conservatives and the canadian alliance according to press reports his membership lapsed in  in early  mulroney called a highranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs although he denies this claim legacy mulroneys legacy is complicated and even emotional mulroney makes the case that his onceradical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments and regards this as vindication his deputy prime minister don mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as dragging canada kicking and screaming into the st century mulroneys legacy in canada is associated mostly with the  free trade agreement and the goods and services tax gst although the tories were reelected in  campaigning on free trade they won with only  of the popular vote compared to  of the vote which went to the liberals and the new democratic party who campaigned mostly against the agreement however when the liberals under jean chrétien came to office in  promising to renegotiate key parts of the agreement they continued the deal with only slight changes and signed the north american free trade agreement which expanded the free trade area to include mexico the visibility of the gst proved to be very unpopular the gst was created to help eliminate the evergrowing deficit and to replace the hidden manufacturers sales tax which mulroney argued was hurting business mulroneys usage of a rare constitutional clause to push the tax through prices not falling very much with the mst removed and the in your face nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public the succeeding liberal government of jean chrétien campaigned in  on a promise to eliminate the gst as per the red book but ultimately backed away from that promise this prompted two of their members sheila copps and john nunziata to resign or be expelled in protest mulroneys supporters argue that the gst helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable mulroneys intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years his government had flirted with  percent approval ratings in the early s when mulroneys honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media by canadians in general and by his political colleagues during the  election the progressive conservative party was reduced to just two seats which was seen as partially due to a backlash against mulroney as well as due to the fracturing of his grand coalition social conservatives found fault with mulroneys government in a variety of areas these include mulroneys opposition to capital punishment and an attempted compromise on abortion fiscal conservatives likewise didnt appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of big government programs and political patronage in the  election nearly all of the tories western support transferred into reform which replaced the pcs as the major rightwing force in canada the tories only won two seats west of quebec in the next decade and recovered only upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late s the canadian right was not reunited until they merged with reforms successor the canadian alliance in december  to form the new conservative party of canada mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger at a time when former pc leaders joe clark jean charest and kim campbell either opposed it or expressed ambivalence military historians norman hillmer and jl granatstein ranked mulroney eighth among canadas prime ministers in their  book prime ministers ranking canadas leaders on march   it was reported by various news outlets that a conservative official claimed mulroney was no longer a member of the party they claimed his membership expired in  and was not renewed additionally mulroney allegedly called a senior party official two months ago to ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease however a mulroney confidante speaking on condition of anonymity called the partys claims preposterous hes part of the history of this party you cant rewrite history if theyre worried about branding then shut the inquiry down theyre the ones who called the inquiry  memoir mulroney appears during an interview speaking about his memoirs mulroneys memoirs  was released on september   mulroney criticizes trudeau for avoiding military service in world war ii and favourably references sources that describe the young trudeau as holding antisemitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators tom axworthy a prominent liberal strategist responded that trudeau should be judged on his mature views historian and former mp and trudeau biographer john english said i dont think it does any good to do this kind of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations an earlier book expressing brian mulroneys own opinions and

scotia a campaign that led to the thenlargest majority in canadian history after graduating from st francis xavier with a degree in political science in  mulroney at first pursued a law degree from

an advance man mulroney significantly assisted with stanfields successful  reelection campaign mulroney neglected his studies then fell seriously ill during the winter term was hospitalized and despite getting extensions for several courses because of his illness flunked out of dalhousie his first year he then applied to université laval in quebec city and restarted firstyear law there the

mulroney built a network of friends including lucien bouchard bernard roy michel cogger michael meighen and jean bazin that would play a prominent role in canadian politics for years to come during this time mulroney was still involved in the conservative youth wing and was acquainted with the president of the student federation joe clarkcitation needed mulroney secured a plum temporary appointment in ottawa during the summer of  as the executive assistant to alvin hamilton minister of agriculture then a federal election was called and prime minister diefenbaker appointed hamilton as the acting prime minister for the rest of the campaign hamilton took mulroney with him on the campaign trail where the young organizer gained valuable experience builds reputation gains publicity after graduating from laval in  mulroney joined the montreal law firm now known as norton rose fulbright which at the time was the largest law firm in the commonwealth of nations mulroney twice failed his bar exams but the firm kept him due to his charming personality after ultimately passing his bar exams mulroney was admitted to the quebec bar in  and became a labour lawyer which was then a new and exciting field of law in quebec mulroneys superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation with opponents often polarized and at odds proved ideal for this field he was noted for ending several strikes along the montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer w david angus of stikeman elliott who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaignscitation needed in  dalton camp who by then was president of the progressive conservative party ran for reelection in what many believed to be a referendum on diefenbakers leadership diefenbaker had reached his th birthday in

victory diefenbaker called for a  leadership convention in toronto mulroney joined with joe clark and others in supporting former justice minister e davie fulton once fulton dropped off the ballot mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to robert stanfield who won mulroney then  would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in quebeccitation needed mulroneys professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the montreal newspaper la presse in doing so mulroney and the papers owner canadian business mogul paul desmarais became friends after his initial difficulties mulroneys reputation in his firm steadily increased and he was made a partner in  mulroneys big break came during the cliche commission in  which was set up by quebec premier robert bourassa to investigate the situation at james bay canadas largest hydroelectric project violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle to ensure the commission was nonpartisan bourassa the liberal premier placed robert cliche a former leader of the provincial new democratic party in charge cliche asked mulroney a progressive conservative and a former student of his to join the commission mulroney asked lucien bouchard to join as counsel the committees proceedings which showed mafia infiltration of the unions made mulroney well known in quebec as the hearings were extensively covered in the media the cliche commissions report was largely adopted by the bourassa government a notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the premier of quebec although bouchard favoured calling in robert bourassa as a witness mulroney refused deeming it a violation of executive privilege mulroney and bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when mulroney ran for reelection in  loses first leadership race – the stanfieldled progressive conservatives lost the  election to the pierre trudeauled liberals leading to stanfields resignation as leader mulroney despite never having run for elected office entered the contest to replace him mulroney and provincial rival claude wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the partys standing in quebec which had supported the federal liberals for decades mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting wagner to the pc party a few years earlier and the two wound up as rivals for quebec delegates most of whom were snared by wagner who even blocked mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention in the leadership race mulroney spent an estimated  far more than the other candidates and earned himself the nickname cadillac candidate at the  leadership convention mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind wagner however his expensive campaign slick image lack of parliamentary experience and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates and he was unable to build upon his base support being overtaken by eventual winner joe clark on the second ballot mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses and his campaign finished deeply in debt following the convention mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in clarks caucus business leadership mulroney took the job of executive vice president of the iron ore company of canada a joint subsidiary of three major us steel corporations mulroney earned a salary well into the sixfigure range in  he was appointed company president drawing upon his labour law experience he instituted improved labour relations and with commodity prices on the rise company profits soared during the next several years in  mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the schefferville mine winning a generous settlement for the affected workers under his leadership the company was sold off to foreign interests in the wake of his loss in the  leadership race mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years he credits his loyal wife mila with helping him recover in  he permanently became a teetotaler during his ioc term he made liberal use of the companys executive jet frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country as his business reputation grew he was invited onto several corporate boards he declined an offer to run in a quebec byelection as a federal liberal party leader joe clark led the progressive conservative party to a minority government in the  federal election which ended  years of continuous liberal rule however the government fell after a successful noconfidence motion over his minority governments budget in december  the pcs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to trudeau and the liberals many tories were also annoyed with clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in june  by late  joe clarks leadership of the progressive conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many tory members of parliament despite his solid national lead over prime minister pierre trudeau in opinion polls which stretched to  percent in summer  mulroney on the floor of the  leadership convention photograph by alasdair roberts mulroney while publicly endorsing clark at a press conference in  organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the partys leadership review clarks key quebec organizer rodrigue pageau was in fact a double agent working for mulroney undermining clarks support when clark received an endorsement by only  per cent of delegates at the party convention in january  in winnipeg he resigned and ran to regain his post at the  leadership convention despite still not being a member of parliament mulroney ran against him campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before mulroney had been criticized in  for lacking policy depth and substance a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early s which were collected into a book where i stand published in  mulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign for which he had been criticized mulroney was elected party leader on june   beating clark on the fourth ballot attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native quebec two months later mulroney entered parliament as the mp for central nova in nova scotia winning a byelection in what was then considered a safe tory seat after elmer mackay stood aside in his favour this is a common practice in most parliamentary systems throughout his political career mulroneys fluency in english and french with quebec roots in both cultures gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive because of health problems shortly after becoming party leader mulroney quit smoking in  by the start of  as mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the house of commons the tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling it was almost taken for granted that trudeau would be heavily defeated by mulroney in the general election due no later than  trudeau announced his retirement in february and the liberal party chose john turner previously the minister of finance under trudeau in the s as its new leader the liberals then surged in the polls to take a lead after trailing by more than  percentage points only four days after being sworn in as prime minister turner called a general election for september in so doing he had to postpone a planned canadian summer visit by queen elizabeth ii who makes it her policy to not travel abroad during foreign election campaigns but the liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray leading to a weak campaign the campaign is best remembered for mulroneys attacks on a raft of liberal patronage appointments in his final days in office trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of senators judges and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards widely seen as a way to offer plum jobs to loyal members of the liberal party upon assuming office turner who had been out of politics for nine years while he earned a lucrative salary as a toronto lawyer showed that his political instincts had diminished he had been under pressure to advise sauvé to cancel the appointments—which convention would have required sauvé to do however turner chose not to do so and instead proceeded to appoint several more liberals to prominent political offices per a signed legal agreement with trudeau ironically turner had planned to attack mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory in a televised leaders debate turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old union nationale in quebec however mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of liberal patronage appointments he demanded that turner apologize to the country for making these horrible appointments turner replied that i had no option except to let the appointments stand mulroney famously responded you had an option sir you could have said i am not going to do it this is wrong for canada and i am not going to ask canadians to pay the price you had an option sir—to say no—and you chose to say yes to the old attitudes and the old stories of the liberal party that sir if i may say respectfully is not good enough for canadians turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from mulroney he could repeat only i had no option a visibly angry mulroney called this an avowal of failure and a confession of nonleadership the exchange led most papers the next day with most of them paraphrasing mulroneys counterattack as you had an option sir—you could have said no many observers believe that at this point mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister on september  mulroney and the tories won the largest majority government in canadian history they took  seats three more than their previous record in  the liberals won only  seats which at the time was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in canadian history the conservatives won just over half of the popular vote compared to  percent in  and led in every province emerging as a national party for the first time since  especially important was the tories performance in mulroneys home province quebec the tories had only won the most seats in that province once since  – the  tory landslide however largely due to anger at trudeau and mulroneys promise of a new deal for quebec the province swung over dramatically to support him the tories had only won one seat out of  in  but took  seats in  mulroney yielded central nova back to mackay and instead ran in the eastern quebec riding of manicouagan which included baiecomeau in  the canadian press named mulroney newsmaker of the year for the second straight year making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister the other being lester pearson prime minister – first mandate – mila left and brian right mulroney greet rt hon pierre trudeau foreground the first conservative majority government in  years—and only the second in  years—initially seemed to give mulroney a very formidable position the tories had won just over half the popular vote and no other party crossed the seat mark on paper he was free to take canada in any direction he wanted however his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest his support was based on a grand coalition of socially conservative populists from the west quebec nationalists and fiscal conservatives from ontario and atlantic canada such diverse interests became difficult for mulroney to juggle he attempted to appeal to the western provinces whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success by cancelling the national energy program and including a large number of westerners in his cabinet including clark as minister of external affairs however he was not completely successful even aside from economic and constitutional policy for example he moved cf servicing from manitoba to quebec in  even though the manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated and received death threats for exerting pressure on manitoba over french language rights many of mulroneys ministers had little government experience resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals many tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government indeed mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage including the reference to ambassador bryce mackasey as theres no whore like an old whore the new prime ministers handlers were concerned by apparent unpredictability and rumours of drinking mila left and brian right mulroney at andrews air force base in september  one of mulroneys main priorities was to lower the deficit which had increased from  billion under lester b pearson to  billion under pierre eliott trudeau however the countrys debt increased during mulroneys term from  billion to  billion his attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises also impeding his progress was the senate where the liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power led by allan maceachen the senate took a very assertive role in legislation forcing the government to compromise on several points despite its considerable house majority a major undertaking by mulroneys government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity quebec was the only province that did not sign the new canadian constitution negotiated by prime minister pierre trudeau in  and mulroney wanted to include quebec in a new agreement with the rest of canada in  he negotiated the meech lake accord with the provincial premiers a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy quebecs demand for recognition as a distinct society within canada and to devolve some powers to the provinces the mulroneys with president and mrs reagan in quebec canada march   the day after the famous shamrock summit when the two leaders sang when irish eyes are smiling another of mulroneys priorities was the privatization of many of canadas crown corporations in  the government of canada held  different crown corporations it sold off  of them including air canada which was completely privatized by  although the air canada public participation act continued to make certain requirements of the airline petrocanada was also later privatized the air india flight  bombing which originated in montreal happened during mulroneys first term this was the largest terrorist act before september   with the majority of the  victims being canadian citizens mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then indian prime minister rajiv gandhi which sparked an uproar in canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to mulroney given that the majority of victims were canadian or lived in canada many indocanadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt mulroney did not consider them to be true canadian citizens as they were not of european descentcitation needed furthermore there were several warnings from the indian government to the mulroney government about terrorist threats towards air india flights questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented the governor generalincouncil in  appointed the former supreme court justice john major to conduct a commission of inquiry his report was completed and released on  june  near the end of his first term mulroney gave a formal apology and a  million compensation package to the families of the  japanese canadians who had been divested of their property and interned during world war ii foreign policy mulroneys government opposed the apartheid regime in south africa and he met with many of the regimes opposition leaders throughout his tenure his position put him at odds with the american and british governments but also won him respect elsewhere also external affairs minister joe clark was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated ethiopia to lead the western response to the – famine in that country clark landed in addis ababa so quickly he had not even seen the cbc report that had created the initial and strong public reaction canadas response was overwhelming and led the usa and britain to follow suit almost immediately — an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time since ethiopia had a marxist regime and had previously been isolated by western governments the mulroney government also took a strong stand against the us intervention in nicaragua under reagan and accepted refugees from el salvador guatemala and other countries with repressive regimes supported directly by the reagan administration free trade during his tenure as prime minister brian mulroneys close relationship with us president ronald reagan helped secure a landmark treaty on acid rain and the ratification of a freetrade treaty with the united states under which all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by  critics noted that mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the  leadership campaign this agreement was controversial and the senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote the canadaus free trade agreement was the central issue of the  election with the liberals and ndp opposing it with the liberals gaining the initial momentum a successful counterattack by allan gregg resulted in the pcs being reelected with a solid but reduced majority and  percent of the popular vote mulroney thus became the only conservative in the th century to lead his party to consecutive majority governments during peacetime in this election mulroney transferred to another eastern quebec seat charlevoix after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include baiecomeau on election day november   mulroney made a controversial order in council which allowed the establishment of the amex bank of canada owned by american express second mandate – mulroneys second term was marked by an economic recession he proposed the introduction of a national sales tax the goods and services tax gst in  when it was introduced in  it replaced the manufacturers sales tax mst that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in canada a bitter senate battle ensued and many polls showed that as many as  of canadians were opposed to the tax mulroney had to use section  the deadlock clause a little known constitutional provision allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the queen to appoint  new senators although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase but a tax shift the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular and many resented mulroneys use of an emergency clause in the constitution the meech lake accord also met its doom in  it was not ratified by the provincial governments of manitoba and newfoundland before the june ratification deadline this failure sparked a revival of quebec separatism and led to another round of meetings in charlottetown in  and  these negotiations culminated in the charlottetown accord which outlined extensive changes to the constitution including recognition of quebec as a distinct society however the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in october  many blamed the gst battle and mulroneys unpopularity for the fall of the accord in  mulroney nominated ray hnatyshyn an mp from saskatoon and a former cabinet minister to be governor general – on december   canada became the first western nation to recognize ukraine as an independent country next day after the landslide referendum in favor of independence in ukraine nafta initialing ceremony october  from left to right standing mexican president salinas us president bush prime minister mulroney seated jaime serra puche carla hills michael wilson the worldwide recession of the early s significantly damaged the governments financial situation mulroneys inability to improve the governments finances as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his probusiness plan which had increased the deficit at the same time the bank of canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in canada annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels reaching  billion in his last year of office these deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of  of gdp further weakening the canadian dollar and damaging canadas international credit rating mulroney supported the united nations coalition during the  gulf war and when the un authorized full use of force in the operation canada sent a cf squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of the royal canadian regiment to safeguard these ground elements calling canadas participation operation friction in august he sent the destroyers hmcs terra nova and hmcs athabaskan to enforce the trade blockade against iraq the supply ship hmcs protecteur was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces when the air war began canadas planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets this was the first time since the fighting on cyprus in  that canadian forces participated directly in combat operations for the canadian forces the mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment most members of the cf welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services replacing the single green uniform worn since unification – a white paper proposed boosting the cfs combat capability which had according to canadian defence quarterly declined so badly that canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the gulf war had it desired to the cf in this period did undergo a muchneeded modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms many proposed reforms however failed to occur and according to historian jl granatstein mulroney raised the militarys hopes repeatedly but failed to deliver in  he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to  troops but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below  by  this was however in step with other nato countries after the end of the cold war the mulroney government undertook a defence policy review publishing a new statement in late  but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the post cold war era was arrived at before the governments defeat in  according to granatstein this meant that canada was not able to live up to its postcold war military commitments the decline of cod stocks in atlantic canada led the mulroney government to impose a moratorium on the cod fishery there putting an end to a large portion of the newfoundland fishing industry and causing serious economic hardship the government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the atlantic provinces the environment was a key focus of mulroneys government as canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the un conference on the environment his government added significant new national parks bruce peninsula south moresby and grasslands and passed the canadian environmental assessment act and canadian environmental protection act retirement widespread public resentment of the goods and services tax an economic slump the fracturing of his political coalition and his lack of results regarding the quebec situation caused mulroneys popularity to decline considerably during his second term an ominous sign was a  byelection in the alberta riding of beaver river in this election called when tory mp john dahmer died before ever having a chance to attend a sitting reform party candidate deborah grey won by a hefty  votes after finishing fourth in the general election just five months earlier this was perhaps the first sign that mulroneys grand coalition was fracturing the pcs had dominated albertas federal politics since the  election another sign came before meech lake was finalized when bouchard resigned from both the cabinet and the party over changes to the proposal that he felt diluted its spirit after the failure of meech bouchard convinced several other tories to break with the party and join him to form the bloc québécois a prosovereigntist ie independentist party years later mulroney said that his biggest error as prime minister had been trusting his former university friend indeed he and bouchard have not spoken to each other in over two decades mulroney entered  facing a statutory general election under canadian law federal governments can have a maximum duration of five years but they often have lesser duration as they must enjoy the confidence of the house of commons in order to continue in office by this time his approval ratings had dipped into the teens and were at  in a  gallup poll making him one of the most unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in canada in the s there was a consensus that mulroney would be heavily defeated by jean chrétien and the liberals if he led the tories into the next election—ironically the same situation that led to trudeaus departure from the scene nine years earlier he announced his retirement from politics in february and was replaced as prime minister by defence minister kim campbell in june the last gallup poll taken before his retirement in february  showed his approval ratings had rebounded to  in his final days in office mulroney made several decisions that hampered the tory campaign later that year he took a lavish international farewell tour mostly at taxpayers expense without transacting any official business also by the time he handed power to campbell there were only twoandahalf months left in the tories fiveyear mandate further compounding the problem mulroney continued to live at  sussex drive for some time after campbell was sworn in as prime minister brian and mila mulroneys new private residence in montreal was undergoing renovations and they did not move out of  sussex until their new home was ready instead campbell took up residence at harrington lake the prime ministers official summer retreat across the river in gatineau park quebec the  election was a disaster for the tories the oldest party in canada was reduced from a majority with  seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level the seat loss far exceeded the seat loss the liberals suffered in  the tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the house of commons since the required minimum number of seats for official party status is  as an example of the antipathy toward mulroney his former riding fell to the bloc by a lopsided margin the tory candidate finished a distant third with only  votes—just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit in her memoirs time and chance and in her response in the national post to the secret mulroney tapes campbell said that mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the tories reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off campbell went as far as to claim that mulroney knew the tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election and wanted a scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity rather than a true successor airbusschreiber affair main article airbus affair in  mulroney settled a libel lawsuit he had brought against the government of canada two years previously mulroney received an apology and a  million reimbursement for legal and public relations costs at issue were allegations that mulroney had accepted bribes in the airbus affair concerning government contracts the government said the charges could not be substantiated the principal royal canadian mounted police rcmp investigator on the case retired a year later the government later dropped the investigation entirely but a key fact was unknown in  and had not been elicited under sworn testimony in which mulroney had denied business dealings or significant meetings with a business associate mulroney later confirmed that he had personally accepted cash payments from his business associate karlheinz schreiber a germancanadian businessman who had been a paid broker for airbus and other companies the cash changed hands in three secret meetings in hotels in montreal and new york city in brown paper bags of  bills totaling either  according to mulroney or  according to schrieber the payments occurred over an month period beginning in  when mulroney had stepped down as prime minister but was still a member of parliament in  mulroney stated that he had kept the cash paid in new york in a new york safe deposit box thus implying that he had not illegally carried it undeclared across the uscanada border and in a safe in his montreal home the cash payments had not then been declared as income for tax purposes schreiber had at his disposal  million from airbus for the payment of secret commissions cbc television reported on february   that the money schreiber paid to mulroney originated in a swiss bank account codenamed frankfurt schreiber used the same account to pay the secret airbus commissions schreiber transferred  from frankfurt to an account in zürich codenamed britan on july   and used these funds to make the three cash payments to mulroney in  and  five years after the payments began mulroney and schreiber met again in a suite at the hotel savoy in zurich switzerland schreiber claims mulroney tried to extract a promise schreiber would never reveal the payments schreiber also claims mulroneys attorneys later tried to induce him into perjury by asking that he sign an affidavit falsely stating that he had never paid any money to mulroney mulroney denies this and also denies schreibers claim that the payments totaled  testifying before the house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney said the cash payments were for lobbying foreign leaders to buy armored vehicles from thyssen industries a company schreiber represented mulroney said schreiber had paid him as a consultant for this task only in the context of the potential bear head project which had actually been canceled three years prior to his accepting payment mulroney said he never had a written contract made written reports or issued receipts for the cash payments mulroney said he had destroyed records related to the transactions and received the payments in cash mulroney denied any illegal wrongdoing he admitted to errors in judgment and apologized for the impropriety mulroney described the public revelation of his wrongdoing as a near death experience and said his family had suffered greatly for many years mulroney had not acknowledged receiving money from schreiber the payments were concealed in mulroneys  lawsuit against the government of canada mulroney falsely testified under oath that he never had any dealings with schreiber knew him only peripherally and they had a cup of coffee once or twice in his  book a secret trial former law professor william kaplan describes mulroneys testimony as evasive incomplete and misleading in his testimony schreiber made allegations that described a canadian party leader subverted and deposed by foreign interests of federal contracts being used to funnel money back to those interests of bidrigging and kickbacks mulroney and schreiber question each others truthfulness and credibility in his testimony to the canadian house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney pointed out contradictory statements schreiber has made over the years including statements made under oath mulroney also stated that the work he had performed for his armstrading business associate schreiber was outofcountry rather than lobbying his own canadian government – such as lobbying the late president boris yeltsin that russia buy arms yet to be made in canada schreiber had been incarcerated in canada following his  arrest on a german warrant for tax evasion and is currently june  free on bail mulroney did not declare the income or pay taxes on it until years later when schreiber had come under criminal investigation in germany erik nielsen former deputy prime minister for mulroney stated disbelief in mulroneys account and denied his credibility i think there was a phrase that attached to brian years ago where he was known as lyin brian and for my own part i believe that theyre both in the same boat — schreiber and mulroney canadian prime minister stephen harper had called a public inquiry in november  and appointed future governor general david lloyd johnston as a special adviser to study the matter and prepare terms of reference for the inquiry johnston had once reported directly to mulroney during his term as prime minister johnston reported to harper on january   that he had found  significant questions which required further examination harper accepted the report and stated that a limited public inquiry process would begin once the house of commons ethics committee finished its work schreiber lost his fight against extradition to germany where he is at the center of a political bribery scandal that helped bring down a government and damaged the legacy of former chancellor helmut kohl he appeared before the house of commons ethics committee three times in late november and early december  and again in february  and will likely be called upon to testify at the future limited public inquiry mulroney appeared before the ethics committee on december   six weeks later his lawyers submitted a letter to paul szabo the ethics committee chairman indicating that their client would not appear again before the committee because of his unfair treatment on december  on february   two days before that scheduled appearance ctv news reported that mr mulroneys lawyer had reiterated mulroneys refusal to reappear before the committee after politics since leaving office mulroney has served as an international business consultant and remains a partner with the law firm ogilvy renault he currently sits on the board of directors of multiple corporations including barrick gold quebecor inc archer daniels midland trizechahn corp toronto cendant corp new york aol latin america inc new york and cognicase inc montreal he is a senior counselor to hicks muse tate  furst a global private equity fund in dallas chairman of forbes global new york and was a paid consultant and lobbyist for karlheinz schreiber beginning in  he is also chairman of various international advisory boards and councils for many international companies including power corp montreal bombardier montreal the china international trust and investment corp beijing jp morgan chase and co new york violy byorum and partners new york vsa communications partners new york independent newspapers dublin and general enterprise management services limited british virgin islands in  mulroney was accorded canadas highest civilian honour when he was made a companion of the order of canada at the funeral of ronald reagan with former soviet president mikhail gorbachev former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and former british prime minister margaret thatcher in  mulroney received the woodrow wilson award for public service from the woodrow wilson international center for scholars of the smithsonian institution at a ceremony in montreal the award was in recognition of his career in politics in january  mulroney delivered a keynote speech in washington dc celebrating the tenth anniversary of the north american free trade agreement in june  mulroney presented a eulogy for former us president ronald reagan during the latters state funeral mulroney and former british prime minister margaret thatcher were the first foreign dignitaries to eulogize at a funeral for an american president two years later at the request of prime minister stephen harper mulroney traveled to washington dc along with michael wilson canadas ambassador to the united states as canadas representatives at the state funeral of former president gerald ford in february  as part of a physical examination a ct scan revealed two small lumps in one of mulroneys lungs in his youth mulroney had been a heavy smoker his doctors performed a biopsy which ruled out cancer his surgery is sometimes cited as an example of the dangers of unnecessary testing he recovered well enough to tape a speech for the conservative party of canadas  policy convention in montreal in march though he could not attend in person he later developed pancreatitis and he remained in hospital for several weeks it was not until april  that his son ben mulroney announced he was recovering and would soon be releasedcitation needed on september   veteran writer and former mulroney confidant peter c newman released the secret mulroney tapes unguarded confessions of a prime minister based in large part on remarks from the former prime minister which newman had taped with mulroneys knowledge the book set off national controversy newman had been given unfettered access to mulroney for a thorough biography and claims mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers after the falling out mulroney began work on his autobiography without newmans help mulroney himself has declared that he showed poor judgement in making such unguarded statements but he says that he will have to live with it this led mulroney to respond at the annual press gallery dinner which is noted for comedic moments in ottawa october   the former prime minister appeared on tape and very formally acknowledged the various dignitaries and audience groups before delivering the shortest speech of the night peter newman go fuck yourself thank you ladies and gentlemen and good night thirteen years after leaving office mulroney was named the greenest prime minister in canadian history by a member panel at an event organized by corporate knights magazine in  mulroney became the chairman of quebecor and defused tensions resulting from the continuing influence of former president and ceo pierre karl péladeau current political affiliation mulroney joined the conservative party of canada following its creation in  by the merger of the progressive conservatives and the canadian alliance according to press reports his membership lapsed in  in early  mulroney called a highranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs although he denies this claim legacy mulroneys legacy is complicated and even emotional mulroney makes the case that his onceradical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments and regards this as vindication his deputy prime minister don mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as dragging canada kicking and screaming into the st century mulroneys legacy in canada is associated mostly with the  free trade agreement and the goods and services tax gst although the tories were reelected in  campaigning on free trade they won with only  of the popular vote compared to  of the vote which went to the liberals and the new democratic party who campaigned mostly against the agreement however when the liberals under jean chrétien came to office in  promising to renegotiate key parts of the agreement they continued the deal with only slight changes and signed the north american free trade agreement which expanded the free trade area to include mexico the visibility of the gst proved to be very unpopular the gst was created to help eliminate the evergrowing deficit and to replace the hidden manufacturers sales tax which mulroney argued was hurting business mulroneys usage of a rare constitutional clause to push the tax through prices not falling very much with the mst removed and the in your face nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public the succeeding liberal government of jean chrétien campaigned in  on a promise to eliminate the gst as per the red book but ultimately backed away from that promise this prompted two of their members sheila copps and john nunziata to resign or be expelled in protest mulroneys supporters argue that the gst helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable mulroneys intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years his government had flirted with  percent approval ratings in the early s when mulroneys honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media by canadians in general and by his political colleagues during the  election the progressive conservative party was reduced to just two seats which was seen as partially due to a backlash against mulroney as well as due to the fracturing of his grand coalition social conservatives found fault with mulroneys government in a variety of areas these include mulroneys opposition to capital punishment and an attempted compromise on abortion fiscal conservatives likewise didnt appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of big government programs and political patronage in the  election nearly all of the tories western support transferred into reform which replaced the pcs as the major rightwing force in canada the tories only won two seats west of quebec in the next decade and recovered only upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late s the canadian right was not reunited until they merged with reforms successor the canadian alliance in december  to form the new conservative party of canada mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger at a time when former pc leaders joe clark jean charest and kim campbell either opposed it or expressed ambivalence military historians norman hillmer and jl granatstein ranked mulroney eighth among canadas prime ministers in their  book prime ministers ranking canadas leaders on march   it was reported by various news outlets that a conservative official claimed mulroney was no longer a member of the party they claimed his membership expired in  and was not renewed additionally mulroney allegedly called a senior party official two months ago to ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease however a mulroney confidante speaking on condition of anonymity called the partys claims preposterous hes part of the history of this party you cant rewrite history if theyre worried about branding then shut the inquiry down theyre the ones who called the inquiry  memoir mulroney appears during an interview speaking about his memoirs mulroneys memoirs  was released on september   mulroney criticizes trudeau for avoiding military service in world war ii and favourably references sources that describe the young trudeau as holding antisemitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators tom axworthy a prominent liberal strategist responded that trudeau should be judged on his mature views historian and former mp and trudeau biographer john english said i dont think it does any good to do this kind of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations an earlier book expressing brian mulroneys own opinions and

scotia a campaign that led to the thenlargest majority in canadian history after graduating from st francis xavier with a degree in political science in  mulroney at first pursued a law degree from

mulroney built a network of friends including lucien bouchard bernard roy michel cogger michael meighen and jean bazin that would play a prominent role in canadian politics for years to come during this time mulroney was still involved in the conservative youth wing and was acquainted with the president of the student federation joe clarkcitation needed mulroney secured a plum temporary appointment in ottawa during the summer of  as the executive assistant to alvin hamilton minister of agriculture then a federal election was called and prime minister diefenbaker appointed hamilton as the acting prime minister for the rest of the campaign hamilton took mulroney with him on the campaign trail where the young organizer gained valuable experience builds reputation gains publicity after graduating from laval in  mulroney joined the montreal law firm now known as norton rose fulbright which at the time was the largest law firm in the commonwealth of nations mulroney twice failed his bar exams but the firm kept him due to his charming personality after ultimately passing his bar exams mulroney was admitted to the quebec bar in  and became a labour lawyer which was then a new and exciting field of law in quebec mulroneys superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation with opponents often polarized and at odds proved ideal for this field he was noted for ending

victory diefenbaker called for a  leadership convention in toronto mulroney joined with joe clark and others in supporting former justice minister e davie fulton once fulton dropped off the ballot mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to robert stanfield who won mulroney then  would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in quebeccitation needed mulroneys professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the montreal newspaper la presse in doing so mulroney and the papers owner canadian business mogul paul desmarais became friends after his initial difficulties mulroneys reputation in his firm steadily increased and he was made a partner in  mulroneys big break came during the cliche commission in  which was set up by quebec premier robert bourassa to investigate the situation at james bay canadas largest hydroelectric project violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle to ensure the commission was nonpartisan bourassa the liberal premier placed robert cliche a former leader of the provincial new democratic party in charge cliche asked mulroney a progressive conservative and a former student of his to join the commission mulroney asked lucien bouchard to join as counsel the committees proceedings which showed mafia infiltration of the unions made mulroney well known in quebec as the hearings were extensively covered in the media the cliche commissions report was largely adopted by the bourassa government a notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the premier of quebec although bouchard favoured calling in robert bourassa as a witness mulroney refused deeming it a violation of executive privilege mulroney and bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when mulroney ran for reelection in  loses first leadership race – the stanfieldled progressive conservatives lost the  election to the pierre trudeauled liberals leading to stanfields resignation as leader mulroney despite never having run for elected office entered the contest to replace him mulroney and provincial rival claude wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the partys standing in quebec which had supported the federal liberals for decades mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting wagner to the pc party a few years earlier and the two wound up as rivals for quebec delegates most of whom were snared by wagner who even blocked mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention in the leadership race mulroney spent an estimated  far more than the other candidates and earned himself the nickname cadillac candidate at the  leadership convention mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind wagner however his expensive campaign slick image lack of parliamentary experience and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates and he was unable to build upon his base support being overtaken by eventual winner joe clark on the second ballot mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses and his campaign finished deeply in debt following the convention mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in clarks caucus business leadership mulroney took the job of executive vice president of the iron ore company of canada a joint subsidiary of three major us steel corporations mulroney earned a salary well into the sixfigure range in  he was appointed company president drawing upon his labour law experience he instituted improved labour relations and with commodity prices on the rise company profits soared during the next several years in  mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the schefferville mine winning a generous settlement for the affected workers under his leadership the company was sold off to foreign interests in the wake of his loss in the  leadership race mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years he credits his loyal wife mila with helping him recover in  he permanently became a teetotaler during his ioc term he made liberal use of the companys executive jet frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country as his business reputation grew he was invited onto several corporate boards he declined an offer to run in a quebec byelection as a federal liberal party leader joe clark led the progressive conservative party to a minority government in the  federal election which ended  years of continuous liberal rule however the government fell after a successful noconfidence motion over his minority governments budget in december  the pcs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to trudeau and the liberals many tories were also annoyed with clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in june  by late  joe clarks leadership of the progressive conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many tory members of parliament despite his solid national lead over prime minister pierre trudeau in opinion polls which stretched to  percent in summer  mulroney on the floor of the  leadership convention photograph by alasdair roberts mulroney while publicly endorsing clark at a press conference in  organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the partys leadership review clarks key quebec organizer rodrigue pageau was in fact a double agent working for mulroney undermining clarks support when clark received an endorsement by only  per cent of delegates at the party convention in january  in winnipeg he resigned and ran to regain his post at the  leadership convention despite still not being a member of parliament mulroney ran against him campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before mulroney had been criticized in  for lacking policy depth and substance a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early s which were collected into a book where i stand published in  mulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign for which he had been criticized mulroney was elected party leader on june   beating clark on the fourth ballot attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native quebec two months later mulroney entered parliament as the mp for central nova in nova scotia winning a byelection in what was then considered a safe tory seat after elmer mackay stood aside in his favour this is a common practice in most parliamentary systems throughout his political career mulroneys fluency in english and french with quebec roots in both cultures gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive because of health problems shortly after becoming party leader mulroney quit smoking in  by the start of  as mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the house of commons the tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling it was almost taken for granted that trudeau would be heavily defeated by mulroney in the general election due no later than  trudeau announced his retirement in february and the liberal party chose john turner previously the minister of finance under trudeau in the s as its new leader the liberals then surged in the polls to take a lead after trailing by more than  percentage points only four days after being sworn in as prime minister turner called a general election for september in so doing he had to postpone a planned canadian summer visit by queen elizabeth ii who makes it her policy to not travel abroad during foreign election campaigns but the liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray leading to a weak campaign the campaign is best remembered for mulroneys attacks on a raft of liberal patronage appointments in his final days in office trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of senators judges and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards widely seen as a way to offer plum jobs to loyal members of the liberal party upon assuming office turner who had been out of politics for nine years while he earned a lucrative salary as a toronto lawyer showed that his political instincts had diminished he had been under pressure to advise sauvé to cancel the appointments—which convention would have required sauvé to do however turner chose not to do so and instead proceeded to appoint several more liberals to prominent political offices per a signed legal agreement with trudeau ironically turner had planned to attack mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory in a televised leaders debate turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old union nationale in quebec however mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of liberal patronage appointments he demanded that turner apologize to the country for making these horrible appointments turner replied that i had no option except to let the appointments stand mulroney famously responded you had an option sir you could have said i am not going to do it this is wrong for canada and i am not going to ask canadians to pay the price you had an option sir—to say no—and you chose to say yes to the old attitudes and the old stories of the liberal party that sir if i may say respectfully is not good enough for canadians turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from mulroney he could repeat only i had no option a visibly angry mulroney called this an avowal of failure and a confession of nonleadership the exchange led most papers the next day with most of them paraphrasing mulroneys counterattack as you had an option sir—you could have said no many observers believe that at this point mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister on september  mulroney and the tories won the largest majority government in canadian history they took  seats three more than their previous record in  the liberals won only  seats which at the time was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in canadian history the conservatives won just over half of the popular vote compared to  percent in  and led in every province emerging as a national party for the first time since  especially important was the tories performance in mulroneys home province quebec the tories had only won the most seats in that province once since  – the  tory landslide however largely due to anger at trudeau and mulroneys promise of a new deal for quebec the province swung over dramatically to support him the tories had only won one seat out of  in  but took  seats in  mulroney yielded central nova back to mackay and instead ran in the eastern quebec riding of manicouagan which included baiecomeau in  the canadian press named mulroney newsmaker of the year for the second straight year making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister the other being lester pearson prime minister – first mandate – mila left and brian right mulroney greet rt hon pierre trudeau foreground the first conservative majority government in  years—and only the second in  years—initially seemed to give mulroney a very formidable position the tories had won just over half the popular vote and no other party crossed the seat mark on paper he was free to take canada in any direction he wanted however his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest his support was based on a grand coalition of socially conservative populists from the west quebec nationalists and fiscal conservatives from ontario and atlantic canada such diverse interests became difficult for mulroney to juggle he attempted to appeal to the western provinces whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success by cancelling the national energy program and including a large number of westerners in his cabinet including clark as minister of external affairs however he was not completely successful even aside from economic and constitutional policy for example he moved cf servicing from manitoba to quebec in  even though the manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated and received death threats for exerting pressure on manitoba over french language rights many of mulroneys ministers had little government experience resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals many tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government indeed mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage including the reference to ambassador bryce mackasey as theres no whore like an old whore the new prime ministers handlers were concerned by apparent unpredictability and rumours of drinking mila left and brian right mulroney at andrews air force base in september  one of mulroneys main priorities was to lower the deficit which had increased from  billion under lester b pearson to  billion under pierre eliott trudeau however the countrys debt increased during mulroneys term from  billion to  billion his attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises also impeding his progress was the senate where the liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power led by allan maceachen the senate took a very assertive role in legislation forcing the government to compromise on several points despite its considerable house majority a major undertaking by mulroneys government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity quebec was the only province that did not sign the new canadian constitution negotiated by prime minister pierre trudeau in  and mulroney wanted to include quebec in a new agreement with the rest of canada in  he negotiated the meech lake accord with the provincial premiers a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy quebecs demand for recognition as a distinct society within canada and to devolve some powers to the provinces the mulroneys with president and mrs reagan in quebec canada march   the day after the famous shamrock summit when the two leaders sang when irish eyes are smiling another of mulroneys priorities was the privatization of many of canadas crown corporations in  the government of canada held  different crown corporations it sold off  of them including air canada which was completely privatized by  although the air canada public participation act continued to make certain requirements of the airline petrocanada was also later privatized the air india flight  bombing which originated in montreal happened during mulroneys first term this was the largest terrorist act before september   with the majority of the  victims being canadian citizens mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then indian prime minister rajiv gandhi which sparked an uproar in canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to mulroney given that the majority of victims were canadian or lived in canada many indocanadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt mulroney did not consider them to be true canadian citizens as they were not of european descentcitation needed furthermore there were several warnings from the indian government to the mulroney government about terrorist threats towards air india flights questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented the governor generalincouncil in  appointed the former supreme court justice john major to conduct a commission of inquiry his report was completed and released on  june  near the end of his first term mulroney gave a formal apology and a  million compensation package to the families of the  japanese canadians who had been divested of their property and interned during world war ii foreign policy mulroneys government opposed the apartheid regime in south africa and he met with many of the regimes opposition leaders throughout his tenure his position put him at odds with the american and british governments but also won him respect elsewhere also external affairs minister joe clark was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated ethiopia to lead the western response to the – famine in that country clark landed in addis ababa so quickly he had not even seen the cbc report that had created the initial and strong public reaction canadas response was overwhelming and led the usa and britain to follow suit almost immediately — an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time since ethiopia had a marxist regime and had previously been isolated by western governments the mulroney government also took a strong stand against the us intervention in nicaragua under reagan and accepted refugees from el salvador guatemala and other countries with repressive regimes supported directly by the reagan administration free trade during his tenure as prime minister brian mulroneys close relationship with us president ronald reagan helped secure a landmark treaty on acid rain and the ratification of a freetrade treaty with the united states under which all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by  critics noted that mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the  leadership campaign this agreement was controversial and the senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote the canadaus free trade agreement was the central issue of the  election with the liberals and ndp opposing it with the liberals gaining the initial momentum a successful counterattack by allan gregg resulted in the pcs being reelected with a solid but reduced majority and  percent of the popular vote mulroney thus became the only conservative in the th century to lead his party to consecutive majority governments during peacetime in this election mulroney transferred to another eastern quebec seat charlevoix after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include baiecomeau on election day november   mulroney made a controversial order in council which allowed the establishment of the amex bank of canada owned by american express second mandate – mulroneys second term was marked by an economic recession he proposed the introduction of a national sales tax the goods and services tax gst in  when it was introduced in  it replaced the manufacturers sales tax mst that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in canada a bitter senate battle ensued and many polls showed that as many as  of canadians were opposed to the tax mulroney had to use section  the deadlock clause a little known constitutional provision allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the queen to appoint  new senators although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase but a tax shift the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular and many resented mulroneys use of an emergency clause in the constitution the meech lake accord also met its doom in  it was not ratified by the provincial governments of manitoba and newfoundland before the june ratification deadline this failure sparked a revival of quebec separatism and led to another round of meetings in charlottetown in  and  these negotiations culminated in the charlottetown accord which outlined extensive changes to the constitution including recognition of quebec as a distinct society however the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in october  many blamed the gst battle and mulroneys unpopularity for the fall of the accord in  mulroney nominated ray hnatyshyn an mp from saskatoon and a former cabinet minister to be governor general – on december   canada became the first western nation to recognize ukraine as an independent country next day after the landslide referendum in favor of independence in ukraine nafta initialing ceremony october  from left to right standing mexican president salinas us president bush prime minister mulroney seated jaime serra puche carla hills michael wilson the worldwide recession of the early s significantly damaged the governments financial situation mulroneys inability to improve the governments finances as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his probusiness plan which had increased the deficit at the same time the bank of canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in canada annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels reaching  billion in his last year of office these deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of  of gdp further weakening the canadian dollar and damaging canadas international credit rating mulroney supported the united nations coalition during the  gulf war and when the un authorized full use of force in the operation canada sent a cf squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of the royal canadian regiment to safeguard these ground elements calling canadas participation operation friction in august he sent the destroyers hmcs terra nova and hmcs athabaskan to enforce the trade blockade against iraq the supply ship hmcs protecteur was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces when the air war began canadas planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets this was the first time since the fighting on cyprus in  that canadian forces participated directly in combat operations for the canadian forces the mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment most members of the cf welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services replacing the single green uniform worn since unification – a white paper proposed boosting the cfs combat capability which had according to canadian defence quarterly declined so badly that canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the gulf war had it desired to the cf in this period did undergo a muchneeded modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms many proposed reforms however failed to occur and according to historian jl granatstein mulroney raised the militarys hopes repeatedly but failed to deliver in  he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to  troops but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below  by  this was however in step with other nato countries after the end of the cold war the mulroney government undertook a defence policy review publishing a new statement in late  but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the post cold war era was arrived at before the governments defeat in  according to granatstein this meant that canada was not able to live up to its postcold war military commitments the decline of cod stocks in atlantic canada led the mulroney government to impose a moratorium on the cod fishery there putting an end to a large portion of the newfoundland fishing industry and causing serious economic hardship the government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the atlantic provinces the environment was a key focus of mulroneys government as canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the un conference on the environment his government added significant new national parks bruce peninsula south moresby and grasslands and passed the canadian environmental assessment act and canadian environmental protection act retirement widespread public resentment of the goods and services tax an economic slump the fracturing of his political coalition and his lack of results regarding the quebec situation caused mulroneys popularity to decline considerably during his second term an ominous sign was a  byelection in the alberta riding of beaver river in this election called when tory mp john dahmer died before ever having a chance to attend a sitting reform party candidate deborah grey won by a hefty  votes after finishing fourth in the general election just five months earlier this was perhaps the first sign that mulroneys grand coalition was fracturing the pcs had dominated albertas federal politics since the  election another sign came before meech lake was finalized when bouchard resigned from both the cabinet and the party over changes to the proposal that he felt diluted its spirit after the failure of meech bouchard convinced several other tories to break with the party and join him to form the bloc québécois a prosovereigntist ie independentist party years later mulroney said that his biggest error as prime minister had been trusting his former university friend indeed he and bouchard have not spoken to each other in over two decades mulroney entered  facing a statutory general election under canadian law federal governments can have a maximum duration of five years but they often have lesser duration as they must enjoy the confidence of the house of commons in order to continue in office by this time his approval ratings had dipped into the teens and were at  in a  gallup poll making him one of the most unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in canada in the s there was a consensus that mulroney would be heavily defeated by jean chrétien and the liberals if he led the tories into the next election—ironically the same situation that led to trudeaus departure from the scene nine years earlier he announced his retirement from politics in february and was replaced as prime minister by defence minister kim campbell in june the last gallup poll taken before his retirement in february  showed his approval ratings had rebounded to  in his final days in office mulroney made several decisions that hampered the tory campaign later that year he took a lavish international farewell tour mostly at taxpayers expense without transacting any official business also by the time he handed power to campbell there were only twoandahalf months left in the tories fiveyear mandate further compounding the problem mulroney continued to live at  sussex drive for some time after campbell was sworn in as prime minister brian and mila mulroneys new private residence in montreal was undergoing renovations and they did not move out of  sussex until their new home was ready instead campbell took up residence at harrington lake the prime ministers official summer retreat across the river in gatineau park quebec the  election was a disaster for the tories the oldest party in canada was reduced from a majority with  seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level the seat loss far exceeded the seat loss the liberals suffered in  the tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the house of commons since the required minimum number of seats for official party status is  as an example of the antipathy toward mulroney his former riding fell to the bloc by a lopsided margin the tory candidate finished a distant third with only  votes—just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit in her memoirs time and chance and in her response in the national post to the secret mulroney tapes campbell said that mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the tories reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off campbell went as far as to claim that mulroney knew the tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election and wanted a scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity rather than a true successor airbusschreiber affair main article airbus affair in  mulroney settled a libel lawsuit he had brought against the government of canada two years previously mulroney received an apology and a  million reimbursement for legal and public relations costs at issue were allegations that mulroney had accepted bribes in the airbus affair concerning government contracts the government said the charges could not be substantiated the principal royal canadian mounted police rcmp investigator on the case retired a year later the government later dropped the investigation entirely but a key fact was unknown in  and had not been elicited under sworn testimony in which mulroney had denied business dealings or significant meetings with a business associate mulroney later confirmed that he had personally accepted cash payments from his business associate karlheinz schreiber a germancanadian businessman who had been a paid broker for airbus and other companies the cash changed hands in three secret meetings in hotels in montreal and new york city in brown paper bags of  bills totaling either  according to mulroney or  according to schrieber the payments occurred over an month period beginning in  when mulroney had stepped down as prime minister but was still a member of parliament in  mulroney stated that he had kept the cash paid in new york in a new york safe deposit box thus implying that he had not illegally carried it undeclared across the uscanada border and in a safe in his montreal home the cash payments had not then been declared as income for tax purposes schreiber had at his disposal  million from airbus for the payment of secret commissions cbc television reported on february   that the money schreiber paid to mulroney originated in a swiss bank account codenamed frankfurt schreiber used the same account to pay the secret airbus commissions schreiber transferred  from frankfurt to an account in zürich codenamed britan on july   and used these funds to make the three cash payments to mulroney in  and  five years after the payments began mulroney and schreiber met again in a suite at the hotel savoy in zurich switzerland schreiber claims mulroney tried to extract a promise schreiber would never reveal the payments schreiber also claims mulroneys attorneys later tried to induce him into perjury by asking that he sign an affidavit falsely stating that he had never paid any money to mulroney mulroney denies this and also denies schreibers claim that the payments totaled  testifying before the house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney said the cash payments were for lobbying foreign leaders to buy armored vehicles from thyssen industries a company schreiber represented mulroney said schreiber had paid him as a consultant for this task only in the context of the potential bear head project which had actually been canceled three years prior to his accepting payment mulroney said he never had a written contract made written reports or issued receipts for the cash payments mulroney said he had destroyed records related to the transactions and received the payments in cash mulroney denied any illegal wrongdoing he admitted to errors in judgment and apologized for the impropriety mulroney described the public revelation of his wrongdoing as a near death experience and said his family had suffered greatly for many years mulroney had not acknowledged receiving money from schreiber the payments were concealed in mulroneys  lawsuit against the government of canada mulroney falsely testified under oath that he never had any dealings with schreiber knew him only peripherally and they had a cup of coffee once or twice in his  book a secret trial former law professor william kaplan describes mulroneys testimony as evasive incomplete and misleading in his testimony schreiber made allegations that described a canadian party leader subverted and deposed by foreign interests of federal contracts being used to funnel money back to those interests of bidrigging and kickbacks mulroney and schreiber question each others truthfulness and credibility in his testimony to the canadian house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney pointed out contradictory statements schreiber has made over the years including statements made under oath mulroney also stated that the work he had performed for his armstrading business associate schreiber was outofcountry rather than lobbying his own canadian government – such as lobbying the late president boris yeltsin that russia buy arms yet to be made in canada schreiber had been incarcerated in canada following his  arrest on a german warrant for tax evasion and is currently june  free on bail mulroney did not declare the income or pay taxes on it until years later when schreiber had come under criminal investigation in germany erik nielsen former deputy prime minister for mulroney stated disbelief in mulroneys account and denied his credibility i think there was a phrase that attached to brian years ago where he was known as lyin brian and for my own part i believe that theyre both in the same boat — schreiber and mulroney canadian prime minister stephen harper had called a public inquiry in november  and appointed future governor general david lloyd johnston as a special adviser to study the matter and prepare terms of reference for the inquiry johnston had once reported directly to mulroney during his term as prime minister johnston reported to harper on january   that he had found  significant questions which required further examination harper accepted the report and stated that a limited public inquiry process would begin once the house of commons ethics committee finished its work schreiber lost his fight against extradition to germany where he is at the center of a political bribery scandal that helped bring down a government and damaged the legacy of former chancellor helmut kohl he appeared before the house of commons ethics committee three times in late november and early december  and again in february  and will likely be called upon to testify at the future limited public inquiry mulroney appeared before the ethics committee on december   six weeks later his lawyers submitted a letter to paul szabo the ethics committee chairman indicating that their client would not appear again before the committee because of his unfair treatment on december  on february   two days before that scheduled appearance ctv news reported that mr mulroneys lawyer had reiterated mulroneys refusal to reappear before the committee after politics since leaving office mulroney has served as an international business consultant and remains a partner with the law firm ogilvy renault he currently sits on the board of directors of multiple corporations including barrick gold quebecor inc archer daniels midland trizechahn corp toronto cendant corp new york aol latin america inc new york and cognicase inc montreal he is a senior counselor to hicks muse tate  furst a global private equity fund in dallas chairman of forbes global new york and was a paid consultant and lobbyist for karlheinz schreiber beginning in  he is also chairman of various international advisory boards and councils for many international companies including power corp montreal bombardier montreal the china international trust and investment corp beijing jp morgan chase and co new york violy byorum and partners new york vsa communications partners new york independent newspapers dublin and general enterprise management services limited british virgin islands in  mulroney was accorded canadas highest civilian honour when he was made a companion of the order of canada at the funeral of ronald reagan with former soviet president mikhail gorbachev former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and former british prime minister margaret thatcher in  mulroney received the woodrow wilson award for public service from the woodrow wilson international center for scholars of the smithsonian institution at a ceremony in montreal the award was in recognition of his career in politics in january  mulroney delivered a keynote speech in washington dc celebrating the tenth anniversary of the north american free trade agreement in june  mulroney presented a eulogy for former us president ronald reagan during the latters state funeral mulroney and former british prime minister margaret thatcher were the first foreign dignitaries to eulogize at a funeral for an american president two years later at the request of prime minister stephen harper mulroney traveled to washington dc along with michael wilson canadas ambassador to the united states as canadas representatives at the state funeral of former president gerald ford in february  as part of a physical examination a ct scan revealed two small lumps in one of mulroneys lungs in his youth mulroney had been a heavy smoker his doctors performed a biopsy which ruled out cancer his surgery is sometimes cited as an example of the dangers of unnecessary testing he recovered well enough to tape a speech for the conservative party of canadas  policy convention in montreal in march though he could not attend in person he later developed pancreatitis and he remained in hospital for several weeks it was not until april  that his son ben mulroney announced he was recovering and would soon be releasedcitation needed on september   veteran writer and former mulroney confidant peter c newman released the secret mulroney tapes unguarded confessions of a prime minister based in large part on remarks from the former prime minister which newman had taped with mulroneys knowledge the book set off national controversy newman had been given unfettered access to mulroney for a thorough biography and claims mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers after the falling out mulroney began work on his autobiography without newmans help mulroney himself has declared that he showed poor judgement in making such unguarded statements but he says that he will have to live with it this led mulroney to respond at the annual press gallery dinner which is noted for comedic moments in ottawa october   the former prime minister appeared on tape and very formally acknowledged the various dignitaries and audience groups before delivering the shortest speech of the night peter newman go fuck yourself thank you ladies and gentlemen and good night thirteen years after leaving office mulroney was named the greenest prime minister in canadian history by a member panel at an event organized by corporate knights magazine in  mulroney became the chairman of quebecor and defused tensions resulting from the continuing influence of former president and ceo pierre karl péladeau current political affiliation mulroney joined the conservative party of canada following its creation in  by the merger of the progressive conservatives and the canadian alliance according to press reports his membership lapsed in  in early  mulroney called a highranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs although he denies this claim legacy mulroneys legacy is complicated and even emotional mulroney makes the case that his onceradical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments and regards this as vindication his deputy prime minister don mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as dragging canada kicking and screaming into the st century mulroneys legacy in canada is associated mostly with the  free trade agreement and the goods and services tax gst although the tories were reelected in  campaigning on free trade they won with only  of the popular vote compared to  of the vote which went to the liberals and the new democratic party who campaigned mostly against the agreement however when the liberals under jean chrétien came to office in  promising to renegotiate key parts of the agreement they continued the deal with only slight changes and signed the north american free trade agreement which expanded the free trade area to include mexico the visibility of the gst proved to be very unpopular the gst was created to help eliminate the evergrowing deficit and to replace the hidden manufacturers sales tax which mulroney argued was hurting business mulroneys usage of a rare constitutional clause to push the tax through prices not falling very much with the mst removed and the in your face nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public the succeeding liberal government of jean chrétien campaigned in  on a promise to eliminate the gst as per the red book but ultimately backed away from that promise this prompted two of their members sheila copps and john nunziata to resign or be expelled in protest mulroneys supporters argue that the gst helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable mulroneys intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years his government had flirted with  percent approval ratings in the early s when mulroneys honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media by canadians in general and by his political colleagues during the  election the progressive conservative party was reduced to just two seats which was seen as partially due to a backlash against mulroney as well as due to the fracturing of his grand coalition social conservatives found fault with mulroneys government in a variety of areas these include mulroneys opposition to capital punishment and an attempted compromise on abortion fiscal conservatives likewise didnt appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of big government programs and political patronage in the  election nearly all of the tories western support transferred into reform which replaced the pcs as the major rightwing force in canada the tories only won two seats west of quebec in the next decade and recovered only upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late s the canadian right was not reunited until they merged with reforms successor the canadian alliance in december  to form the new conservative party of canada mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger at a time when former pc leaders joe clark jean charest and kim campbell either opposed it or expressed ambivalence military historians norman hillmer and jl granatstein ranked mulroney eighth among canadas prime ministers in their  book prime ministers ranking canadas leaders on march   it was reported by various news outlets that a conservative official claimed mulroney was no longer a member of the party they claimed his membership expired in  and was not renewed additionally mulroney allegedly called a senior party official two months ago to ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease however a mulroney confidante speaking on condition of anonymity called the partys claims preposterous hes part of the history of this party you cant rewrite history if theyre worried about branding then shut the inquiry down theyre the ones who called the inquiry  memoir mulroney appears during an interview speaking about his memoirs mulroneys memoirs  was released on september   mulroney criticizes trudeau for avoiding military service in world war ii and favourably references sources that describe the young trudeau as holding antisemitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators tom axworthy a prominent liberal strategist responded that trudeau should be judged on his mature views historian and former mp and trudeau biographer john english said i dont think it does any good to do this kind of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations an earlier book expressing brian mulroneys own opinions and

scotia a campaign that led to the thenlargest majority in canadian history after graduating from st francis xavier with a degree in political science in  mulroney at first pursued a law degree from dalhousie law school in halifax it was around this time that mulroney also cultivated friendships with the tory premier of nova scotia robert stanfield and his chief adviser dalton camp in his role as an advance man mulroney significantly assisted with stanfields successful  reelection campaign mulroney neglected his studies then fell seriously ill during the winter term was hospitalized and despite getting extensions for several courses because of his illness flunked out of dalhousie his first year he then applied to université laval in quebec city and restarted firstyear law there the

mulroney built a network of friends including lucien bouchard bernard roy michel cogger michael meighen and jean bazin that would play a prominent role in canadian politics for years to come during this time mulroney was still involved in the conservative youth wing and was acquainted with the president of the student federation joe clarkcitation needed mulroney secured a plum temporary appointment in ottawa during the summer of  as the executive assistant to alvin hamilton minister of agriculture then a federal election was called and prime minister diefenbaker appointed hamilton as the acting prime minister for the rest of the campaign hamilton took mulroney with him on the campaign trail where the young organizer gained valuable experience builds reputation gains publicity after graduating from laval in  mulroney joined the montreal law firm now known as norton rose fulbright which at the time was the largest law firm in the commonwealth of nations mulroney twice failed his bar exams but the firm kept him due to his charming personality after ultimately passing his bar exams mulroney was admitted to the quebec bar in  and became a labour lawyer which was then a new and exciting field of law in quebec mulroneys superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation with opponents often polarized and at odds proved ideal for this field he was noted for ending several strikes along the montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer w david angus of stikeman elliott who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaignscitation needed in  dalton camp

victory diefenbaker called for a  leadership convention in toronto mulroney joined with joe clark and others in supporting former justice minister e davie fulton once fulton dropped off the ballot mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to robert stanfield who won mulroney then  would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in quebeccitation needed mulroneys professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the montreal newspaper la presse in doing so mulroney and the papers owner canadian business mogul paul desmarais became friends after his initial difficulties mulroneys reputation in his firm steadily increased and he was made a partner in  mulroneys big break came during the cliche commission in  which was set up by quebec premier robert bourassa to investigate the situation at james bay canadas largest hydroelectric project violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle to ensure the commission was nonpartisan bourassa the liberal premier placed robert cliche a former leader of the provincial new democratic party in charge cliche asked mulroney a progressive conservative and a former student of his to join the commission mulroney asked lucien bouchard to join as counsel the committees proceedings which showed mafia infiltration of the unions made mulroney well known in quebec as the hearings were extensively covered in the media the cliche commissions report was largely adopted by the bourassa government a notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the premier of quebec although bouchard favoured calling in robert bourassa as a witness mulroney refused deeming it a violation of executive privilege mulroney and bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when mulroney ran for reelection in  loses first leadership race – the stanfieldled progressive conservatives lost the  election to the pierre trudeauled liberals leading to stanfields resignation as leader mulroney despite never having run for elected office entered the contest to replace him mulroney and provincial rival claude wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the partys standing in quebec which had supported the federal liberals for decades mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting wagner to the pc party a few years earlier and the two wound up as rivals for quebec delegates most of whom were snared by wagner who even blocked mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention in the leadership race mulroney spent an estimated  far more than the other candidates and earned himself the nickname cadillac candidate at the  leadership convention mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind wagner however his expensive campaign slick image lack of parliamentary experience and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates and he was unable to build upon his base support being overtaken by eventual winner joe clark on the second ballot mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses and his campaign finished deeply in debt following the convention mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in clarks caucus business leadership mulroney took the job of executive vice president of the iron ore company of canada a joint subsidiary of three major us steel corporations mulroney earned a salary well into the sixfigure range in  he was appointed company president drawing upon his labour law experience he instituted improved labour relations and with commodity prices on the rise company profits soared during the next several years in  mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the schefferville mine winning a generous settlement for the affected workers under his leadership the company was sold off to foreign interests in the wake of his loss in the  leadership race mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years he credits his loyal wife mila with helping him recover in  he permanently became a teetotaler during his ioc term he made liberal use of the companys executive jet frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country as his business reputation grew he was invited onto several corporate boards he declined an offer to run in a quebec byelection as a federal liberal party leader joe clark led the progressive conservative party to a minority government in the  federal election which ended  years of continuous liberal rule however the government fell after a successful noconfidence motion over his minority governments budget in december  the pcs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to trudeau and the liberals many tories were also annoyed with clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in june  by late  joe clarks leadership of the progressive conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many tory members of parliament despite his solid national lead over prime minister pierre trudeau in opinion polls which stretched to  percent in summer  mulroney on the floor of the  leadership convention photograph by alasdair roberts mulroney while publicly endorsing clark at a press conference in  organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the partys leadership review clarks key quebec organizer rodrigue pageau was in fact a double agent working for mulroney undermining clarks support when clark received an endorsement by only  per cent of delegates at the party convention in january  in winnipeg he resigned and ran to regain his post at the  leadership convention despite still not being a member of parliament mulroney ran against him campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before mulroney had been criticized in  for lacking policy depth and substance a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early s which were collected into a book where i stand published in  mulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign for which he had been criticized mulroney was elected party leader on june   beating clark on the fourth ballot attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native quebec two months later mulroney entered parliament as the mp for central nova in nova scotia winning a byelection in what was then considered a safe tory seat after elmer mackay stood aside in his favour this is a common practice in most parliamentary systems throughout his political career mulroneys fluency in english and french with quebec roots in both cultures gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive because of health problems shortly after becoming party leader mulroney quit smoking in  by the start of  as mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the house of commons the tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling it was almost taken for granted that trudeau would be heavily defeated by mulroney in the general election due no later than  trudeau announced his retirement in february and the liberal party chose john turner previously the minister of finance under trudeau in the s as its new leader the liberals then surged in the polls to take a lead after trailing by more than  percentage points only four days after being sworn in as prime minister turner called a general election for september in so doing he had to postpone a planned canadian summer visit by queen elizabeth ii who makes it her policy to not travel abroad during foreign election campaigns but the liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray leading to a weak campaign the campaign is best remembered for mulroneys attacks on a raft of liberal patronage appointments in his final days in office trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of senators judges and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards widely seen as a way to offer plum jobs to loyal members of the liberal party upon assuming office turner who had been out of politics for nine years while he earned a lucrative salary as a toronto lawyer showed that his political instincts had diminished he had been under pressure to advise sauvé to cancel the appointments—which convention would have required sauvé to do however turner chose not to do so and instead proceeded to appoint several more liberals to prominent political offices per a signed legal agreement with trudeau ironically turner had planned to attack mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory in a televised leaders debate turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old union nationale in quebec however mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of liberal patronage appointments he demanded that turner apologize to the country for making these horrible appointments turner replied that i had no option except to let the appointments stand mulroney famously responded you had an option sir you could have said i am not going to do it this is wrong for canada and i am not going to ask canadians to pay the price you had an option sir—to say no—and you chose to say yes to the old attitudes and the old stories of the liberal party that sir if i may say respectfully is not good enough for canadians turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from mulroney he could repeat only i had no option a visibly angry mulroney called this an avowal of failure and a confession of nonleadership the exchange led most papers the next day with most of them paraphrasing mulroneys counterattack as you had an option sir—you could have said no many observers believe that at this point mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister on september  mulroney and the tories won the largest majority government in canadian history they took  seats three more than their previous record in  the liberals won only  seats which at the time was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in canadian history the conservatives won just over half of the popular vote compared to  percent in  and led in every province emerging as a national party for the first time since  especially important was the tories performance in mulroneys home province quebec the tories had only won the most seats in that province once since  – the  tory landslide however largely due to anger at trudeau and mulroneys promise of a new deal for quebec the province swung over dramatically to support him the tories had only won one seat out of  in  but took  seats in  mulroney yielded central nova back to mackay and instead ran in the eastern quebec riding of manicouagan which included baiecomeau in  the canadian press named mulroney newsmaker of the year for the second straight year making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister the other being lester pearson prime minister – first mandate – mila left and brian right mulroney greet rt hon pierre trudeau foreground the first conservative majority government in  years—and only the second in  years—initially seemed to give mulroney a very formidable position the tories had won just over half the popular vote and no other party crossed the seat mark on paper he was free to take canada in any direction he wanted however his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest his support was based on a grand coalition of socially conservative populists from the west quebec nationalists and fiscal conservatives from ontario and atlantic canada such diverse interests became difficult for mulroney to juggle he attempted to appeal to the western provinces whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success by cancelling the national energy program and including a large number of westerners in his cabinet including clark as minister of external affairs however he was not completely successful even aside from economic and constitutional policy for example he moved cf servicing from manitoba to quebec in  even though the manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated and received death threats for exerting pressure on manitoba over french language rights many of mulroneys ministers had little government experience resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals many tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government indeed mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage including the reference to ambassador bryce mackasey as theres no whore like an old whore the new prime ministers handlers were concerned by apparent unpredictability and rumours of drinking mila left and brian right mulroney at andrews air force base in september  one of mulroneys main priorities was to lower the deficit which had increased from  billion under lester b pearson to  billion under pierre eliott trudeau however the countrys debt increased during mulroneys term from  billion to  billion his attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises also impeding his progress was the senate where the liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power led by allan maceachen the senate took a very assertive role in legislation forcing the government to compromise on several points despite its considerable house majority a major undertaking by mulroneys government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity quebec was the only province that did not sign the new canadian constitution negotiated by prime minister pierre trudeau in  and mulroney wanted to include quebec in a new agreement with the rest of canada in  he negotiated the meech lake accord with the provincial premiers a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy quebecs demand for recognition as a distinct society within canada and to devolve some powers to the provinces the mulroneys with president and mrs reagan in quebec canada march   the day after the famous shamrock summit when the two leaders sang when irish eyes are smiling another of mulroneys priorities was the privatization of many of canadas crown corporations in  the government of canada held  different crown corporations it sold off  of them including air canada which was completely privatized by  although the air canada public participation act continued to make certain requirements of the airline petrocanada was also later privatized the air india flight  bombing which originated in montreal happened during mulroneys first term this was the largest terrorist act before september   with the majority of the  victims being canadian citizens mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then indian prime minister rajiv gandhi which sparked an uproar in canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to mulroney given that the majority of victims were canadian or lived in canada many indocanadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt mulroney did not consider them to be true canadian citizens as they were not of european descentcitation needed furthermore there were several warnings from the indian government to the mulroney government about terrorist threats towards air india flights questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented the governor generalincouncil in  appointed the former supreme court justice john major to conduct a commission of inquiry his report was completed and released on  june  near the end of his first term mulroney gave a formal apology and a  million compensation package to the families of the  japanese canadians who had been divested of their property and interned during world war ii foreign policy mulroneys government opposed the apartheid regime in south africa and he met with many of the regimes opposition leaders throughout his tenure his position put him at odds with the american and british governments but also won him respect elsewhere also external affairs minister joe clark was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated ethiopia to lead the western response to the – famine in that country clark landed in addis ababa so quickly he had not even seen the cbc report that had created the initial and strong public reaction canadas response was overwhelming and led the usa and britain to follow suit almost immediately — an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time since ethiopia had a marxist regime and had previously been isolated by western governments the mulroney government also took a strong stand against the us intervention in nicaragua under reagan and accepted refugees from el salvador guatemala and other countries with repressive regimes supported directly by the reagan administration free trade during his tenure as prime minister brian mulroneys close relationship with us president ronald reagan helped secure a landmark treaty on acid rain and the ratification of a freetrade treaty with the united states under which all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by  critics noted that mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the  leadership campaign this agreement was controversial and the senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote the canadaus free trade agreement was the central issue of the  election with the liberals and ndp opposing it with the liberals gaining the initial momentum a successful counterattack by allan gregg resulted in the pcs being reelected with a solid but reduced majority and  percent of the popular vote mulroney thus became the only conservative in the th century to lead his party to consecutive majority governments during peacetime in this election mulroney transferred to another eastern quebec seat charlevoix after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include baiecomeau on election day november   mulroney made a controversial order in council which allowed the establishment of the amex bank of canada owned by american express second mandate – mulroneys second term was marked by an economic recession he proposed the introduction of a national sales tax the goods and services tax gst in  when it was introduced in  it replaced the manufacturers sales tax mst that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in canada a bitter senate battle ensued and many polls showed that as many as  of canadians were opposed to the tax mulroney had to use section  the deadlock clause a little known constitutional provision allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the queen to appoint  new senators although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase but a tax shift the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular and many resented mulroneys use of an emergency clause in the constitution the meech lake accord also met its doom in  it was not ratified by the provincial governments of manitoba and newfoundland before the june ratification deadline this failure sparked a revival of quebec separatism and led to another round of meetings in charlottetown in  and  these negotiations culminated in the charlottetown accord which outlined extensive changes to the constitution including recognition of quebec as a distinct society however the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in october  many blamed the gst battle and mulroneys unpopularity for the fall of the accord in  mulroney nominated ray hnatyshyn an mp from saskatoon and a former cabinet minister to be governor general – on december   canada became the first western nation to recognize ukraine as an independent country next day after the landslide referendum in favor of independence in ukraine nafta initialing ceremony october  from left to right standing mexican president salinas us president bush prime minister mulroney seated jaime serra puche carla hills michael wilson the worldwide recession of the early s significantly damaged the governments financial situation mulroneys inability to improve the governments finances as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his probusiness plan which had increased the deficit at the same time the bank of canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in canada annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels reaching  billion in his last year of office these deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of  of gdp further weakening the canadian dollar and damaging canadas international credit rating mulroney supported the united nations coalition during the  gulf war and when the un authorized full use of force in the operation canada sent a cf squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of the royal canadian regiment to safeguard these ground elements calling canadas participation operation friction in august he sent the destroyers hmcs terra nova and hmcs athabaskan to enforce the trade blockade against iraq the supply ship hmcs protecteur was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces when the air war began canadas planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets this was the first time since the fighting on cyprus in  that canadian forces participated directly in combat operations for the canadian forces the mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment most members of the cf welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services replacing the single green uniform worn since unification – a white paper proposed boosting the cfs combat capability which had according to canadian defence quarterly declined so badly that canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the gulf war had it desired to the cf in this period did undergo a muchneeded modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms many proposed reforms however failed to occur and according to historian jl granatstein mulroney raised the militarys hopes repeatedly but failed to deliver in  he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to  troops but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below  by  this was however in step with other nato countries after the end of the cold war the mulroney government undertook a defence policy review publishing a new statement in late  but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the post cold war era was arrived at before the governments defeat in  according to granatstein this meant that canada was not able to live up to its postcold war military commitments the decline of cod stocks in atlantic canada led the mulroney government to impose a moratorium on the cod fishery there putting an end to a large portion of the newfoundland fishing industry and causing serious economic hardship the government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the atlantic provinces the environment was a key focus of mulroneys government as canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the un conference on the environment his government added significant new national parks bruce peninsula south moresby and grasslands and passed the canadian environmental assessment act and canadian environmental protection act retirement widespread public resentment of the goods and services tax an economic slump the fracturing of his political coalition and his lack of results regarding the quebec situation caused mulroneys popularity to decline considerably during his second term an ominous sign was a  byelection in the alberta riding of beaver river in this election called when tory mp john dahmer died before ever having a chance to attend a sitting reform party candidate deborah grey won by a hefty  votes after finishing fourth in the general election just five months earlier this was perhaps the first sign that mulroneys grand coalition was fracturing the pcs had dominated albertas federal politics since the  election another sign came before meech lake was finalized when bouchard resigned from both the cabinet and the party over changes to the proposal that he felt diluted its spirit after the failure of meech bouchard convinced several other tories to break with the party and join him to form the bloc québécois a prosovereigntist ie independentist party years later mulroney said that his biggest error as prime minister had been trusting his former university friend indeed he and bouchard have not spoken to each other in over two decades mulroney entered  facing a statutory general election under canadian law federal governments can have a maximum duration of five years but they often have lesser duration as they must enjoy the confidence of the house of commons in order to continue in office by this time his approval ratings had dipped into the teens and were at  in a  gallup poll making him one of the most unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in canada in the s there was a consensus that mulroney would be heavily defeated by jean chrétien and the liberals if he led the tories into the next election—ironically the same situation that led to trudeaus departure from the scene nine years earlier he announced his retirement from politics in february and was replaced as prime minister by defence minister kim campbell in june the last gallup poll taken before his retirement in february  showed his approval ratings had rebounded to  in his final days in office mulroney made several decisions that hampered the tory campaign later that year he took a lavish international farewell tour mostly at taxpayers expense without transacting any official business also by the time he handed power to campbell there were only twoandahalf months left in the tories fiveyear mandate further compounding the problem mulroney continued to live at  sussex drive for some time after campbell was sworn in as prime minister brian and mila mulroneys new private residence in montreal was undergoing renovations and they did not move out of  sussex until their new home was ready instead campbell took up residence at harrington lake the prime ministers official summer retreat across the river in gatineau park quebec the  election was a disaster for the tories the oldest party in canada was reduced from a majority with  seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level the seat loss far exceeded the seat loss the liberals suffered in  the tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the house of commons since the required minimum number of seats for official party status is  as an example of the antipathy toward mulroney his former riding fell to the bloc by a lopsided margin the tory candidate finished a distant third with only  votes—just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit in her memoirs time and chance and in her response in the national post to the secret mulroney tapes campbell said that mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the tories reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off campbell went as far as to claim that mulroney knew the tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election and wanted a scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity rather than a true successor airbusschreiber affair main article airbus affair in  mulroney settled a libel lawsuit he had brought against the government of canada two years previously mulroney received an apology and a  million reimbursement for legal and public relations costs at issue were allegations that mulroney had accepted bribes in the airbus affair concerning government contracts the government said the charges could not be substantiated the principal royal canadian mounted police rcmp investigator on the case retired a year later the government later dropped the investigation entirely but a key fact was unknown in  and had not been elicited under sworn testimony in which mulroney had denied business dealings or significant meetings with a business associate mulroney later confirmed that he had personally accepted cash payments from his business associate karlheinz schreiber a germancanadian businessman who had been a paid broker for airbus and other companies the cash changed hands in three secret meetings in hotels in montreal and new york city in brown paper bags of  bills totaling either  according to mulroney or  according to schrieber the payments occurred over an month period beginning in  when mulroney had stepped down as prime minister but was still a member of parliament in  mulroney stated that he had kept the cash paid in new york in a new york safe deposit box thus implying that he had not illegally carried it undeclared across the uscanada border and in a safe in his montreal home the cash payments had not then been declared as income for tax purposes schreiber had at his disposal  million from airbus for the payment of secret commissions cbc television reported on february   that the money schreiber paid to mulroney originated in a swiss bank account codenamed frankfurt schreiber used the same account to pay the secret airbus commissions schreiber transferred  from frankfurt to an account in zürich codenamed britan on july   and used these funds to make the three cash payments to mulroney in  and  five years after the payments began mulroney and schreiber met again in a suite at the hotel savoy in zurich switzerland schreiber claims mulroney tried to extract a promise schreiber would never reveal the payments schreiber also claims mulroneys attorneys later tried to induce him into perjury by asking that he sign an affidavit falsely stating that he had never paid any money to mulroney mulroney denies this and also denies schreibers claim that the payments totaled  testifying before the house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney said the cash payments were for lobbying foreign leaders to buy armored vehicles from thyssen industries a company schreiber represented mulroney said schreiber had paid him as a consultant for this task only in the context of the potential bear head project which had actually been canceled three years prior to his accepting payment mulroney said he never had a written contract made written reports or issued receipts for the cash payments mulroney said he had destroyed records related to the transactions and received the payments in cash mulroney denied any illegal wrongdoing he admitted to errors in judgment and apologized for the impropriety mulroney described the public revelation of his wrongdoing as a near death experience and said his family had suffered greatly for many years mulroney had not acknowledged receiving money from schreiber the payments were concealed in mulroneys  lawsuit against the government of canada mulroney falsely testified under oath that he never had any dealings with schreiber knew him only peripherally and they had a cup of coffee once or twice in his  book a secret trial former law professor william kaplan describes mulroneys testimony as evasive incomplete and misleading in his testimony schreiber made allegations that described a canadian party leader subverted and deposed by foreign interests of federal contracts being used to funnel money back to those interests of bidrigging and kickbacks mulroney and schreiber question each others truthfulness and credibility in his testimony to the canadian house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney pointed out contradictory statements schreiber has made over the years including statements made under oath mulroney also stated that the work he had performed for his armstrading business associate schreiber was outofcountry rather than lobbying his own canadian government – such as lobbying the late president boris yeltsin that russia buy arms yet to be made in canada schreiber had been incarcerated in canada following his  arrest on a german warrant for tax evasion and is currently june  free on bail mulroney did not declare the income or pay taxes on it until years later when schreiber had come under criminal investigation in germany erik nielsen former deputy prime minister for mulroney stated disbelief in mulroneys account and denied his credibility i think there was a phrase that attached to brian years ago where he was known as lyin brian and for my own part i believe that theyre both in the same boat — schreiber and mulroney canadian prime minister stephen harper had called a public inquiry in november  and appointed future governor general david lloyd johnston as a special adviser to study the matter and prepare terms of reference for the inquiry johnston had once reported directly to mulroney during his term as prime minister johnston reported to harper on january   that he had found  significant questions which required further examination harper accepted the report and stated that a limited public inquiry process would begin once the house of commons ethics committee finished its work schreiber lost his fight against extradition to germany where he is at the center of a political bribery scandal that helped bring down a government and damaged the legacy of former chancellor helmut kohl he appeared before the house of commons ethics committee three times in late november and early december  and again in february  and will likely be called upon to testify at the future limited public inquiry mulroney appeared before the ethics committee on december   six weeks later his lawyers submitted a letter to paul szabo the ethics committee chairman indicating that their client would not appear again before the committee because of his unfair treatment on december  on february   two days before that scheduled appearance ctv news reported that mr mulroneys lawyer had reiterated mulroneys refusal to reappear before the committee after politics since leaving office mulroney has served as an international business consultant and remains a partner with the law firm ogilvy renault he currently sits on the board of directors of multiple corporations including barrick gold quebecor inc archer daniels midland trizechahn corp toronto cendant corp new york aol latin america inc new york and cognicase inc montreal he is a senior counselor to hicks muse tate  furst a global private equity fund in dallas chairman of forbes global new york and was a paid consultant and lobbyist for karlheinz schreiber beginning in  he is also chairman of various international advisory boards and councils for many international companies including power corp montreal bombardier montreal the china international trust and investment corp beijing jp morgan chase and co new york violy byorum and partners new york vsa communications partners new york independent newspapers dublin and general enterprise management services limited british virgin islands in  mulroney was accorded canadas highest civilian honour when he was made a companion of the order of canada at the funeral of ronald reagan with former soviet president mikhail gorbachev former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and former british prime minister margaret thatcher in  mulroney received the woodrow wilson award for public service from the woodrow wilson international center for scholars of the smithsonian institution at a ceremony in montreal the award was in recognition of his career in politics in january  mulroney delivered a keynote speech in washington dc celebrating the tenth anniversary of the north american free trade agreement in june  mulroney presented a eulogy for former us president ronald reagan during the latters state funeral mulroney and former british prime minister margaret thatcher were the first foreign dignitaries to eulogize at a funeral for an american president two years later at the request of prime minister stephen harper mulroney traveled to washington dc along with michael wilson canadas ambassador to the united states as canadas representatives at the state funeral of former president gerald ford in february  as part of a physical examination a ct scan revealed two small lumps in one of mulroneys lungs in his youth mulroney had been a heavy smoker his doctors performed a biopsy which ruled out cancer his surgery is sometimes cited as an example of the dangers of unnecessary testing he recovered well enough to tape a speech for the conservative party of canadas  policy convention in montreal in march though he could not attend in person he later developed pancreatitis and he remained in hospital for several weeks it was not until april  that his son ben mulroney announced he was recovering and would soon be releasedcitation needed on september   veteran writer and former mulroney confidant peter c newman released the secret mulroney tapes unguarded confessions of a prime minister based in large part on remarks from the former prime minister which newman had taped with mulroneys knowledge the book set off national controversy newman had been given unfettered access to mulroney for a thorough biography and claims mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers after the falling out mulroney began work on his autobiography without newmans help mulroney himself has declared that he showed poor judgement in making such unguarded statements but he says that he will have to live with it this led mulroney to respond at the annual press gallery dinner which is noted for comedic moments in ottawa october   the former prime minister appeared on tape and very formally acknowledged the various dignitaries and audience groups before delivering the shortest speech of the night peter newman go fuck yourself thank you ladies and gentlemen and good night thirteen years after leaving office mulroney was named the greenest prime minister in canadian history by a member panel at an event organized by corporate knights magazine in  mulroney became the chairman of quebecor and defused tensions resulting from the continuing influence of former president and ceo pierre karl péladeau current political affiliation mulroney joined the conservative party of canada following its creation in  by the merger of the progressive conservatives and the canadian alliance according to press reports his membership lapsed in  in early  mulroney called a highranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs although he denies this claim legacy mulroneys legacy is complicated and even emotional mulroney makes the case that his onceradical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments and regards this as vindication his deputy prime minister don mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as dragging canada kicking and screaming into the st century mulroneys legacy in canada is associated mostly with the  free trade agreement and the goods and services tax gst although the tories were reelected in  campaigning on free trade they won with only  of the popular vote compared to  of the vote which went to the liberals and the new democratic party who campaigned mostly against the agreement however when the liberals under jean chrétien came to office in  promising to renegotiate key parts of the agreement they continued the deal with only slight changes and signed the north american free trade agreement which expanded the free trade area to include mexico the visibility of the gst proved to be very unpopular the gst was created to help eliminate the evergrowing deficit and to replace the hidden manufacturers sales tax which mulroney argued was hurting business mulroneys usage of a rare constitutional clause to push the tax through prices not falling very much with the mst removed and the in your face nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public the succeeding liberal government of jean chrétien campaigned in  on a promise to eliminate the gst as per the red book but ultimately backed away from that promise this prompted two of their members sheila copps and john nunziata to resign or be expelled in protest mulroneys supporters argue that the gst helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable mulroneys intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years his government had flirted with  percent approval ratings in the early s when mulroneys honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media by canadians in general and by his political colleagues during the  election the progressive conservative party was reduced to just two seats which was seen as partially due to a backlash against mulroney as well as due to the fracturing of his grand coalition social conservatives found fault with mulroneys government in a variety of areas these include mulroneys opposition to capital punishment and an attempted compromise on abortion fiscal conservatives likewise didnt appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of big government programs and political patronage in the  election nearly all of the tories western support transferred into reform which replaced the pcs as the major rightwing force in canada the tories only won two seats west of quebec in the next decade and recovered only upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late s the canadian right was not reunited until they merged with reforms successor the canadian alliance in december  to form the new conservative party of canada mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger at a time when former pc leaders joe clark jean charest and kim campbell either opposed it or expressed ambivalence military historians norman hillmer and jl granatstein ranked mulroney eighth among canadas prime ministers in their  book prime ministers ranking canadas leaders on march   it was reported by various news outlets that a conservative official claimed mulroney was no longer a member of the party they claimed his membership expired in  and was not renewed additionally mulroney allegedly called a senior party official two months ago to ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease however a mulroney confidante speaking on condition of anonymity called the partys claims preposterous hes part of the history of this party you cant rewrite history if theyre worried about branding then shut the inquiry down theyre the ones who called the inquiry  memoir mulroney appears during an interview speaking about his memoirs mulroneys memoirs  was released on september   mulroney criticizes trudeau for avoiding military service in world war ii and favourably references sources that describe the young trudeau as holding antisemitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators tom axworthy a prominent liberal strategist responded that trudeau should be judged on his mature views historian and former mp and trudeau biographer john english said i dont think it does any good to do this kind of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations an earlier book expressing brian mulroneys own opinions and

scotia a campaign that led to the thenlargest majority in canadian history after graduating from st francis xavier with a degree in political science in  mulroney at first pursued a law degree from

mulroney built a network of friends including lucien bouchard bernard roy michel cogger michael meighen and jean bazin that would play a prominent role in canadian politics for years to come during this time mulroney was still involved in the conservative youth wing and was acquainted with the president of the student federation joe clarkcitation needed mulroney secured a plum temporary appointment in ottawa during the summer of  as the executive assistant to alvin hamilton minister of agriculture then a federal election was called and prime minister diefenbaker appointed hamilton as the acting prime minister for the rest of the campaign hamilton took mulroney with him on the campaign trail where the young organizer gained valuable experience builds reputation gains publicity after graduating from laval in  mulroney joined the montreal law firm now known as norton rose fulbright which at the time was the largest law firm in the commonwealth of nations mulroney twice failed his bar exams but the firm kept him due to his charming personality after ultimately passing his bar exams mulroney was admitted to the quebec bar in  and became a labour lawyer which was then a new and exciting field of law in quebec mulroneys superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation with opponents often polarized and at odds proved ideal for this field he was noted for ending several strikes along the montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer w david angus of stikeman elliott who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaignscitation needed in  dalton camp

victory diefenbaker called for a  leadership convention in toronto mulroney joined with joe clark and others in supporting former justice minister e davie fulton once fulton dropped off the ballot mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to robert stanfield who won mulroney then  would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in quebeccitation needed mulroneys professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the montreal newspaper la presse in doing so mulroney and the papers owner canadian business mogul paul desmarais became friends after his initial difficulties mulroneys reputation in his firm steadily increased and he was made a partner in  mulroneys big break came during the cliche commission in  which was set up by quebec premier robert bourassa to investigate the situation at james bay canadas largest hydroelectric project violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle to ensure the commission was nonpartisan bourassa the liberal premier placed robert cliche a former leader of the provincial new democratic party in charge cliche asked mulroney a progressive conservative and a former student of his to join the commission mulroney asked lucien bouchard to join as counsel the committees proceedings which showed mafia infiltration of the unions made mulroney well known in quebec as the hearings were extensively covered in the media the cliche commissions report was largely adopted by the bourassa government a notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the premier of quebec although bouchard favoured calling in robert bourassa as a witness mulroney refused deeming it a violation of executive privilege mulroney and bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when mulroney ran for reelection in  loses first leadership race – the stanfieldled progressive conservatives lost the  election to the pierre trudeauled liberals leading to stanfields resignation as leader mulroney despite never having run for elected office entered the contest to replace him mulroney and provincial rival claude wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the partys standing in quebec which had supported the federal liberals for decades mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting wagner to the pc party a few years earlier and the two wound up as rivals for quebec delegates most of whom were snared by wagner who even blocked mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention in the leadership race mulroney spent an estimated  far more than the other candidates and earned himself the nickname cadillac candidate at the  leadership convention mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind wagner however his expensive campaign slick image lack of parliamentary experience and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates and he was unable to build upon his base support being overtaken by eventual winner joe clark on the second ballot mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses and his campaign finished deeply in debt following the convention mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in clarks caucus business leadership mulroney took the job of executive vice president of the iron ore company of canada a joint subsidiary of three major us steel corporations mulroney earned a salary well into the sixfigure range in  he was appointed company president drawing upon his labour law experience he instituted improved labour relations and with commodity prices on the rise company profits soared during the next several years in  mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the schefferville mine winning a generous settlement for the affected workers under his leadership the company was sold off to foreign interests in the wake of his loss in the  leadership race mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years he credits his loyal wife mila with helping him recover in  he permanently became a teetotaler during his ioc term he made liberal use of the companys executive jet frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country as his business reputation grew he was invited onto several corporate boards he declined an offer to run in a quebec byelection as a federal liberal party leader joe clark led the progressive conservative party to a minority government in the  federal election which ended  years of continuous liberal rule however the government fell after a successful noconfidence motion over his minority governments budget in december  the pcs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to trudeau and the liberals many tories were also annoyed with clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in june  by late  joe clarks leadership of the progressive conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many tory members of parliament despite his solid national lead over prime minister pierre trudeau in opinion polls which stretched to  percent in summer  mulroney on the floor of the  leadership convention photograph by alasdair roberts mulroney while publicly endorsing clark at a press conference in  organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the partys leadership review clarks key quebec organizer rodrigue pageau was in fact a double agent working for mulroney undermining clarks support when clark received an endorsement by only  per cent of delegates at the party convention in january  in winnipeg he resigned and ran to regain his post at the  leadership convention despite still not being a member of parliament mulroney ran against him campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before mulroney had been criticized in  for lacking policy depth and substance a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early s which were collected into a book where i stand published in  mulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign for which he had been criticized mulroney was elected party leader on june   beating clark on the fourth ballot attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native quebec two months later mulroney entered parliament as the mp for central nova in nova scotia winning a byelection in what was then considered a safe tory seat after elmer mackay stood aside in his favour this is a common practice in most parliamentary systems throughout his political career mulroneys fluency in english and french with quebec roots in both cultures gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive because of health problems shortly after becoming party leader mulroney quit smoking in  by the start of  as mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the house of commons the tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling it was almost taken for granted that trudeau would be heavily defeated by mulroney in the general election due no later than  trudeau announced his retirement in february and the liberal party chose john turner previously the minister of finance under trudeau in the s as its new leader the liberals then surged in the polls to take a lead after trailing by more than  percentage points only four days after being sworn in as prime minister turner called a general election for september in so doing he had to postpone a planned canadian summer visit by queen elizabeth ii who makes it her policy to not travel abroad during foreign election campaigns but the liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray leading to a weak campaign the campaign is best remembered for mulroneys attacks on a raft of liberal patronage appointments in his final days in office trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of senators judges and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards widely seen as a way to offer plum jobs to loyal members of the liberal party upon assuming office turner who had been out of politics for nine years while he earned a lucrative salary as a toronto lawyer showed that his political instincts had diminished he had been under pressure to advise sauvé to cancel the appointments—which convention would have required sauvé to do however turner chose not to do so and instead proceeded to appoint several more liberals to prominent political offices per a signed legal agreement with trudeau ironically turner had planned to attack mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory in a televised leaders debate turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old union nationale in quebec however mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of liberal patronage appointments he demanded that turner apologize to the country for making these horrible appointments turner replied that i had no option except to let the appointments stand mulroney famously responded you had an option sir you could have said i am not going to do it this is wrong for canada and i am not going to ask canadians to pay the price you had an option sir—to say no—and you chose to say yes to the old attitudes and the old stories of the liberal party that sir if i may say respectfully is not good enough for canadians turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from mulroney he could repeat only i had no option a visibly angry mulroney called this an avowal of failure and a confession of nonleadership the exchange led most papers the next day with most of them paraphrasing mulroneys counterattack as you had an option sir—you could have said no many observers believe that at this point mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister on september  mulroney and the tories won the largest majority government in canadian history they took  seats three more than their previous record in  the liberals won only  seats which at the time was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in canadian history the conservatives won just over half of the popular vote compared to  percent in  and led in every province emerging as a national party for the first time since  especially important was the tories performance in mulroneys home province quebec the tories had only won the most seats in that province once since  – the  tory landslide however largely due to anger at trudeau and mulroneys promise of a new deal for quebec the province swung over dramatically to support him the tories had only won one seat out of  in  but took  seats in  mulroney yielded central nova back to mackay and instead ran in the eastern quebec riding of manicouagan which included baiecomeau in  the canadian press named mulroney newsmaker of the year for the second straight year making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister the other being lester pearson prime minister – first mandate – mila left and brian right mulroney greet rt hon pierre trudeau foreground the first conservative majority government in  years—and only the second in  years—initially seemed to give mulroney a very formidable position the tories had won just over half the popular vote and no other party crossed the seat mark on paper he was free to take canada in any direction he wanted however his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest his support was based on a grand coalition of socially conservative populists from the west quebec nationalists and fiscal conservatives from ontario and atlantic canada such diverse interests became difficult for mulroney to juggle he attempted to appeal to the western provinces whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success by cancelling the national energy program and including a large number of westerners in his cabinet including clark as minister of external affairs however he was not completely successful even aside from economic and constitutional policy for example he moved cf servicing from manitoba to quebec in  even though the manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated and received death threats for exerting pressure on manitoba over french language rights many of mulroneys ministers had little government experience resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals many tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government indeed mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage including the reference to ambassador bryce mackasey as theres no whore like an old whore the new prime ministers handlers were concerned by apparent unpredictability and rumours of drinking mila left and brian right mulroney at andrews air force base in september  one of mulroneys main priorities was to lower the deficit which had increased from  billion under lester b pearson to  billion under pierre eliott trudeau however the countrys debt increased during mulroneys term from  billion to  billion his attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises also impeding his progress was the senate where the liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power led by allan maceachen the senate took a very assertive role in legislation forcing the government to compromise on several points despite its considerable house majority a major undertaking by mulroneys government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity quebec was the only province that did not sign the new canadian constitution negotiated by prime minister pierre trudeau in  and mulroney wanted to include quebec in a new agreement with the rest of canada in  he negotiated the meech lake accord with the provincial premiers a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy quebecs demand for recognition as a distinct society within canada and to devolve some powers to the provinces the mulroneys with president and mrs reagan in quebec canada march   the day after the famous shamrock summit when the two leaders sang when irish eyes are smiling another of mulroneys priorities was the privatization of many of canadas crown corporations in  the government of canada held  different crown corporations it sold off  of them including air canada which was completely privatized by  although the air canada public participation act continued to make certain requirements of the airline petrocanada was also later privatized the air india flight  bombing which originated in montreal happened during mulroneys first term this was the largest terrorist act before september   with the majority of the  victims being canadian citizens mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then indian prime minister rajiv gandhi which sparked an uproar in canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to mulroney given that the majority of victims were canadian or lived in canada many indocanadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt mulroney did not consider them to be true canadian citizens as they were not of european descentcitation needed furthermore there were several warnings from the indian government to the mulroney government about terrorist threats towards air india flights questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented the governor generalincouncil in  appointed the former supreme court justice john major to conduct a commission of inquiry his report was completed and released on  june  near the end of his first term mulroney gave a formal apology and a  million compensation package to the families of the  japanese canadians who had been divested of their property and interned during world war ii foreign policy mulroneys government opposed the apartheid regime in south africa and he met with many of the regimes opposition leaders throughout his tenure his position put him at odds with the american and british governments but also won him respect elsewhere also external affairs minister joe clark was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated ethiopia to lead the western response to the – famine in that country clark landed in addis ababa so quickly he had not even seen the cbc report that had created the initial and strong public reaction canadas response was overwhelming and led the usa and britain to follow suit almost immediately — an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time since ethiopia had a marxist regime and had previously been isolated by western governments the mulroney government also took a strong stand against the us intervention in nicaragua under reagan and accepted refugees from el salvador guatemala and other countries with repressive regimes supported directly by the reagan administration free trade during his tenure as prime minister brian mulroneys close relationship with us president ronald reagan helped secure a landmark treaty on acid rain and the ratification of a freetrade treaty with the united states under which all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by  critics noted that mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the  leadership campaign this agreement was controversial and the senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote the canadaus free trade agreement was the central issue of the  election with the liberals and ndp opposing it with the liberals gaining the initial momentum a successful counterattack by allan gregg resulted in the pcs being reelected with a solid but reduced majority and  percent of the popular vote mulroney thus became the only conservative in the th century to lead his party to consecutive majority governments during peacetime in this election mulroney transferred to another eastern quebec seat charlevoix after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include baiecomeau on election day november   mulroney made a controversial order in council which allowed the establishment of the amex bank of canada owned by american express second mandate – mulroneys second term was marked by an economic recession he proposed the introduction of a national sales tax the goods and services tax gst in  when it was introduced in  it replaced the manufacturers sales tax mst that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in canada a bitter senate battle ensued and many polls showed that as many as  of canadians were opposed to the tax mulroney had to use section  the deadlock clause a little known constitutional provision allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the queen to appoint  new senators although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase but a tax shift the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular and many resented mulroneys use of an emergency clause in the constitution the meech lake accord also met its doom in  it was not ratified by the provincial governments of manitoba and newfoundland before the june ratification deadline this failure sparked a revival of quebec separatism and led to another round of meetings in charlottetown in  and  these negotiations culminated in the charlottetown accord which outlined extensive changes to the constitution including recognition of quebec as a distinct society however the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in october  many blamed the gst battle and mulroneys unpopularity for the fall of the accord in  mulroney nominated ray hnatyshyn an mp from saskatoon and a former cabinet minister to be governor general – on december   canada became the first western nation to recognize ukraine as an independent country next day after the landslide referendum in favor of independence in ukraine nafta initialing ceremony october  from left to right standing mexican president salinas us president bush prime minister mulroney seated jaime serra puche carla hills michael wilson the worldwide recession of the early s significantly damaged the governments financial situation mulroneys inability to improve the governments finances as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his probusiness plan which had increased the deficit at the same time the bank of canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in canada annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels reaching  billion in his last year of office these deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of  of gdp further weakening the canadian dollar and damaging canadas international credit rating mulroney supported the united nations coalition during the  gulf war and when the un authorized full use of force in the operation canada sent a cf squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of the royal canadian regiment to safeguard these ground elements calling canadas participation operation friction in august he sent the destroyers hmcs terra nova and hmcs athabaskan to enforce the trade blockade against iraq the supply ship hmcs protecteur was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces when the air war began canadas planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets this was the first time since the fighting on cyprus in  that canadian forces participated directly in combat operations for the canadian forces the mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment most members of the cf welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services replacing the single green uniform worn since unification – a white paper proposed boosting the cfs combat capability which had according to canadian defence quarterly declined so badly that canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the gulf war had it desired to the cf in this period did undergo a muchneeded modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms many proposed reforms however failed to occur and according to historian jl granatstein mulroney raised the militarys hopes repeatedly but failed to deliver in  he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to  troops but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below  by  this was however in step with other nato countries after the end of the cold war the mulroney government undertook a defence policy review publishing a new statement in late  but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the post cold war era was arrived at before the governments defeat in  according to granatstein this meant that canada was not able to live up to its postcold war military commitments the decline of cod stocks in atlantic canada led the mulroney government to impose a moratorium on the cod fishery there putting an end to a large portion of the newfoundland fishing industry and causing serious economic hardship the government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the atlantic provinces the environment was a key focus of mulroneys government as canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the un conference on the environment his government added significant new national parks bruce peninsula south moresby and grasslands and passed the canadian environmental assessment act and canadian environmental protection act retirement widespread public resentment of the goods and services tax an economic slump the fracturing of his political coalition and his lack of results regarding the quebec situation caused mulroneys popularity to decline considerably during his second term an ominous sign was a  byelection in the alberta riding of beaver river in this election called when tory mp john dahmer died before ever having a chance to attend a sitting reform party candidate deborah grey won by a hefty  votes after finishing fourth in the general election just five months earlier this was perhaps the first sign that mulroneys grand coalition was fracturing the pcs had dominated albertas federal politics since the  election another sign came before meech lake was finalized when bouchard resigned from both the cabinet and the party over changes to the proposal that he felt diluted its spirit after the failure of meech bouchard convinced several other tories to break with the party and join him to form the bloc québécois a prosovereigntist ie independentist party years later mulroney said that his biggest error as prime minister had been trusting his former university friend indeed he and bouchard have not spoken to each other in over two decades mulroney entered  facing a statutory general election under canadian law federal governments can have a maximum duration of five years but they often have lesser duration as they must enjoy the confidence of the house of commons in order to continue in office by this time his approval ratings had dipped into the teens and were at  in a  gallup poll making him one of the most unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in canada in the s there was a consensus that mulroney would be heavily defeated by jean chrétien and the liberals if he led the tories into the next election—ironically the same situation that led to trudeaus departure from the scene nine years earlier he announced his retirement from politics in february and was replaced as prime minister by defence minister kim campbell in june the last gallup poll taken before his retirement in february  showed his approval ratings had rebounded to  in his final days in office mulroney made several decisions that hampered the tory campaign later that year he took a lavish international farewell tour mostly at taxpayers expense without transacting any official business also by the time he handed power to campbell there were only twoandahalf months left in the tories fiveyear mandate further compounding the problem mulroney continued to live at  sussex drive for some time after campbell was sworn in as prime minister brian and mila mulroneys new private residence in montreal was undergoing renovations and they did not move out of  sussex until their new home was ready instead campbell took up residence at harrington lake the prime ministers official summer retreat across the river in gatineau park quebec the  election was a disaster for the tories the oldest party in canada was reduced from a majority with  seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level the seat loss far exceeded the seat loss the liberals suffered in  the tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the house of commons since the required minimum number of seats for official party status is  as an example of the antipathy toward mulroney his former riding fell to the bloc by a lopsided margin the tory candidate finished a distant third with only  votes—just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit in her memoirs time and chance and in her response in the national post to the secret mulroney tapes campbell said that mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the tories reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off campbell went as far as to claim that mulroney knew the tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election and wanted a scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity rather than a true successor airbusschreiber affair main article airbus affair in  mulroney settled a libel lawsuit he had brought against the government of canada two years previously mulroney received an apology and a  million reimbursement for legal and public relations costs at issue were allegations that mulroney had accepted bribes in the airbus affair concerning government contracts the government said the charges could not be substantiated the principal royal canadian mounted police rcmp investigator on the case retired a year later the government later dropped the investigation entirely but a key fact was unknown in  and had not been elicited under sworn testimony in which mulroney had denied business dealings or significant meetings with a business associate mulroney later confirmed that he had personally accepted cash payments from his business associate karlheinz schreiber a germancanadian businessman who had been a paid broker for airbus and other companies the cash changed hands in three secret meetings in hotels in montreal and new york city in brown paper bags of  bills totaling either  according to mulroney or  according to schrieber the payments occurred over an month period beginning in  when mulroney had stepped down as prime minister but was still a member of parliament in  mulroney stated that he had kept the cash paid in new york in a new york safe deposit box thus implying that he had not illegally carried it undeclared across the uscanada border and in a safe in his montreal home the cash payments had not then been declared as income for tax purposes schreiber had at his disposal  million from airbus for the payment of secret commissions cbc television reported on february   that the money schreiber paid to mulroney originated in a swiss bank account codenamed frankfurt schreiber used the same account to pay the secret airbus commissions schreiber transferred  from frankfurt to an account in zürich codenamed britan on july   and used these funds to make the three cash payments to mulroney in  and  five years after the payments began mulroney and schreiber met again in a suite at the hotel savoy in zurich switzerland schreiber claims mulroney tried to extract a promise schreiber would never reveal the payments schreiber also claims mulroneys attorneys later tried to induce him into perjury by asking that he sign an affidavit falsely stating that he had never paid any money to mulroney mulroney denies this and also denies schreibers claim that the payments totaled  testifying before the house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney said the cash payments were for lobbying foreign leaders to buy armored vehicles from thyssen industries a company schreiber represented mulroney said schreiber had paid him as a consultant for this task only in the context of the potential bear head project which had actually been canceled three years prior to his accepting payment mulroney said he never had a written contract made written reports or issued receipts for the cash payments mulroney said he had destroyed records related to the transactions and received the payments in cash mulroney denied any illegal wrongdoing he admitted to errors in judgment and apologized for the impropriety mulroney described the public revelation of his wrongdoing as a near death experience and said his family had suffered greatly for many years mulroney had not acknowledged receiving money from schreiber the payments were concealed in mulroneys  lawsuit against the government of canada mulroney falsely testified under oath that he never had any dealings with schreiber knew him only peripherally and they had a cup of coffee once or twice in his  book a secret trial former law professor william kaplan describes mulroneys testimony as evasive incomplete and misleading in his testimony schreiber made allegations that described a canadian party leader subverted and deposed by foreign interests of federal contracts being used to funnel money back to those interests of bidrigging and kickbacks mulroney and schreiber question each others truthfulness and credibility in his testimony to the canadian house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney pointed out contradictory statements schreiber has made over the years including statements made under oath mulroney also stated that the work he had performed for his armstrading business associate schreiber was outofcountry rather than lobbying his own canadian government – such as lobbying the late president boris yeltsin that russia buy arms yet to be made in canada schreiber had been incarcerated in canada following his  arrest on a german warrant for tax evasion and is currently june  free on bail mulroney did not declare the income or pay taxes on it until years later when schreiber had come under criminal investigation in germany erik nielsen former deputy prime minister for mulroney stated disbelief in mulroneys account and denied his credibility i think there was a phrase that attached to brian years ago where he was known as lyin brian and for my own part i believe that theyre both in the same boat — schreiber and mulroney canadian prime minister stephen harper had called a public inquiry in november  and appointed future governor general david lloyd johnston as a special adviser to study the matter and prepare terms of reference for the inquiry johnston had once reported directly to mulroney during his term as prime minister johnston reported to harper on january   that he had found  significant questions which required further examination harper accepted the report and stated that a limited public inquiry process would begin once the house of commons ethics committee finished its work schreiber lost his fight against extradition to germany where he is at the center of a political bribery scandal that helped bring down a government and damaged the legacy of former chancellor helmut kohl he appeared before the house of commons ethics committee three times in late november and early december  and again in february  and will likely be called upon to testify at the future limited public inquiry mulroney appeared before the ethics committee on december   six weeks later his lawyers submitted a letter to paul szabo the ethics committee chairman indicating that their client would not appear again before the committee because of his unfair treatment on december  on february   two days before that scheduled appearance ctv news reported that mr mulroneys lawyer had reiterated mulroneys refusal to reappear before the committee after politics since leaving office mulroney has served as an international business consultant and remains a partner with the law firm ogilvy renault he currently sits on the board of directors of multiple corporations including barrick gold quebecor inc archer daniels midland trizechahn corp toronto cendant corp new york aol latin america inc new york and cognicase inc montreal he is a senior counselor to hicks muse tate  furst a global private equity fund in dallas chairman of forbes global new york and was a paid consultant and lobbyist for karlheinz schreiber beginning in  he is also chairman of various international advisory boards and councils for many international companies including power corp montreal bombardier montreal the china international trust and investment corp beijing jp morgan chase and co new york violy byorum and partners new york vsa communications partners new york independent newspapers dublin and general enterprise management services limited british virgin islands in  mulroney was accorded canadas highest civilian honour when he was made a companion of the order of canada at the funeral of ronald reagan with former soviet president mikhail gorbachev former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and former british prime minister margaret thatcher in  mulroney received the woodrow wilson award for public service from the woodrow wilson international center for scholars of the smithsonian institution at a ceremony in montreal the award was in recognition of his career in politics in january  mulroney delivered a keynote speech in washington dc celebrating the tenth anniversary of the north american free trade agreement in june  mulroney presented a eulogy for former us president ronald reagan during the latters state funeral mulroney and former british prime minister margaret thatcher were the first foreign dignitaries to eulogize at a funeral for an american president two years later at the request of prime minister stephen harper mulroney traveled to washington dc along with michael wilson canadas ambassador to the united states as canadas representatives at the state funeral of former president gerald ford in february  as part of a physical examination a ct scan revealed two small lumps in one of mulroneys lungs in his youth mulroney had been a heavy smoker his doctors performed a biopsy which ruled out cancer his surgery is sometimes cited as an example of the dangers of unnecessary testing he recovered well enough to tape a speech for the conservative party of canadas  policy convention in montreal in march though he could not attend in person he later developed pancreatitis and he remained in hospital for several weeks it was not until april  that his son ben mulroney announced he was recovering and would soon be releasedcitation needed on september   veteran writer and former mulroney confidant peter c newman released the secret mulroney tapes unguarded confessions of a prime minister based in large part on remarks from the former prime minister which newman had taped with mulroneys knowledge the book set off national controversy newman had been given unfettered access to mulroney for a thorough biography and claims mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers after the falling out mulroney began work on his autobiography without newmans help mulroney himself has declared that he showed poor judgement in making such unguarded statements but he says that he will have to live with it this led mulroney to respond at the annual press gallery dinner which is noted for comedic moments in ottawa october   the former prime minister appeared on tape and very formally acknowledged the various dignitaries and audience groups before delivering the shortest speech of the night peter newman go fuck yourself thank you ladies and gentlemen and good night thirteen years after leaving office mulroney was named the greenest prime minister in canadian history by a member panel at an event organized by corporate knights magazine in  mulroney became the chairman of quebecor and defused tensions resulting from the continuing influence of former president and ceo pierre karl péladeau current political affiliation mulroney joined the conservative party of canada following its creation in  by the merger of the progressive conservatives and the canadian alliance according to press reports his membership lapsed in  in early  mulroney called a highranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs although he denies this claim legacy mulroneys legacy is complicated and even emotional mulroney makes the case that his onceradical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments and regards this as vindication his deputy prime minister don mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as dragging canada kicking and screaming into the st century mulroneys legacy in canada is associated mostly with the  free trade agreement and the goods and services tax gst although the tories were reelected in  campaigning on free trade they won with only  of the popular vote compared to  of the vote which went to the liberals and the new democratic party who campaigned mostly against the agreement however when the liberals under jean chrétien came to office in  promising to renegotiate key parts of the agreement they continued the deal with only slight changes and signed the north american free trade agreement which expanded the free trade area to include mexico the visibility of the gst proved to be very unpopular the gst was created to help eliminate the evergrowing deficit and to replace the hidden manufacturers sales tax which mulroney argued was hurting business mulroneys usage of a rare constitutional clause to push the tax through prices not falling very much with the mst removed and the in your face nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public the succeeding liberal government of jean chrétien campaigned in  on a promise to eliminate the gst as per the red book but ultimately backed away from that promise this prompted two of their members sheila copps and john nunziata to resign or be expelled in protest mulroneys supporters argue that the gst helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable mulroneys intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years his government had flirted with  percent approval ratings in the early s when mulroneys honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media by canadians in general and by his political colleagues during the  election the progressive conservative party was reduced to just two seats which was seen as partially due to a backlash against mulroney as well as due to the fracturing of his grand coalition social conservatives found fault with mulroneys government in a variety of areas these include mulroneys opposition to capital punishment and an attempted compromise on abortion fiscal conservatives likewise didnt appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of big government programs and political patronage in the  election nearly all of the tories western support transferred into reform which replaced the pcs as the major rightwing force in canada the tories only won two seats west of quebec in the next decade and recovered only upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late s the canadian right was not reunited until they merged with reforms successor the canadian alliance in december  to form the new conservative party of canada mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger at a time when former pc leaders joe clark jean charest and kim campbell either opposed it or expressed ambivalence military historians norman hillmer and jl granatstein ranked mulroney eighth among canadas prime ministers in their  book prime ministers ranking canadas leaders on march   it was reported by various news outlets that a conservative official claimed mulroney was no longer a member of the party they claimed his membership expired in  and was not renewed additionally mulroney allegedly called a senior party official two months ago to ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease however a mulroney confidante speaking on condition of anonymity called the partys claims preposterous hes part of the history of this party you cant rewrite history if theyre worried about branding then shut the inquiry down theyre the ones who called the inquiry  memoir mulroney appears during an interview speaking about his memoirs mulroneys memoirs  was released on september   mulroney criticizes trudeau for avoiding military service in world war ii and favourably references sources that describe the young trudeau as holding antisemitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators tom axworthy a prominent liberal strategist responded that trudeau should be judged on his mature views historian and former mp and trudeau biographer john english said i dont think it does any good to do this kind of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations an earlier book expressing brian mulroneys own opinions and

scotia a campaign that led to the thenlargest majority in canadian history after graduating from st francis xavier with a degree in political science in  mulroney at first pursued a law degree from dalhousie law school in halifax it was around this time that mulroney also cultivated friendships with the tory premier of nova scotia robert stanfield and his chief adviser dalton camp in his role as an advance man mulroney significantly assisted with stanfields successful  reelection campaign mulroney neglected his studies then fell seriously ill during the winter term was hospitalized and

mulroney built a network of friends including lucien bouchard bernard roy michel cogger michael meighen and jean bazin that would play a prominent role in canadian politics for years to come during this time mulroney was still involved in the conservative youth wing and was acquainted with the president of the student federation joe clarkcitation needed mulroney secured a plum temporary appointment in ottawa during the summer of  as the executive assistant to alvin hamilton minister of agriculture then a federal election was called and prime minister diefenbaker appointed hamilton as the acting prime minister for the rest of the campaign hamilton took mulroney with him on the campaign trail where the young organizer gained valuable experience builds reputation gains publicity after graduating from laval in  mulroney joined the montreal law firm now known as norton rose fulbright which at the time was the largest law firm in the commonwealth of nations mulroney twice failed his bar exams but the firm kept him due to his charming personality after ultimately passing his bar exams mulroney was admitted to the quebec bar in  and became a labour lawyer which was then a new and exciting field of law in quebec mulroneys superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation with opponents often polarized and at odds proved ideal for this field he was noted for ending several strikes along the montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer w david angus of stikeman elliott who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaignscitation needed in  dalton camp who by then was president of the progressive conservative party ran for reelection in what many believed to be a referendum on diefenbakers leadership diefenbaker had reached his th birthday in  mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting camp and opposing diefenbaker but due to his past friendship with diefenbaker he attempted to stay out of the spotlight with camps narrow victory diefenbaker called for a  leadership convention in toronto mulroney joined with joe clark and others in supporting former justice minister e davie fulton once fulton dropped off the ballot mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to robert stanfield who won mulroney then  would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in quebeccitation needed mulroneys professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the montreal newspaper la presse in doing so mulroney and the papers owner canadian business mogul paul desmarais became friends after his initial difficulties mulroneys reputation in his firm steadily increased and he was made a partner in  mulroneys big break came during the cliche commission in  which was set up by quebec premier robert bourassa to investigate the situation at james bay canadas largest hydroelectric project violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle to ensure the commission was nonpartisan bourassa the liberal premier placed robert cliche a former leader of the provincial new democratic party in charge cliche asked mulroney a progressive conservative and a former student of his to join the commission mulroney asked lucien bouchard to join as counsel the committees proceedings which showed mafia infiltration of the unions made mulroney well known in quebec as the hearings were extensively covered in the media the cliche commissions report was largely adopted by the bourassa government a notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the premier of quebec although bouchard favoured calling in robert bourassa as a witness mulroney refused deeming it a violation of executive privilege mulroney and bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when mulroney ran for reelection in  loses first leadership race – the stanfieldled progressive conservatives lost the  election to the pierre trudeauled liberals leading to stanfields resignation as leader mulroney despite never having run for elected office entered the contest to replace him mulroney and provincial rival claude wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the partys standing in quebec which had supported the federal liberals for decades mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting wagner to the pc party a few years earlier and the two wound up as rivals for quebec delegates most of whom were snared by wagner who even blocked mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention in the leadership race mulroney spent an estimated  far more than the other candidates and earned himself the nickname cadillac candidate at the  leadership convention mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind wagner however his expensive campaign slick image lack of parliamentary experience and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates and he was unable to build upon his base support being overtaken by eventual winner joe clark on the second ballot mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses and his campaign finished deeply in debt following the convention mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in clarks caucus business leadership mulroney took the job of executive vice president of the iron ore company of canada a joint subsidiary of three major us steel corporations mulroney earned a salary well into the sixfigure range in  he was appointed company president drawing upon his labour law experience he instituted improved labour relations and with commodity prices on the rise company profits soared during the next several years in  mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the schefferville mine winning a generous settlement for the affected workers under his leadership the company was sold off to foreign interests in the wake of his loss in the  leadership race mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years he credits his loyal wife mila with helping him recover in  he permanently became a teetotaler during his ioc term he made liberal use of the companys executive jet frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country as his business reputation grew he was invited onto several corporate boards he declined an offer to run in a quebec byelection as a federal liberal party leader joe clark led the progressive conservative party to a minority government in the  federal election which ended  years of continuous liberal rule however the government fell after a successful noconfidence motion over his minority governments budget in december  the pcs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to trudeau and the liberals many tories were also annoyed with clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in june  by late  joe clarks leadership of the progressive conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many tory members of parliament despite his solid national lead over prime minister pierre trudeau in opinion polls which stretched to  percent in summer  mulroney on the floor of the  leadership convention photograph by alasdair roberts mulroney while publicly endorsing clark at a press conference in  organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the partys leadership review clarks key quebec organizer rodrigue pageau was in fact a double agent working for mulroney undermining clarks support when clark received an endorsement by only  per cent of delegates at the party convention in january  in winnipeg he resigned and ran to regain his post at the  leadership convention despite still not being a member of parliament mulroney ran against him campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before mulroney had been criticized in  for lacking policy depth and substance a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early s which were collected into a book where i stand published in  mulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign for which he had been criticized mulroney was elected party leader on june   beating clark on the fourth ballot attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native quebec two months later mulroney entered parliament as the mp for central nova in nova scotia winning a byelection in what was then considered a safe tory seat after elmer mackay stood aside in his favour this is a common practice in most parliamentary systems throughout his political career mulroneys fluency in english and french with quebec roots in both cultures gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive because of health problems shortly after becoming party leader mulroney quit smoking in  by the start of  as mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the house of commons the tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling it was almost taken for granted that trudeau would be heavily defeated by mulroney in the general election due no later than  trudeau announced his retirement in february and the liberal party chose john turner previously the minister of finance under trudeau in the s as its new leader the liberals then surged in the polls to take a lead after trailing by more than  percentage points only four days after being sworn in as prime minister turner called a general election for september in so doing he had to postpone a planned canadian summer visit by queen elizabeth ii who makes it her policy to not travel abroad during foreign election campaigns but the liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray leading to a weak campaign the campaign is best remembered for mulroneys attacks on a raft of liberal patronage appointments in his final days in office trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of senators judges and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards widely seen as a way to offer plum jobs to loyal members of the liberal party upon assuming office turner who had been out of politics for nine years while he earned a lucrative salary as a toronto lawyer showed that his political instincts had diminished he had been under pressure to advise sauvé to cancel the appointments—which convention would have required sauvé to do however turner chose not to do so and instead proceeded to appoint several more liberals to prominent political offices per a signed legal agreement with trudeau ironically turner had planned to attack mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory in a televised leaders debate turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old union nationale in quebec however mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of liberal patronage appointments he demanded that turner apologize to the country for making these horrible appointments turner replied that i had no option except to let the appointments stand mulroney famously responded you had an option sir you could have said i am not going to do it this is wrong for canada and i am not going to ask canadians to pay the price you had an option sir—to say no—and you chose to say yes to the old attitudes and the old stories of the liberal party that sir if i may say respectfully is not good enough for canadians turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from mulroney he could repeat only i had no option a visibly angry mulroney called this an avowal of failure and a confession of nonleadership the exchange led most papers the next day with most of them paraphrasing mulroneys counterattack as you had an option sir—you could have said no many observers believe that at this point mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister on september  mulroney and the tories won the largest majority government in canadian history they took  seats three more than their previous record in  the liberals won only  seats which at the time was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in canadian history the conservatives won just over half of the popular vote compared to  percent in  and led in every province emerging as a national party for the first time since  especially important was the tories performance in mulroneys home province quebec the tories had only won the most seats in that province once since  – the  tory landslide however largely due to anger at trudeau and mulroneys promise of a new deal for quebec the province swung over dramatically to support him the tories had only won one seat out of  in  but took  seats in  mulroney yielded central nova back to mackay and instead ran in the eastern quebec riding of manicouagan which included baiecomeau in  the canadian press named mulroney newsmaker of the year for the second straight year making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister the other being lester pearson prime minister – first mandate – mila left and brian right mulroney greet rt hon pierre trudeau foreground the first conservative majority government in  years—and only the second in  years—initially seemed to give mulroney a very formidable position the tories had won just over half the popular vote and no other party crossed the seat mark on paper he was free to take canada in any direction he wanted however his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest his support was based on a grand coalition of socially conservative populists from the west quebec nationalists and fiscal conservatives from ontario and atlantic canada such diverse interests became difficult for mulroney to juggle he attempted to appeal to the western provinces whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success by cancelling the national energy program and including a large number of westerners in his cabinet including clark as minister of external affairs however he was not completely successful even aside from economic and constitutional policy for example he moved cf servicing from manitoba to quebec in  even though the manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated and received death threats for exerting pressure on manitoba over french language rights many of mulroneys ministers had little government experience resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals many tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government indeed mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage including the reference to ambassador bryce mackasey as theres no whore like an old whore the new prime ministers handlers were concerned by apparent unpredictability and rumours of drinking mila left and brian right mulroney at andrews air force base in september  one of mulroneys main priorities was to lower the deficit which had increased from  billion under lester b pearson to  billion under pierre eliott trudeau however the countrys debt increased during mulroneys term from  billion to  billion his attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises also impeding his progress was the senate where the liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power led by allan maceachen the senate took a very assertive role in legislation forcing the government to compromise on several points despite its considerable house majority a major undertaking by mulroneys government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity quebec was the only province that did not sign the new canadian constitution negotiated by prime minister pierre trudeau in  and mulroney wanted to include quebec in a new agreement with the rest of canada in  he negotiated the meech lake accord with the provincial premiers a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy quebecs demand for recognition as a distinct society within canada and to devolve some powers to the provinces the mulroneys with president and mrs reagan in quebec canada march   the day after the famous shamrock summit when the two leaders sang when irish eyes are smiling another of mulroneys priorities was the privatization of many of canadas crown corporations in  the government of canada held  different crown corporations it sold off  of them including air canada which was completely privatized by  although the air canada public participation act continued to make certain requirements of the airline petrocanada was also later privatized the air india flight  bombing which originated in montreal happened during mulroneys first term this was the largest terrorist act before september   with the majority of the  victims being canadian citizens mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then indian prime minister rajiv gandhi which sparked an uproar in canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to mulroney given that the majority of victims were canadian or lived in canada many indocanadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt mulroney did not consider them to be true canadian citizens as they were not of european descentcitation needed furthermore there were several warnings from the indian government to the mulroney government about terrorist threats towards air india flights questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented the governor generalincouncil in  appointed the former supreme court justice john major to conduct a commission of inquiry his report was completed and released on  june  near the end of his first term mulroney gave a formal apology and a  million compensation package to the families of the  japanese canadians who had been divested of their property and interned during world war ii foreign policy mulroneys government opposed the apartheid regime in south africa and he met with many of the regimes opposition leaders throughout his tenure his position put him at odds with the american and british governments but also won him respect elsewhere also external affairs minister joe clark was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated ethiopia to lead the western response to the – famine in that country clark landed in addis ababa so quickly he had not even seen the cbc report that had created the initial and strong public reaction canadas response was overwhelming and led the usa and britain to follow suit almost immediately — an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time since ethiopia had a marxist regime and had previously been isolated by western governments the mulroney government also took a strong stand against the us intervention in nicaragua under reagan and accepted refugees from el salvador guatemala and other countries with repressive regimes supported directly by the reagan administration free trade during his tenure as prime minister brian mulroneys close relationship with us president ronald reagan helped secure a landmark treaty on acid rain and the ratification of a freetrade treaty with the united states under which all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by  critics noted that mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the  leadership campaign this agreement was controversial and the senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote the canadaus free trade agreement was the central issue of the  election with the liberals and ndp opposing it with the liberals gaining the initial momentum a successful counterattack by allan gregg resulted in the pcs being reelected with a solid but reduced majority and  percent of the popular vote mulroney thus became the only conservative in the th century to lead his party to consecutive majority governments during peacetime in this election mulroney transferred to another eastern quebec seat charlevoix after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include baiecomeau on election day november   mulroney made a controversial order in council which allowed the establishment of the amex bank of canada owned by american express second mandate – mulroneys second term was marked by an economic recession he proposed the introduction of a national sales tax the goods and services tax gst in  when it was introduced in  it replaced the manufacturers sales tax mst that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in canada a bitter senate battle ensued and many polls showed that as many as  of canadians were opposed to the tax mulroney had to use section  the deadlock clause a little known constitutional provision allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the queen to appoint  new senators although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase but a tax shift the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular and many resented mulroneys use of an emergency clause in the constitution the meech lake accord also met its doom in  it was not ratified by the provincial governments of manitoba and newfoundland before the june ratification deadline this failure sparked a revival of quebec separatism and led to another round of meetings in charlottetown in  and  these negotiations culminated in the charlottetown accord which outlined extensive changes to the constitution including recognition of quebec as a distinct society however the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in october  many blamed the gst battle and mulroneys unpopularity for the fall of the accord in  mulroney nominated ray hnatyshyn an mp from saskatoon and a former cabinet minister to be governor general – on december   canada became the first western nation to recognize ukraine as an independent country next day after the landslide referendum in favor of independence in ukraine nafta initialing ceremony october  from left to right standing mexican president salinas us president bush prime minister mulroney seated jaime serra puche carla hills michael wilson the worldwide recession of the early s significantly damaged the governments financial situation mulroneys inability to improve the governments finances as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his probusiness plan which had increased the deficit at the same time the bank of canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in canada annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels reaching  billion in his last year of office these deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of  of gdp further weakening the canadian dollar and damaging canadas international credit rating mulroney supported the united nations coalition during the  gulf war and when the un authorized full use of force in the operation canada sent a cf squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of the royal canadian regiment to safeguard these ground elements calling canadas participation operation friction in august he sent the destroyers hmcs terra nova and hmcs athabaskan to enforce the trade blockade against iraq the supply ship hmcs protecteur was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces when the air war began canadas planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets this was the first time since the fighting on cyprus in  that canadian forces participated directly in combat operations for the canadian forces the mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment most members of the cf welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services replacing the single green uniform worn since unification – a white paper proposed boosting the cfs combat capability which had according to canadian defence quarterly declined so badly that canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the gulf war had it desired to the cf in this period did undergo a muchneeded modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms many proposed reforms however failed to occur and according to historian jl granatstein mulroney raised the militarys hopes repeatedly but failed to deliver in  he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to  troops but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below  by  this was however in step with other nato countries after the end of the cold war the mulroney government undertook a defence policy review publishing a new statement in late  but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the post cold war era was arrived at before the governments defeat in  according to granatstein this meant that canada was not able to live up to its postcold war military commitments the decline of cod stocks in atlantic canada led the mulroney government to impose a moratorium on the cod fishery there putting an end to a large portion of the newfoundland fishing industry and causing serious economic hardship the government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the atlantic provinces the environment was a key focus of mulroneys government as canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the un conference on the environment his government added significant new national parks bruce peninsula south moresby and grasslands and passed the canadian environmental assessment act and canadian environmental protection act retirement widespread public resentment of the goods and services tax an economic slump the fracturing of his political coalition and his lack of results regarding the quebec situation caused mulroneys popularity to decline considerably during his second term an ominous sign was a  byelection in the alberta riding of beaver river in this election called when tory mp john dahmer died before ever having a chance to attend a sitting reform party candidate deborah grey won by a hefty  votes after finishing fourth in the general election just five months earlier this was perhaps the first sign that mulroneys grand coalition was fracturing the pcs had dominated albertas federal politics since the  election another sign came before meech lake was finalized when bouchard resigned from both the cabinet and the party over changes to the proposal that he felt diluted its spirit after the failure of meech bouchard convinced several other tories to break with the party and join him to form the bloc québécois a prosovereigntist ie independentist party years later mulroney said that his biggest error as prime minister had been trusting his former university friend indeed he and bouchard have not spoken to each other in over two decades mulroney entered  facing a statutory general election under canadian law federal governments can have a maximum duration of five years but they often have lesser duration as they must enjoy the confidence of the house of commons in order to continue in office by this time his approval ratings had dipped into the teens and were at  in a  gallup poll making him one of the most unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in canada in the s there was a consensus that mulroney would be heavily defeated by jean chrétien and the liberals if he led the tories into the next election—ironically the same situation that led to trudeaus departure from the scene nine years earlier he announced his retirement from politics in february and was replaced as prime minister by defence minister kim campbell in june the last gallup poll taken before his retirement in february  showed his approval ratings had rebounded to  in his final days in office mulroney made several decisions that hampered the tory campaign later that year he took a lavish international farewell tour mostly at taxpayers expense without transacting any official business also by the time he handed power to campbell there were only twoandahalf months left in the tories fiveyear mandate further compounding the problem mulroney continued to live at  sussex drive for some time after campbell was sworn in as prime minister brian and mila mulroneys new private residence in montreal was undergoing renovations and they did not move out of  sussex until their new home was ready instead campbell took up residence at harrington lake the prime ministers official summer retreat across the river in gatineau park quebec the  election was a disaster for the tories the oldest party in canada was reduced from a majority with  seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level the seat loss far exceeded the seat loss the liberals suffered in  the tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the house of commons since the required minimum number of seats for official party status is  as an example of the antipathy toward mulroney his former riding fell to the bloc by a lopsided margin the tory candidate finished a distant third with only  votes—just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit in her memoirs time and chance and in her response in the national post to the secret mulroney tapes campbell said that mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the tories reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off campbell went as far as to claim that mulroney knew the tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election and wanted a scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity rather than a true successor airbusschreiber affair main article airbus affair in  mulroney settled a libel lawsuit he had brought against the government of canada two years previously mulroney received an apology and a  million reimbursement for legal and public relations costs at issue were allegations that mulroney had accepted bribes in the airbus affair concerning government contracts the government said the charges could not be substantiated the principal royal canadian mounted police rcmp investigator on the case retired a year later the government later dropped the investigation entirely but a key fact was unknown in  and had not been elicited under sworn testimony in which mulroney had denied business dealings or significant meetings with a business associate mulroney later confirmed that he had personally accepted cash payments from his business associate karlheinz schreiber a germancanadian businessman who had been a paid broker for airbus and other companies the cash changed hands in three secret meetings in hotels in montreal and new york city in brown paper bags of  bills totaling either  according to mulroney or  according to schrieber the payments occurred over an month period beginning in  when mulroney had stepped down as prime minister but was still a member of parliament in  mulroney stated that he had kept the cash paid in new york in a new york safe deposit box thus implying that he had not illegally carried it undeclared across the uscanada border and in a safe in his montreal home the cash payments had not then been declared as income for tax purposes schreiber had at his disposal  million from airbus for the payment of secret commissions cbc television reported on february   that the money schreiber paid to mulroney originated in a swiss bank account codenamed frankfurt schreiber used the same account to pay the secret airbus commissions schreiber transferred  from frankfurt to an account in zürich codenamed britan on july   and used these funds to make the three cash payments to mulroney in  and  five years after the payments began mulroney and schreiber met again in a suite at the hotel savoy in zurich switzerland schreiber claims mulroney tried to extract a promise schreiber would never reveal the payments schreiber also claims mulroneys attorneys later tried to induce him into perjury by asking that he sign an affidavit falsely stating that he had never paid any money to mulroney mulroney denies this and also denies schreibers claim that the payments totaled  testifying before the house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney said the cash payments were for lobbying foreign leaders to buy armored vehicles from thyssen industries a company schreiber represented mulroney said schreiber had paid him as a consultant for this task only in the context of the potential bear head project which had actually been canceled three years prior to his accepting payment mulroney said he never had a written contract made written reports or issued receipts for the cash payments mulroney said he had destroyed records related to the transactions and received the payments in cash mulroney denied any illegal wrongdoing he admitted to errors in judgment and apologized for the impropriety mulroney described the public revelation of his wrongdoing as a near death experience and said his family had suffered greatly for many years mulroney had not acknowledged receiving money from schreiber the payments were concealed in mulroneys  lawsuit against the government of canada mulroney falsely testified under oath that he never had any dealings with schreiber knew him only peripherally and they had a cup of coffee once or twice in his  book a secret trial former law professor william kaplan describes mulroneys testimony as evasive incomplete and misleading in his testimony schreiber made allegations that described a canadian party leader subverted and deposed by foreign interests of federal contracts being used to funnel money back to those interests of bidrigging and kickbacks mulroney and schreiber question each others truthfulness and credibility in his testimony to the canadian house of commons ethics committee on december   mulroney pointed out contradictory statements schreiber has made over the years including statements made under oath mulroney also stated that the work he had performed for his armstrading business associate schreiber was outofcountry rather than lobbying his own canadian government – such as lobbying the late president boris yeltsin that russia buy arms yet to be made in canada schreiber had been incarcerated in canada following his  arrest on a german warrant for tax evasion and is currently june  free on bail mulroney did not declare the income or pay taxes on it until years later when schreiber had come under criminal investigation in germany erik nielsen former deputy prime minister for mulroney stated disbelief in mulroneys account and denied his credibility i think there was a phrase that attached to brian years ago where he was known as lyin brian and for my own part i believe that theyre both in the same boat — schreiber and mulroney canadian prime minister stephen harper had called a public inquiry in november  and appointed future governor general david lloyd johnston as a special adviser to study the matter and prepare terms of reference for the inquiry johnston had once reported directly to mulroney during his term as prime minister johnston reported to harper on january   that he had found  significant questions which required further examination harper accepted the report and stated that a limited public inquiry process would begin once the house of commons ethics committee finished its work schreiber lost his fight against extradition to germany where he is at the center of a political bribery scandal that helped bring down a government and damaged the legacy of former chancellor helmut kohl he appeared before the house of commons ethics committee three times in late november and early december  and again in february  and will likely be called upon to testify at the future limited public inquiry mulroney appeared before the ethics committee on december   six weeks later his lawyers submitted a letter to paul szabo the ethics committee chairman indicating that their client would not appear again before the committee because of his unfair treatment on december  on february   two days before that scheduled appearance ctv news reported that mr mulroneys lawyer had reiterated mulroneys refusal to reappear before the committee after politics since leaving office mulroney has served as an international business consultant and remains a partner with the law firm ogilvy renault he currently sits on the board of directors of multiple corporations including barrick gold quebecor inc archer daniels midland trizechahn corp toronto cendant corp new york aol latin america inc new york and cognicase inc montreal he is a senior counselor to hicks muse tate  furst a global private equity fund in dallas chairman of forbes global new york and was a paid consultant and lobbyist for karlheinz schreiber beginning in  he is also chairman of various international advisory boards and councils for many international companies including power corp montreal bombardier montreal the china international trust and investment corp beijing jp morgan chase and co new york violy byorum and partners new york vsa communications partners new york independent newspapers dublin and general enterprise management services limited british virgin islands in  mulroney was accorded canadas highest civilian honour when he was made a companion of the order of canada at the funeral of ronald reagan with former soviet president mikhail gorbachev former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and former british prime minister margaret thatcher in  mulroney received the woodrow wilson award for public service from the woodrow wilson international center for scholars of the smithsonian institution at a ceremony in montreal the award was in recognition of his career in politics in january  mulroney delivered a keynote speech in washington dc celebrating the tenth anniversary of the north american free trade agreement in june  mulroney presented a eulogy for former us president ronald reagan during the latters state funeral mulroney and former british prime minister margaret thatcher were the first foreign dignitaries to eulogize at a funeral for an american president two years later at the request of prime minister stephen harper mulroney traveled to washington dc along with michael wilson canadas ambassador to the united states as canadas representatives at the state funeral of former president gerald ford in february  as part of a physical examination a ct scan revealed two small lumps in one of mulroneys lungs in his youth mulroney had been a heavy smoker his doctors performed a biopsy which ruled out cancer his surgery is sometimes cited as an example of the dangers of unnecessary testing he recovered well enough to tape a speech for the conservative party of canadas  policy convention in montreal in march though he could not attend in person he later developed pancreatitis and he remained in hospital for several weeks it was not until april  that his son ben mulroney announced he was recovering and would soon be releasedcitation needed on september   veteran writer and former mulroney confidant peter c newman released the secret mulroney tapes unguarded confessions of a prime minister based in large part on remarks from the former prime minister which newman had taped with mulroneys knowledge the book set off national controversy newman had been given unfettered access to mulroney for a thorough biography and claims mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers after the falling out mulroney began work on his autobiography without newmans help mulroney himself has declared that he showed poor judgement in making such unguarded statements but he says that he will have to live with it this led mulroney to respond at the annual press gallery dinner which is noted for comedic moments in ottawa october   the former prime minister appeared on tape and very formally acknowledged the various dignitaries and audience groups before delivering the shortest speech of the night peter newman go fuck yourself thank you ladies and gentlemen and good night thirteen years after leaving office mulroney was named the greenest prime minister in canadian history by a member panel at an event organized by corporate knights magazine in  mulroney became the chairman of quebecor and defused tensions resulting from the continuing influence of former president and ceo pierre karl péladeau current political affiliation mulroney joined the conservative party of canada following its creation in  by the merger of the progressive conservatives and the canadian alliance according to press reports his membership lapsed in  in early  mulroney called a highranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs although he denies this claim legacy mulroneys legacy is complicated and even emotional mulroney makes the case that his onceradical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments and regards this as vindication his deputy prime minister don mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as dragging canada kicking and screaming into the st century mulroneys legacy in canada is associated mostly with the  free trade agreement and the goods and services tax gst although the tories were reelected in  campaigning on free trade they won with only  of the popular vote compared to  of the vote which went to the liberals and the new democratic party who campaigned mostly against the agreement however when the liberals under jean chrétien came to office in  promising to renegotiate key parts of the agreement they continued the deal with only slight changes and signed the north american free trade agreement which expanded the free trade area to include mexico the visibility of the gst proved to be very unpopular the gst was created to help eliminate the evergrowing deficit and to replace the hidden manufacturers sales tax which mulroney argued was hurting business mulroneys usage of a rare constitutional clause to push the tax through prices not falling very much with the mst removed and the in your face nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public the succeeding liberal government of jean chrétien campaigned in  on a promise to eliminate the gst as per the red book but ultimately backed away from that promise this prompted two of their members sheila copps and john nunziata to resign or be expelled in protest mulroneys supporters argue that the gst helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable mulroneys intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years his government had flirted with  percent approval ratings in the early s when mulroneys honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media by canadians in general and by his political colleagues during the  election the progressive conservative party was reduced to just two seats which was seen as partially due to a backlash against mulroney as well as due to the fracturing of his grand coalition social conservatives found fault with mulroneys government in a variety of areas these include mulroneys opposition to capital punishment and an attempted compromise on abortion fiscal conservatives likewise didnt appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of big government programs and political patronage in the  election nearly all of the tories western support transferred into reform which replaced the pcs as the major rightwing force in canada the tories only won two seats west of quebec in the next decade and recovered only upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late s the canadian right was not reunited until they merged with reforms successor the canadian alliance in december  to form the new conservative party of canada mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger at a time when former pc leaders joe clark jean charest and kim campbell either opposed it or expressed ambivalence military historians norman hillmer and jl granatstein ranked mulroney eighth among canadas prime ministers in their  book prime ministers ranking canadas leaders on march   it was reported by various news outlets that a conservative official claimed mulroney was no longer a member of the party they claimed his membership expired in  and was not renewed additionally mulroney allegedly called a senior party official two months ago to ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease however a mulroney confidante speaking on condition of anonymity called the partys claims preposterous hes part of the history of this party you cant rewrite history if theyre worried about branding then shut the inquiry down theyre the ones who called the inquiry  memoir mulroney appears during an interview speaking about his memoirs mulroneys memoirs  was released on september   mulroney criticizes trudeau for avoiding military service in world war ii and favourably references sources that describe the young trudeau as holding antisemitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators tom axworthy a prominent liberal strategist responded that trudeau should be judged on his mature views historian and former mp and trudeau biographer john english said i dont think it does any good to do this kind of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations an earlier book expressing brian mulroneys own opinions and

is not west germany or japan its right here brian mulroney partner here right in politics madame you need two things friends but above all an enemy brian mulroney politics friends enemy you cannot name a canadian prime minister who has done as many significant things as i did because there are none brian mulroney name you done you cant be chasing  rabbits otherwise the public mind cannot follow you brian mulroney mind you follow whether the process proves to be kyoto or something else lets acknowledge the urgency of global warming brian mulroney process global warming we created the cabinet committee on the environment to review the environmental implications of all government initiatives i think what made us successful was the fact that it was a sustained approach we did something new every year brian mulroney environmental government trudeaus contribution was not to build canada but to destroy it and i had to come in and save it brian mulroney canada build contribution so that was reagans political problem as a rancher in california he was an environmentalist himself but the president of the united states doesnt control everything that happens in washington brian mulroney control political problem its my responsibility and entirely my fault of course i regret it its the kind of lockerroom conversation we all use but as prime minister i shouldnt have used it brian mulroney responsibility regret kind if your only objective is to be popular youre going to be popular but you will be known as the prime minister who achieved nothing brian mulroney you nothing will i would go to them and i would explain this is the price of going forward were going to move ahead in all these other areas were moving ahead in tax reform and gst we are moving ahead on trade but this will not be done at the cost of the environment brian mulroney moving price done for example the prime minister earlier this year talked about the importance of the arctic to our future hes right a hundred years from now the strength of canada is going to be coming from our resources in the arctic brian mulroney strength future canada first president reagan was not enthusiastic but i built up a relationship with him in other areas and then persuaded him that this was important to us and to me and that we had to at least be in the process of looking at this seriously brian mulroney relationship looking and look i was a big brassy guy who won and won big i did what i wanted brian mulroney look big guy you have to spend your political capital on great causes for your country brian mulroney great political you i am not denying anything i did not say brian mulroney i am say anything you accumulate political capital to spend it on noble causes for canada if youre afraid to spend your capital you shouldnt be there brian mulroney political you canada when i appointed the minister of the environment to major cabinet status the planning and priorities committee the signals that that sent through ottawa were major because thats what the bureaucracy understands brian mulroney planning priorities we decided that the environment was an integral part of our policies and the political thrust of our government we gave it the priority and we sustained it with the money required to make it happen brian mulroney money government political there are so many demands on your time on your resources and on the prestige of the government brian mulroney time government resources the conservatives over the years have done a great deal from sir john a to diefenbaker and others brian mulroney great done over once you articulate an agenda you have to follow it brian mulroney you follow agenda if everything is very important then nothing is important brian mulroney important nothing then i think the government has to reposition environment on top of their national and international priorities brian mulroney environmental government i can see now a vision emerging how canada is going to profit in the future from our arctic resources without destroying the environment on which it is all based brian mulroney future vision canada every cabinet minister gets a mission
