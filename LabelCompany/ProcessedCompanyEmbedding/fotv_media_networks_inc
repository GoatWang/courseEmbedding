assessment impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions

  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america certain accounting policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial positions and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying these policies management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on our historical operations our future business plans and projected financial results the terms of existing contracts observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate for information regarding the companys critical accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see note  to the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   included in our final prospectus dated august   contained in our registration statement on form s results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from these estimates on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including the following        the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets        fair value of our common stock used to determine compensation expense for the issuance of for services servicebased restricted stock awards assumptions used in determining the need for and amount of a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets and        film cost amortization we base our estimates on historical experience available market information appropriate valuation methodologies and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities    table of contents going concern we have experienced net losses and significant cash used in operating activities since our inception and as of june   had an accumulated deficit of approximately  million a net loss of approximately  million and net cash used in operating activities of approximately  million for the six months ended june   our management expects us to continue to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows for at least the next twelve months these conditions among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the condensed consolidated financial statements included this filing have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern this basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business a successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of positive cash flows adequate to support our cost structure as at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  million compared to  million at the beginning of the year during the six months ended june   we received approximately  million for the issuance of our series a convertible preferred stock and we received approximately  million from our majority shareholder for the issuance of our common stock goodwill goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred management has established the last day of its year end as the date of our annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the unit carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill if the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill impairment has occurred our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our longrange planning process we also make estimates of discount rates perpetuity growth assumptions market comparables and other factors intangible assets and film library costs film library costs include capitalizable production costs production overhead and cost of acquired film libraries and are stated at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization marketing distribution and general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred for acquired film libraries remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to ten years from the date of acquisition costs of film library are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs the company bases these fair value measurements on the companys assumptions about how market participants would price the asset at the balance sheet date which may be different than the amounts ultimately realized in future periods the amount by which the unamortized costs of film library exceed their estimated fair values is written off film library costs for projects that have been abandoned or have not been set for production within three years are generally written off management has determined that film library cost will be expensed using the straightline basis over an estimated period of  years impairment of longlived assets we evaluate impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired if our review indicates that the carrying value of an asset will not be recoverable based on a comparison of the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows the impairment will be measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value fair value will be determined based on quoted market values discounted cash flows or appraisals impairments of property and equipment are recorded in the statement of operations as part of depreciation expense as of december   and june   there were no impairment losses of longlived assets    table of contents revenue recognition we have six revenue streams advertisingsupported video streaming subscriber video on demand purchase and rental transactions affiliate revenues storefront and sponsorship revenue revenues are derived from video advertising impressions served monthly premium subscription packages and fees paid upon the purchase or rental of titles on demand we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured advertising supported video streaming revenues net of agency commissions are recognized in the period during which underlying advertisements are broadcast or published subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the membership period revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed to members that have not been recognized transactional vod revenues are recognized at the time payperview or video on demand transactions are made by viewers for each individual title purchased or rented business combinations we account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates the excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill to the extent the fair value of net assets acquired including other identifiable assets exceeds the purchase price a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations accounting for business combinations requires significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date including estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed and determination of the fair value of contractual obligations where applicable significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users and customers acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and inherently uncertain for the acquisition of business under common control we account for them as a business combination under a method similar to the poolingofinterest method poolingofinterest in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  the financial statements of the group shall report results of operations for the period in which the transfer occurs as though the transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests had occurred at the beginning of the period results of operations for that period will thus comprise those of the previously separate entities combined from the beginning of the period to the date the transfer is completed and those of the combined operations from that date to the end of the period    table of contents income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions specifically the uk significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by differences between our anticipated and the actual mix of earnings generated across different tax jurisdictions which have higher or lower statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between consolidated financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates we recognize in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination based on the technical merits of the position the company records a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the companys tax return to the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made to the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision the company did not incur or need to record any liability interest and penalties during the years ended december   and the six months ended june   we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income taxes against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of any tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations liquidity or capital expenditures seasonality our revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis such fluctuations are the result of a seasonal pattern that reflects variations in consumer purchasing habits when consumers buy internetconnected devices they tend to increase their viewership of digital media including general video streaming services our subscriber growth is generally greatest during the fourth and first quarters october through march and slowest during the second and third quarters may through august impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for three months

measurement of inventory in international financial reporting standards ifrs the board has amended some of the other guidance in topic  to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory however the board does not intend for those clarifications to result in any changes in practice other than the change in the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for inventory within the scope of this update there are no other substantive changes to the guidance on measurement of inventory for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the amendments in this update

compensationstock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  to provide guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of sharebased payments to employees the guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled thus eliminating additional paidin capital pools the guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employees shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting in addition the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis we are required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal  but have early adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as permitted there was no impact upon adoption of this guidance since the recognition of income tax effects of awards was not materially different than amounts that had previously been recorded in our financial statements and we currently use an estimated average forfeiture rate to compute stockbased compensation expense   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b under the exchange act and are not required to provide the information under this item   item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures our management with the participation of our chief executive officer ceo and principal financial and accounting officer pfao has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this form q based on this evaluation our ceo and pfao concluded that because of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de under the exchange act were not effective as of june   we did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements in addition there was inadequate segregation of duties due to the limitation on the number of our accounting personnel    table of contents we intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies however due to our size and nature
