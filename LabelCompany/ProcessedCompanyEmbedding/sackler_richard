apocryphally attributed to joseph stalin a single death is a tragedy but a million deaths is a statistic i’ve been pondering that line lately apropos the  deaths related to prescription opioid overdoses between  and  — a figure sure to rise when  data come out a study published last week by economists anne case and angus deaton argues opioid overdoses help explain rising death rates for whites without a college education in the st century when death rates for other demographic groups continue to fall prescription opioid overdose deaths were rare before the s suggesting the current wave could have been avoided and that one or more persons or institutions can and should be held accountable who exactly i don’t know but i know whose opinion on the subject i most want to hear dr richard s sackler’s sackler is the scion of one of the wealthiest families in the world whose collective assets shared among  people total  billion according to forbes magazine art museums and medical research institutions around the world bear the sackler name in recognition of the family’s philanthropy the washington post relevant to the opioid crisis however the source of the sacklers’ fortune is their privately held firm purdue pharma maker of oxycontin a potentially addictive painkiller that has earned an estimated  billion in revenue since it came on the market in  — an event many consider the trigger of the opioid epidemic purdue’s aggressive marketing tactics akin to those pioneered for other drugs by richard sackler’s uncle arthur sackler who died in  spurred oxycontin’s phenomenal sales growth around the turn of the st century they also got the company prosecuted by the justice department in  purdue pleaded guilty as a corporation to a felony related to false marketing of the pills and paid  million three top executives also accepted guilt and paid fines neither richard sackler nor any other family member faced charges evidence did not tie them to the misconduct according to the virginia us attorney in the case john l brownlee sackler was and apparently still is a key figure at purdue however he went into the family business in  and over the next  years rose to “a series of positions of increasing responsibility including direct management of both the research and development and the sales and marketing functions” according to his published résumé sackler became president of purdue in  then cochairman of the board in  today purdue’s corporate website announces it’s “learning from the past while focusing on the future” in  purdue reformulated oxycontin so it is much more difficult for those seeking a high to convert the pills into inhalable or injectable forms perhaps not just coincidentally oxycontin sales though substantial are declining the company is at work on new products such as a remedy for constipation caused by prolonged opioid use and recently provided a  million grant to virginia’s prescription drugmonitoring program still it’s hard to move on without some sort of public accounting unmediated by lawyers or corporate executives from the people who made so much money off these drugs the sacklers though are publicityshy aside from putting their names on buildings and endowed chairs a purdue spokesman declined my request for an interview with richard sackler or any member of the company’s board which includes his close relatives the closest thing to an accounting sackler has given may be his  sealed deposition in a lawsuit against purdue by the opioidravaged state of kentucky purdue settled out of court shortly after this sworn testimony for  million with no admission of wrongdoing now purdue’s lawyers are fighting a state judge’s subsequent order to release sackler’s deposition and other internal purdue records at the request of stat which covers health care news a kentucky appeals court could decide the matter soon perhaps sen claire mccaskill dmo will have better luck producing documents she has announced a wideranging investigation into the top five opioid manufacturers and their marketing practices to be sure continuing opioidrelated litigation against purdue and other pharmaceutical companies would discourage individual owners and executives from addressing the crisis candidly outside of court even if they wanted to this may be a drawback of how the american system holds businesses and others accountable also no investigation of the crisis would be complete without examining the role of all the gatekeepers — the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration state regulators and prescribing physicians — that were supposed to protect the public which brings us back to the cynical old saw if everyone is to blame is no one to blame where does
