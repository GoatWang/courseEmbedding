process multi asset strategies financial planners process our investment process is disciplined and transparent yet we retain the freedom to invest with conviction for each of our investment strategies we begin with a strategic asset allocation this acts as a reference point for our decision making to build the strategic allocations we analyse past and likely future performance from all major asset classes – equities bonds cash property private equity hedge funds and commodities in creating a strategic allocation we seek to achieve an optimal blend of these different assets this blend is broadly diversified and – if bought and held for the long term – should deliver the objective of the investment strategy the strategic asset allocation also reflects the amount of risk we are prepared to take in order to achieve the target returns tactical asset allocation while the strategic allocations provide a framework our portfolios will deviate substantially from these based on our assessment of the opportunities and risks across asset markets the degree of variation will depend on a number of factors but we set no maximum or minimum limits for each asset class it is the overall risk of the portfolio and the contributors to that risk that we monitor closely to ensure that each strategy is run in a manner consistent with its mandate  we also use our tactical allocation to introduce themes and ideas into our investment strategies these are designed to improve returns by capturing the opportunities we see in the markets over the coming  to  months well done is better than well said benjamin franklin portfolio construction when constructing portfolios we are focused on delivering the best value and returns for our clients and are constantly assessing options for their investment potential cost risk and tax effectiveness  often the most appropriate investment will vary greatly between asset classes regions markets and sectors – and over time we therefore invest in a range of vehicles including directlyheld securities passive funds active funds and derivative backed securities  team responsibilities  within the team individuals have responsibility for both portfolio management and investment research specialising in a particular asset class region or investment area  our approach to decision making is collegiate we are a closeknit team taking decisions together monitoring progress together and sharing responsibility for the results meet the team view biographies culture and history our culture investment insights read more the value of
