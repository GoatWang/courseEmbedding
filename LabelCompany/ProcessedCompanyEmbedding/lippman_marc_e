university of miami miami florida current research despite great strides in treatment for localized breast cancer metastatic breast cancer remains an overwhelmingly lethal disease most breast cancer research has focused on breast cancer cells themselves to identify mechanisms of disease progression the behavior and characteristics of noncancer cells of the breast either caused by the presence of breast cancer or influenced by preexisting risk factors such as obesity and depression contribute directly to breast cancer progression and malignant spread through support from bcrf dr lippman and his team have made progress toward identifying contributing hostenvironmental factors by developing models to study the role of specific genes in breast cancer metastasis the combination of a receptor called rage and its binding partner saa is overexpressed in breast cancer and dr lippmans group identified sa as a potential biomarker for risk of metastasis they designed a drug that targets rage and observed that this drug prevents breast cancer metastasis in experimental models they are now using sophisticated pharmacological and genetic methods to manipulate rage signaling in breast cancer cells in cancerassociated fibroblasts and in other noncancer cells of the tumor microenvironment they are also working to identify factors in addition to rage that are responsible for recruiting and activating myeloidderived suppressor cells which impair immune function allowing breast cancer cells to grow and divide they will determine if targeting these factors with a drug can block recruitmentactivation of myeloidderived suppressor cells and prevent breast cancer metastasis finally they are determining if rage is a critical factor that enables cancerassociated fibroblasts to drive metastasis of breast cancer cells these research efforts may yield actionable biomarkers and will lead to the development of novel weapons to add to the arsenal against breast cancer bio marc e

of medicine editorial on breast cancer study a new approach for monitoring metastatic breast cancer has “remarkable potential” according to marc lippman md the kathleen and stanley glaser professor of medicine and deputy director of the university of miami sylvester comprehensive cancer center in an editorial titled “circulating tumor dna – ready for prime time” and published march  in the new england journal of medicine lippman and coauthor kent osborne md of baylor college of medicine in houston note the significance of a united kingdom breast cancer study reported in the same issue “multiple aspects of the management of metastatic breast cancer need improvement” lippman says in the column “patients are anxious about their risk of recurrence and disappointed at the lack of reliable tests for early detection of recurrence” the uk study “analysis of circulating tumor dna to monitor metastatic breast cancer” by sarahjane dawson fracp phd department of oncology university of cambridge and  coauthors looked at cancer tumor cells circulating in  women with metastatic breast cancer who were receiving systemic therapy the researchers used genetic sequencing to identify dna alterations and were successful in detecting mutations in  of the  women in the editorial lippman said the study demonstrated that when mutations could be detected in a patient’s primary tumor and in the blood plasma the number of copies of circulating tumor dna was reasonably correlated with the patient’s responses to treatment in other words there was a significant relationship between the number of dna copies in blood and the ultimate prognosis of the patient however lippman noted that while mutations could be detected in nearly all study participants the specific structural variations could only be tracked in about  percent of the women therefore it may be difficult and costly to develop specific tests for individual patients “despite these concerns there is remarkable potential for this approach” lippman said in the editorial tests of circulating tumor dna might be able to identify patients who would not need further therapy or those with localized breast cancer who would be adequately treated by lumpectomy a partial breast removal circulating tumor dna tests might also be used to screen for recurrences in patients with previously diagnosed earlystage disease although this potential use has not been proven to improve patient outcomes “the new study provides proof of the concept that circulating tumor dna represents a sensitive biomarker of tumor burden” said lippman adding that “further studies are clearly warranted” boardcertified in hematologyoncology internal medicine and endocrinology diabetes and metabolism lippman is widely known for his research in breast cancer in his illustrious career he has received numerous awards including the mallinckrodt award of the clinical radioassay society in  the commendation medal usphs in  meritorius service

chapter  breast cancer marc e lippman  breast cancer is a malignant proliferation of epithelial cells lining the ducts or lobules of the breast in the year  about  cases of invasive breast cancer and  deaths will occur in the united states in addition about  men will be diagnosed with breast cancer epithelial malignancies of the breast are the most common cause of cancer in women excluding skin cancer accounting for about onethird of all cancer in women as a result of improved treatment and earlier detection mortality rate from breast cancer has begun to decrease very substantially in the united states this chapter will not consider rare malignancies presenting in the breast such as sarcomas and lymphomas but will focus on the epithelial cancers human breast cancer is a clonal disease a single transformed cell—the product of a series of somatic acquired or germline mutations—is eventually able to express full malignant potential thus breast cancer may exist for a long period as either a noninvasive disease or an invasive but nonmetastatic disease these facts have significant clinical ramifications  not more than  of human breast cancers can be linked directly to germline mutations several genes have been implicated in familial cases the lifraumeni syndrome is characterized by inherited mutations in the p tumorsuppressor gene which lead to an increased incidence of breast cancer osteogenic sarcomas and other malignancies inherited mutations in pten have also been reported in breast cancer  another tumorsuppressor gene brca has been identified at the chromosomal locus q this gene encodes a zinc finger protein and the product therefore may function as a transcription factor the gene appears to be involved in gene repair women who inherit a mutated allele of this gene from either parent have at least a – lifetime chance of developing breast cancer and about a  chance of developing ovarian cancer the risk is higher among women born after  presumably due to promotional effects of hormonal factors men who carry a mutant allele of the gene have an increased incidence of prostate cancer and breast cancer a fourth gene termed brca which has been localized to chromosome q is also associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer in men and women  germline mutations in brca and brca can be readily detected patients with these mutations can be counseled appropriately all women with strong family histories for breast cancer should be referred to genetic screening programs particularly women of ashkenazi jewish descent who have a high likelihood of a specific brca mutation substitution of adenine for guanine at position   even more important than the role these genes play in inherited forms of breast cancer may be their role in sporadic breast cancer a p mutation is present in nearly  of human breast cancers as an acquired defect acquired mutations in pten occur in about  of the cases brca mutation in sporadic primary breast
