narrative of reinvention  sandford borins sandford borins professor of public management he writes blogs and teaches about narrative and innovation reencountering lorne weil a narrative of reinvention last week i was reading walter keichel’s the lords of strategy a history of strategic management a field in which both academics and consultants have made important conceptual contributions early on there was a somewhat insidebaseball chapter about the development of the market growthindustry share matrix by the boston consulting group in the late sixties in that discussion i found this sentence “finally lorne weil a member of the team proposed a new display to capture what was going on” though keichel wanted his story to be accurate and complete one of the rules of writing narrative to avoid referring to a minor character only once and lorne weil was mentioned just this once if readers paid the name any attention at all they might have wondered if lorne was a relative of the famous sanford weill but when i read that sentence my neurons started firing i knew a lorne weil in high school i think he was president of students’ council a few years before me he was an excellent clarinetist and he performed rhapsody in blue and mozart’s clarinet concerto with the school orchestra and i vaguely remember sitting beside him on a flight between boston and toronto probably forty years ago and he was telling me about his job in management consulting i googled lorne weil confirmed my hunch and found out lots of other interesting stuff yes he started his career in management consulting with bcg he then moved to the technology sector focusing on wagering systems and from  to  was ceo of scientific games corporation sgms on the nasdaq which describes itself as a supplier of instant lottery tickets and systems online lottery systems and parimutuel wagering systems and terminals under lorne’s leadership sgc did very well increasing its revenues from  million to over a billion lorne also did very well the industry publication casino journal told us that his total compensation in  was  million of which   million was in stock on the personal side he lives in new york city and he’s on the board of overseers at columbia business school where he took his mba and has endowed an “outrageous business plan competition” he has a son luke whose behavior appears to be outrageous but in a different sense luke is discussed in a jan   feature article in new york magazine by jennifer senior entitled rich kid syndrome luke had a checkered academic career at brown and columbia business school and served jail time for assaulting a girlfriend finally lorne gave the maximum allowable donation to the  mccain presidential campaign what strikes me about lorne’s narrative is the theme of personal reinvention walter kiechel writes that “one can make a decent living as a senior partner at a major consulting firm – these days a productive type can earn upward of   or   million a year – but as a few of the breed complain privately it’s no way to become seriously wealthy” p  the problem is that consultants advise but they don’t manage so lorne went from being a consultant to the gaming industry to managing a firm in the gaming industry he was rewarded with equity in the company and he did become seriously wealthy the second reinvention involves crossing a national border quite a few ambitious canadians leave for the big apple or elsewhere in the us like it there and as michael ignatieff – to the detriment of his political career in canada – did start to refer to americans in the first person plural others names like dan aykroyd and frank gehry come to mind – retain some ties with canada it appears that lorne no longer has any canadian presence and sees america as his we the high school lorne and i attended vaughan road collegiate now vaughan road academy will be celebrating its eightyfifth year next spring when i attended vaughan was onethird jewish onethird italian onethird working class wasp and it was a great place to learn about what would later be referred to as toronto’s multiethnic reality but that’s another story i’d like to reencounter lorne again at the celebration but i’d be surprised if he makes it related posts  seconds of media attention for a vintage watch july  july  sandford watch great movies tell your story

may  sandford  comment i worked for lorne for a several years while he ran his own consulting firm in the early ’s before becoming ceo of autotote he is an amazing individual with an uncanny ability to understand and guide others in their creation of wealth clients loved him and his staff was truly devoted to him i would wager that most of his former employees would to this day be happy to be of service to him thanks to him i developed an appreciation of the finer things in life – good food good wine travel he not only earned substantially he spent freely he is a very demanding individual and

introduction  the gaming industry consumer markets and macroeconomic climate have moved out of a period of slowgrowth conservatism and into a period of exciting change and high expectations  the industry needs strong leadership to drive innovation and increase capital investment  lorne weil served as ceo of scientific games from  to  during which time revenues grew from just under  million to over  billion he returned to the ceo role in late  to guide the company and its customers toward achieving full growth potential   mr weil talks about the important trends that will drive that growth and how scientific games is positioning its business units to create new and exciting player experiences that truly optimize the revenue growth of their lottery customers paul jason public gaming how important is the us doj memorandum which empowers states to regulate igaming and idistribution of lottery products lorne weil scientific games is a big believer that regulation of gaming is a statelevel function in  stateregulated lotteries in the us generated  billion in funding for good causes future revenue will be seriously eroded if legal internet gaming is not regulated and taxed by the states state lottery contributions are in jeopardy if lotteries are forced to compete with federal internet gaming providers but are prohibited from offering their own games for sale on the internet after talking to our lottery customers we anticipate that some will be first to move to sell new games through new channels to their players some will offer an expanded internet experience that engages players with their current games others will wait and see what emerges  scientific games most definitely sees the internet as the next significant growth channel for the lottery industry it engages players in an experiential relationship with the lottery and its games  as you know paul because we’ve been discussing this for the last few years we call our solution sciplay the internet has been transformational for other industries  i evangelize its potential to be the same for our industry  how would you assess the potential of the internet to contribute to lotteries business l weil with  of the us population currently having access to or using the internet a new internetbased sales channel could definitely lead to expanded playership for lottery products by introducing new players to the games and by offering current players new interactive ways to play the lottery from their home computers laptops tablets and mobile devices certainly internet sales require examination by each individual state  but any time there is a new channel to market and promote lottery games to players it’s a good opportunity to increase sales performance and maximize returns to beneficiary programs  the internet should not be viewed a separate sales channel in isolation but as one component of a lottery’s entire sales and marketing mix for all games  both draw games and instant games lotteries must find ways to use the internet to increase not cannibalize overall sales a lottery’s internet platform must be customized so that it works in tandem with the existing brick and mortar retail network integration with traditional products and retail networks must be a crucial component of a lottery’s internet channel strategy as for potential since our propertiesplus™ program launched with the tennessee lottery in february this year the results have been phenomenal this program is clear indication of the value that can be realized when traditional products are integrated with an internet strategy  the lottery’s board of directors and rebecca hargrove the lottery’s president  ceo are incredibly engaged and excited about this new lottery initiative the tennessee lottery just had a phenomenal record month in february total sales were up  over last february with the launch of our propertiesplus™ program for internetbased player engagement and rewards this is solid proof that engaging players in a new way using the internet can build playership and increase sales how is scientific games positioning itself to help customersie lottery operators optimize performance going forward and to integrate the internet into their channel mix for optimal impact etc l weil its not how we are positioning but how we have already positioned ourselves over the last decade or so because we have been anticipating that this day would come since  scientific games has developed a strong leadership position helping our lottery customers outside the us with internet sales then taken this knowledge into the us and created meaningful internet programs for our lotteries here we have developed a portfolio of assets and internal company expertise through the strategic acquisitions of leading content firms gamelogic and barcrest and our creation of sciplay continues to be our focus very important to the unique internet gaming position we have here in the us is our launch of almost  micro sites in  us states along with our successful players club and loyalty rewards programs that have enhanced both player engagement and retail participation  sciplay brings the technologies and expertise together and integrates an internet program for us lotteries i have found myself making a distinction between “igaming and “idistribution” of traditional games  but i have not seen that others are making any such distinction  do you feel that there is a relevant distinction to be made between igaming which would include all forms of internet wagering games like ipoker casinostyle games and actually any igames other than traditional lottery games and idistribution of traditional games which would include all the varieties of secondchance draws instants and jackpot games and what i would like to think is a whole new portfolio of idistribution strategies and traditional lottery games customized for lottery distribution l weil for us the distinction is actually between ilottery and igaming because the internet is generally not purely a distribution channel for any consumer product the internet will always deliver a unique personal interactive experience it can also help build playership by establishing a “community” for players through players clubs and loyalty reward programs and of course social media ilottery – which is the sale of draw including subscriptions and electronic instant games – offers a very different player experience than igaming – which is bingo poker and other casinostyle games there is a big difference between buying an instant or draw game to play on the internet ilottery versus engaging in a casinostyle game play experience on the internet igaming the internet will be able to offer an expanded play experience that engages a lottery’s players with current games and it will also offer new channels through computers and laptops tablets mobile devices for the lottery to sell new interactive games to their players i have been quite outspoken though with the notion that this us doj position statement is a window of time that will close at some point this us doj opinion is fungible and can be overturned in congress or by the doj itself under guidance of the next administration  in fact big casino is spending tens of millions of dollars to affect just that result and given enough time will almost certainly succeed  do you agree with those suppositions andor how would you clarify or better explain the current position of state governments and their lotteries and what they should do about it l weil the government entity that regulates gaming is a local issue scientific games has always been a believer that states need to make this decision scientific games supports all lottery advocacy groups and we are working with naspl to support its efforts in this area us lotteries should proceed carefully but expediently to interpret the doj’s recent opinion as it applies to other federal laws as well as their own existing state laws because us lotteries work diligently to deliver revenue performance to the state governments they serve naturally they must view the internet as a very important growth opportunity – based on what’s happening in other areas of the world internet sales initiatives have generated significant growth for lotteries tell us about sciplay and scientific games strategies to support the efforts of us lotteries to leverage the internet for optimizing the gaming experience and integrate the internet into the channel mix l weil well i’ll begin by sharing some research we’ve done that may surprise you … of lottery players have access to or use the internet – that’s actually more than the general population and  of lottery players are age  or older – so we’re definitely not talking about creating a new channel that reaches the “younger demographic” – we’re talking about adding a sales and distribution channel that will reach a lottery’s existing loyal player base and grow playership as well as attract new players to the games again the internet must be integrated into the lottery’s overall strategy it cannot stand alone but must work in tandem with existing products and retail networks one of our key areas of focus has always been to customize offerings to meet the dynamics of each individual lottery jurisdiction and we approach internet and sciplay in the same way working with our us lottery customers we have already implemented successful loyalty rewards programs to help optimize the play experience and build playership loyalty rewards programs foster a more social or emotional relationship with players – so the internet becomes much more than simply an additional channel for sales transactions once this relationship is established it’s all about continuing to engage players and build loyalty with points for prizes® nd chance drawings and other promotions the opportunity to integrate these promotions with existing lottery retailers to drive traffic to brick and mortar locations is virtually unlimited when a lottery begins using the internet to sell products within its state responsible gaming will be of the utmost importance and because we have been anticipating this scientific games has expertise in place that will enable lotteries to launch an internet sales channel with age verification geolocation selfexclusion and fraud prevention technologies that regulate purchases through a secure sciplay platform as lotteries explore the possibility of offering their players electronic versions of instant scratch games scientific games can provide our customers the proven expertise of a content creation team that’s designed and programmed many of the bestselling traditional scratch games in the us the association of convenience stores nacs posted a statement proclaiming the negative impact that idistribution would have on landbased retail sales  the records of lotteries that have been distributing over the internet for years shows clearly that is not the case  how can we convince our retail channel partners to embrace the tremendous opportunity this represents for them to drive new consumer groups into their stores and affect all manner of new outreach that will benefit everyone including retailers  any thoughts on what sgmdi is doing in particular to make that happen l weil lotteries like other businesses make sales through marketing and distribution channels the most successful lotteries in the world – indeed the most successful businesses in the world – watch what their customers are doing help shape behaviors and ultimately adapt to the consumer’s choice   today consumers are choosing the internet in addition to traditional retail operations to make their purchases  virtually every consumer industry understands that both their existing customers and future customers are using the internet for news information shopping entertainment and staying connected – so it has now become mandatory to build internetbased sales channels or risk obsolescence by no means does selling lottery products on the internet require or result in shutting the store and moving exclusively to the internet  indeed successful businesses including pioneering lotteries have found that effective integration of the internet into the channel mix can increase not cannibalize a lottery’s overall sales in fact it can be used to drive traffic back to brick and mortar retailers  experiences from international jurisdictions that have pursued comprehensive internetbased sales have seen a corresponding growth in brick and mortar retail sales  simply put distribution over the internet can expand the opportunity for all stakeholders  this is an important approach that needs to be shared with the retail partners success happens through partnership and collaboration an important driver for a successful internet sales initiative is providing a wide range of methods for a consumer to fund the activity  in the world of itunes® a very successful example consumers can deposit funds into their account through numerous online sources eg credit card debit card bank account transfer etc  a consumer can also deposit funds by purchasing a prepaid card distributed through an extensive network of retail outlets  the same would be true for a lottery internet sales program  players could deposit funds through traditional internet means  but they could also do so through a visit to any lottery retail outlet  this connection is critical to making the internet and retail channels two parts of the same consumer connection promotions designed to drive sales growth will also target play at traditional retailers  for example last year zynga® – the world’s most successful social gaming website with over  million monthly active users – ran a promotion in conjunction with eleven®  slurpee® cups contained webcodes that awarded free bonuses in the popular zynga game farmville  consumer traffic to eleven peaked as farmville players took advantage of this promotion  lotteries selling games on the internet will offer continued promotions that tiein their retailers as a natural means to drive overall sales  it just makes sense  and the traditional retail base will benefit the connection to retail and launching marketing programs that bring players to the internet and back to retail are important elements of sciplay selling powerball and other draw games over the internet would seem to be a nobrainer  certainly a great way for lotteries to get started on the internet  but how about instant scratch games and other game concepts  i would think the instants category offers a fertile ground for innovating to create new and engaging games l weil as they explore the possibility of internet programs lotteries must make decisions that don’t limit their options maintaining flexibility for access to the best electronic instant game content is really important this is an area where canadian lotteries are making some strong decisions today to make sure they always have access to the best content portfolio and are not limited exclusively to the firm that delivers the infrastructure solution for selling internet ilottery games a west virginia legislator appears to be trying to stanch the growth of vlts there in wv  it concerns me that big casino is turning more and more big guns towards steering states away from igaming and now it seems they are attacking the vlt and distributed venue model l weil while we remain supportive of the west virginia lottery and the west virginia legislative team licensing and enforcement is not within the scope of scientific games’ relationships in west virginia or any of the other  vlt jurisdictions in the us what i can share is that the west virginia lottery manages nearly  vlts in over  bars and taverns and five racinos with nearly  vlts – including the state’s largest racino with over  vlts our aegisvideo™ system has been in operation there for over five years and utilizes a variety of gaming industry protocols which seamlessly interface with every licensed vlt manufacturer from the robust security of the games to financial accounting that balances to the penny our system has been very successful in this and other vlt jurisdictions congrats on the award of the illinois central server contract which is huge and represents the real heart of a distributedvenue system l weil we are very excited about illinois – it’s a big win illinois could grow to be the largest video gaming network in the country with the potential for up to  terminals our sixth generation aegisvideo central communication system will be implemented and managed by experienced scientific games staff from an operational center in chicago the scientific games video gaming group will provide realtime communication and control between every licensed video gaming terminal in the state of illinois as well as daytoday management of the operation of the system and service throughout the state this is truly a case of enhancing our product offering to meet a customer’s evolving and expanding needs globally scientific games’ video gaming group currently manages over  gaming machines in nearly  locations you served as ceo of scientific games from  to  during which time revenues grew from less than  million to over  billion  you returned to the ceo role in late  what are some of your observations on the lottery and gaming industry since youve been back at the helm and what do you see in the coming years as growth potential with regard to potential for lotteries and how has the global economic crisis changed the market and impacted innovation l weil im optimistic because were seeing innovation return on the investment side of the lottery business for years the lottery practice was to focus on the cost side of the business at the expense of real growth and return on investment a look at the reduced combined market capitalization of the major suppliers will confirm the impact of an outofbalance investment model more and more we are being directly engaged by government leaders – especially in the us – to enter into discussions and make recommendations as they look to fully optimize the performance of the lottery as a government asset with the integration of interactive channels publicprivate partnerships consortiums and focused execution in current channels innovation will once again fuel growth in our unique industry more and more lotteries are beginning to take an entrepreneurial focus – for example some of the strategic projects that have been initiated by the pennsylvania lottery overall i do find it very interesting to see a shift in the conversation over the last  months to a real focus on generating return on investment and realization that lotteries can provide a significant benefit when they receive adequate investment     world lottery website links world lottery website links
