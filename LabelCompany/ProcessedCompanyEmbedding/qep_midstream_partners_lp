prospectus based on an initial public offering price of  per common unit after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses we intend to use these proceeds as follows  make a cash distribution to qep of  million a portion of which will be used to reimburse qep for certain capital expenditures it incurred with respect to assets contributed to us  contribute  million to qep operating which will use those funds to repay all  million of its outstanding debt  pay revolving credit facility origination fees of  million and  pay wells fargo securities llc a structuring fee of  million as of march   qep operating our wholly owned subsidiary had approximately  million of debt outstanding comprised of intercompany loans from qep that bear interest at  and are due march   and  respectively qep operating assumed this intercompany debt in connection with this offering the outstanding indebtedness was incurred to primarily fund capital expenditures the net proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional common units will be used to redeem from qep a number of common units equal to the number of common units issued upon exercise of the option at a price per common unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit in this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts and the structuring fee accordingly any exercise of the underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all units the underwriters may from time to time engage in transactions with and perform services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business the oil and natural gas gathering business is very competitive our competitors include other midstream companies producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines competition for oil and natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation commercial terms reliability service levels flexibility access to markets location available capacity capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies our principal competitors are enterprise products partners lp western gas and the williams companies inc in addition to competing for oil and natural gas volumes we face competition for customer markets which is primarily based on the proximity of pipelines to the markets price and assurance of supply as a result of our contractual relationship with qep under our gathering agreements we believe that our gathering systems and other midstream assets will not face significant competition from other pipelines for qep’s crude oil natural gas or products transportation requirements  under our partnership agreement qep and its affiliates are expressly permitted to compete with us qep and any of its affiliates may acquire construct or dispose of additional gathering systems or other midstream assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct those assets company description we are a limited partnership recently formed by qep resources inc nyse qep to own operate acquire and develop midstream energy assets our primary assets consist of ownership interests in four gathering systems and two fercregulated pipelines through which we provide natural gas and crude oil gathering and transportation services our assets are located in or are within close proximity to the green river basin located in wyoming and colorado the uinta basin located in eastern utah and the portion of the williston basin located in north dakota as of and for the three months ended march   our gathering systems had  miles of pipeline and an average gross throughput of  million mmbtud of natural gas and  bblsd of crude oil we believe our customers are some of the largest natural gas producers in the rocky mountain region including qep anadarko petroleum corporation anadarko eog resources inc eog questar corporation questar and ultra resources inc ultra we provide all of our gathering services through feebased agreements the majority of which have annual inflation adjustment mechanisms for the three months ended march   approximately  of our revenues were generated pursuant to contracts with remaining terms in excess of seven years including  of our revenues that were generated pursuant to “lifeofreserves” contracts in addition to our feebased gathering services for the three months ended march   approximately  of our revenue was generated through the sale of condensate volumes that we collect on our gathering systems for the three months ended march   approximately  of our natural gas gathering volumes and approximately  of our crude oil volumes were comprised of production owned by qep making qep our largest customer we have secured significant acreage dedications from several of our largest customers including qep we believe that drilling activity on acreage dedicated to us should maintain or increase our existing throughput levels and offset the natural production declines of the wells currently connected to our gathering systems pursuant to the terms of those agreements our customers have dedicated all of the oil and natural gas production they own or control from i wells that are currently connected to our gathering systems and located within the acreage dedication and ii future wells that are drilled during the term of the applicable gathering contract and located within the dedicated acreage as our gathering systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect to additional wells we believe that one of our principal strengths is our relationship with qep qep is engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration and production ep activities as well as midstream activities related to its ep operations for the year ended december   qep reported  tcfe of total net proved reserves and total net production of  bcfe representing a  and a  increase respectively in proved reserves and production as compared to the year ended december   we believe this relationship will provide us with the opportunity to increase throughput volumes from qep production in areas where we have gathering systems to help facilitate the growth of its ep operations qep invested over  billion in midstream infrastructure from  through  following the completion of this offering and the transactions contemplated thereby qep will continue to own a substantial portfolio of other midstream assets qep intends for us to be the primary growth vehicle for its midstream business as a result we believe qep will offer us the opportunity to purchase additional midstream assets from it although it is under no obligation to offer to sell us additional assets and we do not
