— a great fortune even by st century standards all agree that the uncle has ensured the entire clan’s prosperity yet they insist he owes them more of the family fortunethe uncle disagrees he’s rose’s son ernest rady for generations the rady family has made money shared money fought over money the latest battle culminated in san diego superior court last month with seven of ernest rady’s nieces and nephews accusing him of “reneging” on a deal that would have netted each cousin tens of millions rady blasted them as ingrates noting they were all wealthy thanks to his guidance of the family’s company american assetson march  a jury unanimously ruled that rady owed nothing to his disgruntled relatives on march  rady and a larger family group — the original seven plaintiffs plus three others — privately settled a separate action over american assets’  million balancein san diego these courtroom dramas ran counter to rady’s image as a generous civic leader the yearold la jolla investor and his wife evelyn have made eightfigure donations to rady children’s hospital and uc san diego’s rady school of management why was he in the midst of this family implosion“whenever people say it’s not about money” said steven strauss one of rady’s lawyers “it’s about money” dollars though don’t tell the entire story these lawsuits opened a window onto one of north america’s wealthiest clans this family tree includes canadian horsetraders whiskeypeddlers who thrived in prohibitionera america and rady himself a gogetter who made a fortune in real estate car loans and banking before losing more

ekiel bronfman supported his large family by peddling fuel frozen fish and horses one of bronfman’s eight children sam noted that horse sales were often celebrated at a nearby tavern“the bar makes more profits than we do father” the boy noted according to “samuel bronfman” a  biography by michael r marrus “instead of selling horses we should be selling the drinks”in  sam bronfman bought joseph e seagram  sons during prohibition the company’s whiskeys — dewars calvert seven crown — were popular in us speakeasies bronfman always denied smuggling booze into the states not everyone is convinced in “last call” a  history of prohibition daniel okrent dryly noted that the spirits didn’t appear “through transubstantiation”charismatic and fiercely competitive sam looked out for his siblings — to a point proposing to divide the family’s spoils in  sam gave himself the largest amount of cash and seagram’s stockseveral siblings protested but sister rose came to sam’s defense “sam is being modest about his own share and generous to all of us”unequal shares were something of a family tradition in  rose used  million in seagram’s shares to establish a company to hold and invest her children’s money she gave each daughter  percent of the company her son ernest  percentafter a stroke felled rose’s husband max management of this company fell to yearold ernest through college law school and years as a manitoba barrister rady acted as the family’s chief financial officer he enjoyed spectacular results — especially after leaving the law and canada for san diego his first local investment in an el cajon apartment complex quickly earned a profit so did investments in office buildings and malls later he prospered in automobile finance and bankingearly in  forbes magazine named rady the world’s rd richest person american assets was worth  billionbig mistakessam bronfman the seagram’s tycoon died in  some of his progeny would squander fortunes on high living messy divorces misguided business ventures perhaps the low point came in  when a grandson allegedly plotted his own kidnapping to pocket a  million “ransom”rose rady’s offspring though lived quietly — although a dearth of scandals did not mean a shortage of money on frequent trips to canada rady huddled with family members to discuss american assets and other investment opportunitiesalthough wealthy thanks to american assets niece carol mcarton declined one of those other offers soon afterward rady cornered her at a family party to inform her that she had made a mistake“i opened my mouth to tell him what went into my decision” mcarton recalled “he turned on his heel and walked away he felt i should have invested that money and i didn’t do it and i was stupid”but another niece enjoyed a playful relationship with rady “i called him uncle furnace because he was full of hot air” said dr gail wagner now a hematologistoncologist in the bay area “and i was gail the pail because i was all wet”in september  rady informed wagner and her cousins that he was thinking about buying out american assets’s shareholders he wouldn’t live forever he noted just seven months after his brotherinlaw’s death and his harrowing encounter with an armed burglar he laid out what each person would receiveat thencurrent market values the amounts ranged from  million to  million each from kenya where wagner runs a clinic she emailed “thanks for the generous offer”but as rady’s lawyers successfully argued in court this was no “offer” just something rady was considering something that became impossible as the recession struckby mid american assets had lost more than  billion as the largest shareholder rady took the biggest hit “i remember going to an atm that rejected my card” he said “i was struggling to survive — it was the most difficult time of my life”he appeared in another forbes article the headline “america’s biggest billionaire losers of ”despite these losses rady was still wealthy but he was soon besieged from another quarter in october  wagner and a nephew dan blankstein sued uncle ernest by late  five more relatives joined in their lawyers included gail’s husband arne wagnerin court family ties seemed to have totally unraveled“your sister mindel” said arne wagner crossexamining rady “is about ”“well she’s your motherinlaw” rady shot back “i think you’d know she’s ”what do you thinkshare your thoughts in the comments belowwhen the trials’ first phase ended nieces and nephews flew home to winnipeg vancouver oakland“it’s still incredibly painful to me” gail wagner said “to lose him to lose that branch of the family has been horrible”her “uncle furnace” had similar thoughts “even though i won the case i feel like i lost i lost my family” copyright   the san diego uniontribune
