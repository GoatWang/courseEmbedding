technology achieves pci certification tablesafe payatthetable technology achieves pci certification fshare tweet  kirkland wash – july   – tablesafe inc innovators of the rail™ payatthetable platform today announced that their rail  payment system has achieved pci pts certification  the certification validates the rail  payment platform complies with the industry’s highest standards of security data integrity and privacy protection for processing electronic payments  the certification also clears the path for tablesafe to initiate manufacturing to fulfill the backlog of market demand for this highly anticipated product developed by the founding payment brands of the pci security standards council the pci pts is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management policies procedures network architecture software design and hardware manufacturing  the pci certification ensures that a product conforms to payment card data theft protections standards mandated by the pci security standards council  “with the surging risk of credit card fraud and chargebacks many fullservice restaurants are looking to provide increased protection for their customers’ card data and their establishment” said steve mckean president of tablesafe “the rail  is one of the elite few restaurantfocused pts certified payment platforms in the us helping to guard customers and restaurants from consumer fraud” the rail is housed inside a patented billfold replicating the traditional folio a restaurant uses to deliver the guest’s check  incorporating the latest payment technology the rail is designed to accept both current and future payment methods including traditional mag stripe emv chip and signature and chip and pin nfc apple pay android pay qrupc code and credit card companies’ mobile payment applications  this payment agnostic system will allow guests the ability to securely selfinsert or selfswipe credit debit or chipenabled cards or pay with their phone while keeping their credit card and identity securely under their control  it also allows the guest to autocalculate the tip split the bill multiple ways paybyitem and receive email receipts  “a restaurant depends on delivering the highest level of customer service and brand experience to drive their business so unlike most of the payment devices in the market today we designed the rail to complement the dining experience rather than disrupt it” said mckean  “the rail system provides the guest with the highest level of security freedom of payment choice and the ability to control the length of time to complete the payment process” in addition to providing pci compliance pointtopoint encryption and other security features the tablesafe system also provides restauranteurs with operational benefits such as improved staff efficiency quicker table turn and greater customer satisfaction  resulting in increased revenue    tablesafe will begin distributing the rail  payment system in multiple local seattlearea restaurants this summer and initiate a national pilot program with strategic customers in the fall   for more information on tablesafe and its
