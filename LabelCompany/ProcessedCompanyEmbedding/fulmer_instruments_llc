datespracticingnote reading practicelisteningth gradeth gradeth gradekarate stringsbow warmupsorchestra linkssitemap supplies what do i need for orchestra classfms orchestra supplies i know it can be so confusing and expensive to try to find supplies for stringed instrumentsespecially if you are like most people and dont know anything about these instruments   i have assembled some information below and have included some links to where you may order these at a discount over the prices in our local music stores  please read size information correctly especially as it pertains to shoulder rests  if you have a question about the size of your childs instrument please feel free to contact mei will be happy to help you  you can also look inside the instrument through one of the holes on the front shaped like the letter f  you will see the id tag with the makers name the date and often times a size indication inside  again if you have any questions about anything supplyrelated please let me know and i will be happy to help you  instruments  first of all let me say just a few brief words about buying instruments  one of the scariest days of my teaching career came about when i saw violins for sale on one of the end caps in target  i know that we all want to find bargains but i would just like to say that where musical instruments are concerned you really get what you pay for  i have seen so many wellmeaning people lose so much money on cheap instruments they find on ebay or at department stores  we call these vsosviolin shaped objects these instruments are seldom constructed well and set the student up for failure with an instrument that just doesnt hold up well to even the most careful use  click here to read further about how to avoid the dreaded vso  as my grandma always told me if it looks too good to be true it probably is  some great student model instruments that are tried and true are glaesel scherl and roth and knilling  you can find these for sale in the paper and in local music shops in the area  you can find really great deals on used instruments as well  i am always happy to help you with your decision before you ever spend any money  please understand that while colored instruments and bows are great for flashy solo performances they are not permitted for use in our school orchestra please contact me when you are ready to make an instrument purchase and i will be glad to help steer you in the right direction books     essential elements   this year we will be using the essential elements  books  th grade will need book  orange trim th grade book  purple trim and th grade students will need book  green trim it is actually more cost effective to get a book from one of our local music stores as they do not charge shipping there are plenty of books waiting at musician supply palmetto strings or star music  please be sure to double check that you have the correct book for the instrument your child plays  the name of the instrument appears on the upper right hand corner of cover of the book  rosin   rosin is used on the bows to help them make sound  it usually comes in a small square or rectangular box and is very fragile  chances are all students would appreciate a nice new cake of rosin  it is pretty inexpensive less than  and can best be purchased in a local music store  a little more expensive but really fun is rockin rosin this rosin is made in specialty shapes that the kids love but costs a little morearound  each  it might be nice for a gift or special occasion  instrument polish    stringed instruments require a special kind of polish for the wood and varnish  instruments should be polished about once a month to keep them looking nice please dont be tempted to use furniture polish on a stringed instrument  you can purchase instrument polish in the local stores as well and should be under shoulder rest   shoulder rests are a must for violin and viola players especially as we work on advanced concepts this year that require perfect posture  i recommend the kun shoulder pad pictured above as it is built well and holds up well to the abuse of a sixth grader  you can often find these much cheaper online  here is a link for you  please be careful to enter the correct instrument size in the drop down menu on the page  httpwwwswstringscomproductaccessoriesviolagpc  and  full sized violins  and  inch violas use  violin shoulder rests inch and larger violas will use a special viola shoulder rest also available in the drop down menu on the above page  extra hint  shoulder rests do not fit in most instrument cases  it is good to have a shoulder rest case that clips to the exterior of the instrument case to hold the shoulder rest since bookbags  may be detrimental to a shoulder rest  many of my students used pencil pouches or you can find one in several different colors in the local music stores for about   here is also a link to one that is a little less expensive online  httpwwwswstringscomproductaccessoriesviolagpezptuner    the students will be learning how to tune their instruments this year in orchestra class  we will be using the korg tuners similar to the one in the picture above  i know that many students have smart phones and tablets that will have apps that can do a fine job of tuning instruments  most of these tuner apps are even free however if you would like to purchase one of the korg tuners here is a link to the tuner on amazon  httpwwwamazoncomkorgcachromatictunerdpbpmhavsrefsrieutfqidsrkeywordskorgtunermetronome    metronomes are used a great deal in music to practice to a steady beat  we frequently use a metronome in class and i encourage the students to practice at home with a metronome as well  there is a free one for use online that can be found at httpwwwmetronomeonlinecom  if you would like to purchase an inexpensive one online here is a good link for you httpwwwamazoncomwittnermtquartzmetronomedpbeymgrefsrieutfqidsrkeywordsmetronome  music stand   music stands are a must for good practice at home  they promote good posture while practicing and will be used in concerts for years to come  this is a staple that all music students should have  i am providing a link to a very inexpensive model but there are many varieties depending on how much money you wish to spend  here is my recommendation httpwwwswstringscomproductaccessoriesallgpkbextra strings   having an extra set of strings available is such a convenience  if a string breaks in class and a student has an extra on hand i can replace the string in about a minute and the student loses no class time  much money can be saved by purchasing a set online as opposed to running out to the local music store and buying one emergency string at a time  its like having a spare tire when you need it  i recommend the daddario prelude strings for this agethey are strong strings priced fairly and hold up well  here are some links by instrument check sizes carefully  we use ball end stringsno loop end  you can buy individual strings but you save money on the setsthey are sold at the bottom of the drop down list that appears on the web pageviolin  httpwwwswstringscomproductstringsviolingpjsviola httpwwwswstringscomproductstringsviolagpjscello
