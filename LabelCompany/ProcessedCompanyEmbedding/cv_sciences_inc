sciences responds to cannabidiol fda cv sciences responds to cannabidiol fda warnings february   at  pm exclusive article by alan brochstein cfa      earlier today the food  drug administration fda posted  warning letters issued to marketers of products containing cannabidiol cbd  two of the companies receiving the letters were criticized for claims they made about products manufactured by cv sciences formerly cannavest otc canv  stuart tomc vice president of human nutrition responded to the news saying  “cv sciences did not receive a warning letter from the fda and never has” the company strongly condemns distributors of its products making health claims “fda routinely sends out warning letters for drug claims however this issue originated from an fda q and a online post about marijuana not dietary supplements notwithstanding the fda’s qa posting it is our opinion which is broadly shared by the marketplace that cbd has been marketed as a dietary supplement prior to commencement and public notice of any substantial clinical investigations instituted on cbd thereby rendering the ind preclusion inapplicable” said tomc the fda first raised issues about marketing cbd products when it published fda and marijuana questions and answers last year with an update on september th  the memo included  questions but the applicable ones to this discussion were these  can products that contain cannabidiol be sold as dietary supplements a no based on available evidence fda has concluded that cannabidiol products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section ffbii of the fdc act under that provision if a substance such as cannabidiol has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement there is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized however based on available evidence fda has concluded that this is not the case for cannabidiol for more information on this provision including an explanation of the phrase “marketed as” see draft guidance for industry dietary supplements new dietary ingredient notifications and related issues fda is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that cannabidiol products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section ffbii of the fdc act interested parties may present the agency with any evidence that they think has bearing on this issue  how did the fda determine that cannabidiol products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition based on available evidence fda has concluded that cannabidiol products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section ffbii of the fdc act under that provision if an article such as cannabidiol has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement there is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized however based on available evidence fda has concluded that this is not the case for cannabidiol the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding cannabidiol has been made public for example two such substantial clinical investigations include gw pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding sativex and epidiolex see sativex commences us phase iiiii clinical trial in cancer pain and gw pharmaceuticals receives investigational new drug ind from fda for phase  clinical trial of epidiolex in the treatment of dravet syndrome fda considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an investigational new drug application ind that has gone into effect under fda’s regulations  cfr  unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation an ind is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section  of the fdc act  will fda take enforcement action regarding cannabidiol products that are marketed as dietary supplements a when a product is in violation of the fdc act fda considers many factors in deciding whether or not to initiate an enforcement action those factors include among other things agency resources and the threat to the public health fda also may consult with its federal and state partners in making decisions about whether to initiate a federal enforcement action below is cv sciences official response to the fda qa in response to a question and answer page “qa posting” posted in midmay  on the us food and drug administration’s “fda” website relating to marijuana products cv sciences firmly believes that hempderived cannabidiol “cbd” falls under the definition of a dietary supplement according to dietary supplement health and education act   in our opinion cbd meets the definition of a supplement as it is an extract of a botanical and for its use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake the qa posting comments that cbd cannot be sold as a dietary supplement based on “available evidence” gathered by the fda  the “available evidence” was not made public by the fda  based on the fda’s nonpublic evaluation they concluded that cbd is subject to the investigational new drug “ind” preclusion regulations under the federal food drug and cosmetic “fdc” act the ind preclusion includes several requirements that must render true for a certain ingredient to be precluded from the definition of dietary supplement first the article must be authorized by the fda for investigation of a new drug  next substantial clinical investigations must be instituted  third the existence of such substantial clinical investigations must be made public  lastly all of the above must have occurred prior to marketing the substance as a dietary supplement or food  from our investigations all requirements to consider cbd under the ind preclusion regulations have not been adequately conducted thus furthering our opinion that cbd is not precluded from the definition of “dietary supplement” under section  ffbii of the fdc act furthermore the ind preclusion isn’t a new conversation with dietary supplements  in fact red yeast rice transresveratrol pp nac and dhea have been subject to the same scrutiny and continue to be sold as dietary supplements it is important to note that statements published on the fda’s website may be considered one of the following position guideline or policy  the qa posting is not official action by the fda it is simply a position within a subsector to a much larger conversation the nature of the position on cbd was published under the umbrella of marijuana questions and answers subsequently inviting solicitation and confusion from the industry this may be considered prejudicial based on the controversial nature of the issue marijuana cannabis vs hemp cannabis at hand based on global demand for hempderived cbd a compromise will eventually be reached with artisanal hemp extracts sold in coexistence with pharmaceuticals as is the case with prescription omega fish oils and commercially available omega offerings in fact cv sciences has committed itself to pursuing both  hempderived cbd for use in a wide range of consumer products including nutritional supplements specialty foods and beauty products and  proprietary therapeutics using cbd as the active pharmaceutical ingredient across multiple medical indications our development pipeline currently includes two preclinical programs notwithstanding the fda’s qa posting it is our opinion which is broadly shared by the marketplace that cbd has been marketed as a dietary supplement prior to commencement and public notice of any substantial clinical investigations instituted on cbd as the investigations that were publicized were not substantial due to being limited in number and preliminary in nature thereby rendering the ind preclusion inapplicable before this cannabis stock news is here its published to subscribers on  investor exclusive article by alan brochstein cfa based in houston alan
