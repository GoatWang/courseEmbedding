right to focus our investment strategy to include selfstorage properties  this is particularly true because the sector is less reactive to the typical market swings that have impacted core asset classes during economic cycles moreover the storage space has strong fundamentals but is a very fragmented asset class with a lack of institutional ownership thus we are deploying a consolidation strategy of predominantly class a product we are excited by the opportunities we have seen in the market thus far and look forward to deploying more capital in this space chcres general selfstorage investment strategy is to acquire newer vintage properties or form joint ventures to develop class a storage properties specifically chcre will target welllocated properties that provide an opportunity for operational improvement expansion of the existing property or the repurposing of existing buildings and development sites where fundamentals warrant new product  about crow holdings
