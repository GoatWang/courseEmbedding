embarrassment to the agency the department of justice and my position of director” reads an internal email lappin sent to members of the bop staff on tuesday “i was arrested for driving under the influence i immediately notified my supervisor as all of us are required to do and the matter will proceed through the courts” but even though the two announcements were made within a week of each other bureau of prisons spokesperson traci billingsley says lappin made plans to retire long before his recent arrest “he had plans to retire in spring 0 before the incident occurred” billingsley said lappin has worked at the bureau of prisons since  and has been bop director since  according to whorunsgov in a statement released last week announcing lappin’s retirement attorney general eric holder said lappin “has lent his invaluable insights and expertise to address prison overcrowding and expand prisoner development and rehabilitation programs he has worked tirelessly to provide people who

message from the director topic personal matter march  0 harley g lappin director bureau of prisons during my tenure as director i have enjoyed communicating with you through these messages to staff on a variety of important issues today the information is personal and especially difficult to share nevertheless i appreciate the opportunity to address you directly i recently allowed a lapse in my judgment to occur giving rise to potential embarrassment to the agency the department of justice and my position of director i was arrested for driving under the influence i immediately notified my supervisor as all of us are required to do and the matter will proceed through the courts as i have said over the years our behavior as staff extends beyond the confines of our work because our affiliation with the bureau of prisons remains with us regardless of where we are or what we are doing and as law enforcement officers we have a particular responsibility to respect the rule of law it is with great humility that i offer my most sincere apology to each and every one of you for failing to lead by example i extend my sincere gratitude to all of you for the support you have shown me during my tenure as director and i am confident that through you the agency will continue to do great things in the years ahead i hope to thank many of you personally prior to my retirement on may  0
