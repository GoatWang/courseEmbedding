fourteenyearold son josiah j k who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice one of the first medicines that lilly began to produce was quinine a drug used to treat malaria the result

company to its new headquarters in indianapoliss southside industrial area lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production lilly committed himself to producing highquality prescription drugs in contrast to the common and often ineffective patent medicines from its facilities in indianapolis the company manufactured and sold ethical drugs for use by the medical profession lillys medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients lillys first innovation was gelatincoating for pills and capsules the company’s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills which made the medicines easier to swallow in  lilly formally incorporated the business as eli lilly and company elected a board of directors and issued stock to family members and close associates colonel lillys only son josiah j k a pharmaceutical chemist graduated from the philadelphia college of pharmacy in  and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college j k became company president in  in  the company contracted to mix and sell succus alteran its first widely successful product and one its best sellers the product was marketed as a blood purifier and as a treatment for syphilis some types of rheumatism and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis sales from this product provided funds for lilly to expand its manufacturing and research facilities by the late s colonel lilly was one of the indianapolis areas leading businessmen whose company had more than onehundred employees and had   in  chained dollars in annual sales as the lilly company grew other businesses set up operations near the plant on indianapoliss near south side the area developed into one of the citys major business and industrial hubs lillys production manufacturing research and administrative operations in indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteenblock area as well as production plants along kentucky avenue an assortment of lillys throat lozenges from a  sales book around  colonel lilly turned over the daytoday management of the business to his son j k who ran the company for thirtyfour years although the s were a tumultuous decade economically the company flourished and came out stronger than ever in  lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used

created tens of millions of capsules and pills until the turn of the century lilly operated in indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did—manufacturing and selling sugarcoated pills fluid extracts elixirs and syrups the company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand one historian noted although the indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs that the patent medicine men of the era the company remained ambivalent about scientific research in addition to colonel lilly his brother james and son josiah j k the growing company employed other lilly family colonel lillys cousin evan lilly was hired as a bookkeeper as young boys lillys grandsons eli and josiah jr joe ran errands and performed other odd jobs eli and joe joined the family business after college eventually each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board josiah j k colonel lillys son and eli and joes father inherited

among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules which provided a more exact dosage lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others a  scientific american article claimed the lilly operation in indianapolis was the largest capsule factory in the world and was capable of producing  million capsules a day one of lillys innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugarcoated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors eli lilly grandson of the company founder introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in  this process which created multiples copies of a drug formula helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors in the s eli introduced the new concept of straightline production where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end in the company’s manufacturing process under eli’s supervision the design for building  a new floor plant that opened in indianapolis in  implemented the straightline concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs one historian noted it was probably the most sophisticated production system in the american pharmaceutical industry this more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell lillys regular workforce produced lesscostly medicines in offpeak times using the same manufacturing facilities during the s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success in  josiah hired biochemist george henry alexander clowes as director of biochemical research in  three university of toronto scientists j j r macleod frederick g banting and
