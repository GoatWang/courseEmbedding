category energy limited partnership morningstar risk average profile name of issuer legg mason expenses  the funds investment objective is to provide longterm investors a high level of total return with an emphasis on cash distributions under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its managed assets in securities of mlps in the energy sector for purposes of the  policy the fund considers investments in mlps to include investments that offer economic exposure to public and private mlps in the form of equity securities of mlps securities of entities holding primarily general partner or managing member interests in mlps indirect interests in mlps such as ishares and debt securities of mlps the fund considers an entity to be within the energy sector if it derives at least  of its revenues from the business of exploring developing producing gathering transporting processing storing refining distributing mining or marketing natural gas natural gas liquids including propane crude oil refined petroleum products or coal currently and as the fund makes its initial investments the fund intends to focus its investments in mlps with operations in crude oil natural gas liquids and refined products infrastructure this reflects clearbridges current belief that the combination of structurally higher global oil prices and the increased supply of domestic oil and natural gas liquids  due primarily to recent shale gas discoveries  makes mlps focused on these liquid products well positioned for long term growth while clearbridge currently anticipates that liquid productrelated infrastructure mlps will be the funds primary focus the dynamic nature of the energy markets may create new and potentially more attractive opportunities over time should macro energy political regulatory or tax considerations evolve and other types of mlps become more attractive clearbridge may look to invest in these new opportunities in addition changes in energy markets or related adverse political regulatory or tax developments could cause these beliefs and expectations to not be realized for as long as energy mlp opportunity is in the name of the fund the fund will invest at least  of its managed assets in the mlps in the energy sector the fund may not change its policy to invest at least  of its managed assets in mlps in the energy sector unless it provides stockholders with at least  days written notice of such change the fund may invest up to  of its managed assets in securities of issuers that are not mlps this  allocation may be in any of the securities described in this prospectus and the sai including securities of nonmlp companies engaged primarily in the energy sector such issuers may be treated as corporations for united states federal income tax purposes and therefore may not offer the tax benefits of investing in mlps leggmasoncom inception  adchoices adchoices markets dow dow ▲    last updated time   pm edt markets nasdaq
