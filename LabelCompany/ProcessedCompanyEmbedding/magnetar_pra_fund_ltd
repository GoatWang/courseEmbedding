of books starting in  in her 0 book structured finance and collateralized debt obligations nd ed she specifically mentioned magnetar capitals constellation cdos in the chapter on the credit crunch and cdos she described the deals as classic long equity short mezzanine a type of deal whose moral hazards she explored elsewhere in the book in addition she wrote constellation cdos seemed designed to fail and were largely synthetic in her diagram of the capital structure she noted that the monoline insurers were major investors elsewhere in the book she predicted the monolines would have huge losses related to cdos and time proved her correct  she also noted that excess interest is sometimes paid to the equity investor creating a conflict of interest a theme that would be central to subsequent media stories propublica  npr  this american life reportedit in 0 this american life of chicago public radio broadcast a radio show on magnetar capitals cdo strategy the report was by alex blumberg of the npr planet money project the report consisted largely of blumbergs interviews with jesse eisinger and jake bernstein of propublica whom blumberg had commissioned to research possible financial misdeeds related to the subprime housing bubble eisinger and bernstein interviewed dozens of people who had worked in the industry and many who were directly involved in magnetar capital deals0 eisinger and bernstein won the pulitzer prize of  for their series on the cdo industry it was the first pulitzer for work published only on the web propublicas written story came out on their website in april 0 coinciding with the radio show it alleged that the companys trades in the cdo market helped worsen the financial crisis of 0–0 by helping to structure cdos it was planning to short bet against0 the story essentially claimed that magnetar capital sponsored mortgagebacked collateralized debt obligations by agreeing to buy the worst tranche portion of the cdo the equity tranche since very few wanted to invest in the risky equity tranche those few that did were called sponsors without them the cdo would never get created the propublica stories claimed that magnetar capital then shorted bet against the better tranches of those and similar cdos by buying credit default swaps that insured them when the middle tranches of the cdos failed magnetar capital made back many times its initial investment in the equity tranche by receiving the insurance payoff the report also claimed that magnetar capital tried to influence the managers of the cdos it was instrumental in creating to buy certain risky bonds that would increase the risk of those cdos failing it also claims that magnetar capital cdos defaulted at a significantly higher rate than similar cdos this may reflect magnetar capitals superior performance in identifying which of the highquality tranches were most overpriced they also claim that the cdo market would have cooled off in late 0 if magnetar capital had not entered the market and that this would have resulted in the financial crisis being less severe magnetar capitals responseedit magnetar capital disputed the story many of its responses were explained in propublicas story and in a detailed letter magnetar capital sent to propublica posted on propublicas website magnetar capital said among other things that it was not betting it was hedging that most of its hedges were against nonmagnetarcapital cdos and that it was not making cdos that were built to fail on purpose it also claimed that its strategy was not based on a downturn in the housing market that is it did not bet that mortgagebacked cdos would default it detailed many of its objections in a letter and list of responses to propublica which are linked to on propublicas website magnetar capital stated to investors that it never sought to bet on the decline of the subprimemortgage market rather the firm states it had no embedded view regarding the direction of housing prices the rate of mortgage defaults or the subprime mortgage market generally instead magnetar capital claimed it sought to profit from arbitrage its perception that the riskiest highyield tranches of cdos were underpriced relative to the lessrisky lowyield tranches the firm expected to make a profit when either the overpriced securities declined or when the underpriced securities appreciated with the collapse of the subprime market magnetar capital lost money on the risky tranches but made a net profit because the overpriced tranches declined even further magnetar capital rejected the idea that it had picked securities purposely so that they would fail the theorycitation needed is that magnetar capital was essentially betting that the likelihood of multiple defaults on the underlying loans was more likely than was reflected in the price of the higher tranches the high prices of the highquality tranches reflected the assumption that any defaults would be localized and unrelated so that it was unlikely that much of the portfolio would default at once magnetar capital was betting that in all likelihood if the equity tranch lost its value the rest of the cdo would lose value as well because many defaults were likely to happen together this is what in fact happenedcitation needed magnetar capital also disparaged the reporters stating that the questions we received from you the propublica reporters last week and the assertions reflected in those questions reflect significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings regarding aspects of magnetar capital’s investment strategy later magnetar capital wrote a letter to its investors rebutting many of the claims in the propublica story ie we wanted to address the recent publicity regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy at the center of these stories is a blatantly false and misleading story written by propublica an online news outlet regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy that was active from 0 through 0 despite our best efforts to educate propublica’s reporters about the specifics of magnetar capital’s mortgage cdo investment strategy as well as the general process and market circumstances regarding the structuring and issuance of cdos propublica simply got the story wrong  despite the claims that these trades lead to price distortions it is generally acknowledged that arbitrage leads to price stability and convergence counter responseedit propublicas editorinchief paul steiger responded to magnetar capitals letter and wrote magnetar capital’s letter doesn’t deny that it purchased collateralized debt obligation cdo equity that it bet against many of those cdos or that it exercised influence over the construction of the portfolios in particular it doesnt deny

tavakoli a financial industry expert and consultant with many years experience had been writing about structured finance in a series of books starting in  in her 0 book structured finance and collateralized debt obligations nd ed she specifically mentioned magnetar capitals constellation cdos in the chapter on the credit crunch and cdos she described the deals as classic long equity short mezzanine a type of deal whose moral hazards she explored elsewhere in the book in addition she wrote constellation cdos seemed designed to fail and were largely synthetic in her diagram of the capital structure she noted that the monoline insurers were major investors elsewhere in the book she predicted the monolines would have huge losses related to cdos and time proved her correct  she also noted that excess interest is sometimes paid to the equity investor creating a conflict of interest a theme that would be central to subsequent media stories propublica  npr  this american life reportedit in 0 this american life of chicago public radio broadcast a radio show on magnetar capitals cdo strategy the report was by alex blumberg of the npr planet money project the report consisted largely of blumbergs interviews with jesse eisinger and jake bernstein of propublica whom blumberg had commissioned to research possible financial misdeeds related to the subprime housing bubble eisinger and bernstein interviewed dozens of people who had worked in the industry and many who were directly involved in magnetar capital deals0 eisinger and bernstein won the pulitzer prize of  for their series on the cdo industry it was the first pulitzer for work published only on the web propublicas written story came out on their website in april 0 coinciding with the radio show it alleged that the companys trades in the cdo market helped worsen the financial crisis of 0–0 by helping to structure cdos it was planning to short bet against0 the story essentially claimed that magnetar capital sponsored mortgagebacked collateralized debt obligations by agreeing to buy the worst tranche portion of the cdo the equity tranche since very few wanted to invest in the risky equity tranche those few that did were called sponsors without them the cdo would never get created the propublica stories claimed that magnetar capital then shorted bet against the better tranches of those and similar cdos by buying credit default swaps that insured them when the middle tranches of the cdos failed magnetar capital made back many times its initial investment in the equity tranche by receiving the insurance payoff the report also claimed that magnetar capital tried to influence the managers of the cdos it was instrumental in creating to buy certain risky bonds that would increase the risk of those cdos failing it also claims that magnetar capital cdos defaulted at a significantly higher rate than similar cdos this may reflect magnetar capitals superior performance in identifying which of the highquality tranches were most overpriced they also claim that the cdo market would have cooled off in late 0 if magnetar capital had not entered the market and that this would have resulted in the financial crisis being less severe magnetar capitals responseedit magnetar capital disputed the story many of its responses were explained in propublicas story and in a detailed letter magnetar capital sent to propublica posted on propublicas website magnetar capital said among other things that it was not betting it was hedging that most of its hedges were against nonmagnetarcapital cdos and that it was not making cdos that were built to fail on purpose it also claimed that its strategy was not based on a downturn in the housing market that is it did not bet that mortgagebacked cdos would default it detailed many of its objections in a letter and list of responses to propublica which are linked to on propublicas website magnetar capital stated to investors that it never sought to bet on the decline of the subprimemortgage market rather the firm states it had no embedded view regarding the direction of housing prices the rate of mortgage defaults or the subprime mortgage market generally instead magnetar capital claimed it sought to profit from arbitrage its perception that the riskiest highyield tranches of cdos were underpriced relative to the lessrisky lowyield tranches the firm expected to make a profit when either the overpriced securities declined or when the underpriced securities appreciated with the collapse of the subprime market magnetar capital lost money on the risky tranches but made a net profit because the overpriced tranches declined even further magnetar capital rejected the idea that it had picked securities purposely so that they would fail the theorycitation needed is that magnetar capital was essentially betting that the likelihood of multiple defaults on the underlying loans was more likely than was reflected in the price of the higher tranches the high prices of the highquality tranches reflected the assumption that any defaults would be localized and unrelated so that it was unlikely that much of the portfolio would default at once magnetar capital was betting that in all likelihood if the equity tranch lost its value the rest of the cdo would lose value as well because many defaults were likely to happen together this is what in fact happenedcitation needed magnetar capital also disparaged the reporters stating that the questions we received from you the propublica reporters last week and the assertions reflected in those questions reflect significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings regarding aspects of magnetar capital’s investment strategy later magnetar capital wrote a letter to its investors rebutting many of the claims in the propublica story ie we wanted to address the recent publicity regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy at the center of these stories is a blatantly false and misleading story written by propublica an online news outlet regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy that was active from 0 through 0 despite our best efforts to educate propublica’s reporters about the specifics of magnetar capital’s mortgage cdo investment strategy as well as the general process and market circumstances regarding the structuring and issuance of cdos propublica simply got the story wrong  despite the claims that these trades lead to price distortions it is generally acknowledged that arbitrage leads to price stability and convergence counter responseedit propublicas editorinchief paul steiger responded to magnetar capitals letter and wrote magnetar capital’s letter doesn’t deny that it purchased collateralized debt obligation cdo equity that it bet against many of those cdos or that it exercised influence over the construction of the portfolios in particular it doesnt deny and in one case admits that it pushed for higher returns and hence greater risk in the portfoliosin short we see nothing in our story to correct propublica continued to publish articles on magnetar capital throughout 0 and  naked

purpose it also claimed that its strategy was not based on a downturn in the housing market that is it did not bet that mortgagebacked cdos would default it detailed many of its objections in a letter and list of responses to propublica which are linked to on propublicas website magnetar capital stated to investors that it never sought to bet on the decline of the subprimemortgage market rather the firm states it had no embedded view regarding the direction of housing prices the rate of mortgage defaults or the subprime mortgage market generally instead magnetar capital claimed it sought to profit from arbitrage its perception that the riskiest highyield tranches of cdos were underpriced relative to the lessrisky lowyield tranches the firm expected to make a profit when either the overpriced securities declined or when the underpriced securities appreciated with the collapse of the subprime market magnetar capital lost money on the risky tranches but made a net profit because the overpriced tranches declined even further magnetar capital rejected the idea that it had picked securities purposely so that they would fail the theorycitation needed is that magnetar capital was essentially betting that the likelihood of multiple defaults on the underlying loans was more likely than was reflected in the price of the higher tranches the high prices of the highquality tranches reflected the assumption that any defaults would be localized and unrelated so that it was unlikely that much of the portfolio would default at once magnetar capital was betting that in all likelihood if the equity tranch lost its value the rest of the cdo would lose value as well because many defaults were likely to happen together this is what in fact happenedcitation needed magnetar capital also disparaged the reporters stating that the questions we received from you the propublica reporters last week and the assertions reflected in those questions reflect significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings regarding aspects of magnetar capital’s investment strategy later magnetar capital wrote a letter to its investors rebutting many of the claims in the propublica story ie we wanted to address the recent publicity regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy at the center of these stories is a blatantly false and misleading story written by propublica an online news outlet regarding our mortgage cdo investment strategy that was active from 0 through 0 despite our best efforts to educate propublica’s reporters about the specifics of magnetar capital’s mortgage cdo investment strategy as well as the general process and market circumstances regarding the structuring and issuance of cdos propublica simply got the story wrong  despite the claims that these trades lead to price distortions it is generally acknowledged that arbitrage leads to price stability and convergence counter responseedit propublicas editorinchief paul steiger responded to magnetar capitals letter and wrote magnetar capital’s letter doesn’t deny that it purchased collateralized debt obligation cdo equity that it bet against many of those cdos or that it exercised influence over the construction of the portfolios in particular it doesnt deny and in one case admits that it pushed for higher returns and hence greater risk in the portfoliosin short we see nothing in our story to correct propublica continued to publish articles on magnetar capital throughout 0 and  naked capitalism  econnededit yves smith of the nakedcapitalismcom along with other bloggers at that site also worked on describing and analyzing magnetar capitals cdo program smith also wrote a book econned how unenlightened self interest undermined democracy and corrupted capitalism in 0 which contains a detailed description of magnetar capitals activities it cites anonymous sources affiliated with institutions that did business with magnetar capital her research was gathered in october 0 and the book came out in march 00 the book goes into detail surrounding the motives of the various parties and the numbers involved that made the deal profitable it also describes the large size of magnetar capitals play in proportion to the subprime market as a whole the book gives a larger context for the magnetar capital arbitrage fitting into smiths thesis of the modern science of economics being largely a failure smith and the nakedcapitalismcom bloggers continued to post articles regarding magnetar capital throughout 0 they also produced a spreadsheet analyzing the magnetar capital cdos similar to the one found at propublica moe tkacik formerly of the wall street journal worked with individuals from nakedcapitalismcom on an article about the relationship and large number of campaign

describes his attempts to sell short positions on the mortgage security market to hedge funds in the report transcript lippman describes magnetar capitals strategy of shorting one part of the cdo while buying the other he also writes about what he thinks their view of the housing market is when asked if they are bearish on housing he says that yes…as they are buying equity and shorting the
