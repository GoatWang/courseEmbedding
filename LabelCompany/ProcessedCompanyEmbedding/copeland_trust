would like it to be known that copeland coating is a wonderful company to do business with i am the head tennis coach at bard college and have had dealings with copeland in the person of steve puzio over these past  years we have used copeland as our “got to” company for all our court needs our six courts have been resurfaced twice steve was involved personally from start to completion both times he came first to advise and determine our needs followed by a quote he made himself accessible always and we eagerly walked the job after the courts dried to insure our total satisfaction copeland allowed us to commit to an acceptable time frame for the job we were always treated respectfully and fairly their many years of experience proved invaluable as their advice was always “spot on” i feel that they are the best in the business i am sure you will agree bard college copeland coating company has been schodack schools preferred pavement coating systems company for over  years copeland has continued to support the school in proper care of the coating repair and budgeting copeland provides durable long lasting coatings professionally installed and supported for the life of the project schodack schools we have worked with copland coating for well over twenty years there work is outstanding and they stand by the what they do john and steve have always been responsive to our needs copland is a st rate organization dave tager indian head camp over the past  years our camps have worked with copeland coating to meet our surfacing needs steve and the team at copeland have consistently exceeded expectation in helping to recondition our sport courts and to build new facilities including our hockey rink and tennis courts i highly recommend them and look forward to working

tennis court surfacing projects i am always impressed with the way you respond to us whether it is to provide an indepth review of existing conditions prepare cost estimates or ensure a surfacing project moves swiftly and smoothly from start to finish we breathe easier when you are on the job and we will continue to recommend copeland coating to our clients for quality and timely work bob retnauer rla vassar college has experienced a very good working relationship with copeland coating during the past  years we currently have  separate tiers of courts consisting of  varsity courts in the north tier  campus use courts in the center tier and  campuslocal community use courts in the south tier copeland management and their front line crew have always responded in a timely manner and have worked under very tight schedules to prepare our courts for the fall tennis season they reconfigured our center tier from  to  doubles courts per a request from the tennis coaching staff with excellent results and have coated our south tier courts in a manner that will lengthen the useful life even though major renovation work is clearly neededi can confidently recommend copeland coating for tennis court recoating and overall renovation work and should add that they are very competitive in their pricing jeff horst vassar college island lake has employed copeland coating for over  years we have found them to be professional and a quality provider of court surfacing they are consistently on time and perform as expected we wouldn’t look anywhere else for this service matt stoltz island lake camp whenever there is any court resurfacing repair or painting the only company i have ever used is copeland coating i have found them to reliable professional and reasonable with regards to pricing fred  ross moskowitz camp westmont track  field has always been a major part of my life  i was an athlete from a young age growing up in new york and now a master official and high school track  field coach  never did i imagine that i would have the ability and opportunity to build a track  field facility every detail was planned carefully  it was very important to me to choose the correct workers and companies that would make my dream a reality  most of the workers were local with many being bethel track  field alumni and families  when it came to choosing a track surfacing company the choices were many but one significantly stood out from the rest…action track surfacing my first meeting with steve hinding  doug stone left me with an impression of honesty and commitment as well as superior knowledge and expertise   they listened carefully to my desires and needs they offered suggestions and a well organized plan to accomplish my goal  they were as concerned with completing a high quality track facility as i was  every question was met with a timely answer  there were no hidden costs  the project was completed in the contracted budget with no surprises  their crews worked perfectly with in the time table  they were clean hard working and professional…even to the point of cutting a slot drain on their hands and knees to meet the desired design  steve has been back several times to check the quality of his work  action track has made sure that i am completely satisfied with the project    each day i arrive at the facility it takes my breath away  the beautiful  lane track javelin runway and sealed walkways all completed by action track surfacing have given my team and the town of bethel a first class track  field facility  i would highly recommend their services for all track  field surfacing needs bethel track copeland coating has been a very reliable company for us over the years when we have had projects they work hard to make sure all our questions and concerns have been met their work crews have always been reliable and the work has been completed on time the end product has always been outstanding we continue to use copeland coating

an answer to your question please contact us so we can help you click on the links below to view answers how can you tell if a scroll is running backwards   three phase scrolls can rotate in either direction depending on how it is wired if running in reverse rotation the compressor will have elevated sound levels reduced current draw and suction pressures will not drop along with a non rise in discharge pressure the compressor will eventually trip on motor protector where do i find what the approved refrigerants are for compressors   compressor refrigerant ratings are based on engineering design displacement and motor specifications these and other factors are used to determine the refrigerant type and application this information is found using the online product information section of our website or by contacting your nearest authorized emerson wholesaler how can the btu rating of a compressor be determined   capacity ratings for copeland® compressors are found on our published performance curves these curves can be obtained through our wholesalers or from the online product information section of our website to use these curves convert the measured suction and discharge pressure readings to their corresponding evaporating and condensing temperatures using a pressuretemperature chart for the refrigerant being used plotting those temperatures on the performance curve tables will reveal the btuh ratings amperage and watts what is the recommended super heat of copeland® compressors   to insure proper compressor cooling and lubrication the minimum operating compressor superheat is  f what is the discharge temperature limit of copeland® compressors   typically the maximum dlt is  f however this temperature can vary depending on specific applications how do you check oil pressure on a semihermetic compressor   net oil pressure is found by subtracting the crankcase pressure from the pressure measured at the oil pump outlet can i mix polyol ester poe and mineral oil mo together   when using cfc or hchc refrigerants poe and mo can be mixed the exception is r that only uses mo or alkyl benzene mineral oil abmo blend hfc refrigerants can only use poe oil where do i find what contactor a compressor takes   contactors can be found in the application bulletin  these bulletins can be located using the online product information section of our website or by contacting your local authorized emerson wholesaler where can i find what starting components a compressor takes   the best place to see what starting components a compressor takes is on this website under online produce information other sources include the emerson climate technologies inc electrical handbook and product information sheet however use caution on when referring to the product information sheets as these may be out dated and contain obsolete information what is the viscosity of poe oil   the viscosity of oils used in copeland® compressors is selected by design of the compressors and varies from  to  centistokes refer to emerson publication no r for further details does emerson have published cross reference information   yes to cross an obsolete compressor or unit to what supersedes it or to cross a competitor to a copeland® compressor log into the online product information section of our website and look under supersession where do i find the bolt torque specifications for copelametic compressors   bolt torque specifications for copelametic compressors can be found in the application bulletins  these bulletins are located using the online product information section of our website or by contacting your local authorized emerson wholesaler can i add an additive to the oil in a system   no additives are not permitted refer to application bulletin  how can i determine the type and quantity of oil in a compressor   this information can be found on the compressor nameplate the oil type will be abbreviated for example min meaning mineral oil or poe meaning polyol ester oil the oil amount is the number found beneath the oil type and is a unit measure of fluid ounces us so if it says  which means  fluid ounces are laser and delta reed valve
