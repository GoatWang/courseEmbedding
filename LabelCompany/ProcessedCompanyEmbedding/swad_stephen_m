doctor as a young boy i was a paperboy i took it very seriously i expanded the route got customers and added services like snow shoveling and cutting lawns i think that helped me later in life with marketing and cash flow i spent the first part of my formative professional years at kpmg where after eight years i was selected to go through a national office rotation program in manhattan i saw the business side of the firm and the national scope even early on i distinguished myself by always seeking to understand my customer i always put myself in the customer’s shoes to figure out what they were thinking—and why— before delivering a thoughtful and respectful solution i also had analytic and people skills that have treated me well throughout my career i eventually transitioned to the securities and exchange commission starting out as a professional accounting fellow in the early ’s and then as the deputy chief accountant where i saw broad view of how the organization worked particularly from the accounting and finance side i remember we identified that there was a need to put more transparency around market risks so i coauthored a rule to address that need and the sec published it it wasn’t easy it took hard work focus and dedication but it was very meaningful steve swad is the new chief executive at rosetta stone courtesy of rosetta stonecourtesy of rosetta stone after the rule was issued i felt good about my tenure there and it was time to do something different i was eventually recruited to go to time warner where i met a number of outstanding leaders that i had heard and read about by this time i developed strong communication skills to go with my business acumen i also had the ability to bring the right people on board when i left time warner for aol i was brought in at a time when they were having some challenges with regulators i was helping out with that early in my tenure that became part of my background next when fannie mae and comverse technology were both having difficulty getting their financial statements filed with the sec i helped both of them get back in compliant it wasn’t easy but my brain doesn’t register challenges i was even like that as a youth i never thought about the challenges never as a paperboy you could start your day by saying “man it’s  o’clock in the morning it’s so early” but i think that’s the wrong focus i focus on where are we where we’re going and what are the steps to get there and i just march i was attracted to rosetta stone because i saw the product helped transform customers in a way that was meaningful i also thought that the market in which the company operates is large and fragmented where rosetta stone had a significant opportunity to grow and flourish as chief executive i want to focus on customers outside the united states and institutional markets like education corporations and governments my passion which has been my passion all along is to focus on strategy growth
