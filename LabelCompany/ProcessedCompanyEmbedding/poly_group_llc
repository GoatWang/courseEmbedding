place in a bottle to squirt the solution on the bed seems if there is a leak it will bubble why won’t my bed properly inflate some possible reasons and solutions  the air release valve is open if the valve is a bostonstyle valve make sure the valve body and cap are tightly closed so air cannot escape after inflation if the valve is the rapid release or quickflow valve close it by using two thumbs to push cover and snap it into place  the pump is not plugged in plug pump into any  volt ac electrical outlet v product sold outside north america  the pump is plugged in but not turned on turn on the power switch on handheld models and turn the dial to the inflate position for builtin models why does my bed loose air after the first few hours or day  air contraction  like a hotair balloon heated air expands when it cools off it contracts the same thing happens when you pump up an airbed the heat created during pump up expands the air inside the mattress after an hour or so it cools off and the mattress loses volume needless to say that if you pumped up your airbed in the heat of the afternoon it will cool off drastically at night when the temperature may drop all that is required is to top the air bed off by using the pump  material expansion  the airbed material can expand slightly when it is pumped up to full volume over time it will stretch when someone lies down upon it after time passes the bed may appear to loose air because of this expansion in either case all that is required is to top the airbed off by using the pump  air is leaking from the valve – see why won’t my

be possible to repair the damage by using the vinyl repair kit included with your product follow all instructions and heed all warnings included in the repair kit since my airbed has flocking how can i use the repair patch as it wont adhere to the flocking the repair patch is designed for vinyl surfaces only however with using fine sandpaper such as an emery board you can gently rub away the flocking when that is complete the repair patch will hold how do i deflate my air bed some air bed pumps are designed to deflate or suck air out in addition to inflating your air bed check and see if your air pump comes with a deflate setting this setting is particularly handy for camping when you want to strike camp quickly if your pump does not have that feature you will have to deflate your air bed manually unscrew or unsnap the cap of the air valve first and listen for escaping air next remove your shoes and walk up and down the length of the air bed once youve done that a few times you can start rolling your air bed from the end opposite the air valve to help the remaining air escape when you have completely rolled up the camping air bed use a cord or the beds bag to keep it in that condensed shape be sure to close your valve and tighten after deflation so it is ready for inflation the next time you use it how do i take care of or store my air bed taking care of an air bed is easy after youve deflated your bed simply place it in the handy carry bag or a box keep it in a safe spot where it will stay protected from extreme heat cold and water make sure you keep all sharp

left and chief scientific officer thomas hopkins say the… more william deshazer they eventually sought to improve their process by pairing up with jeffrey youngblood an associate professor at purdue university’s school of materials engineering in west lafayette ind youngblood had created an innovation known as a hydrophilized bactericidal polymer technology poly group exists to commercialize that research and the product currently goes by the commercial name of nouvex the company is located in the purdue research park of southeast indiana in new albany wide applications nouvex investors — about  people have contributed about  million since  — believe the product could be a gamechanging antibacterial and antiviral product craig kalmer chief operating officer at poly group said it kills  of most bacteria it contacts and it does so in about one to  minutes nouvex’s formulation allows it to become part of a product paper or plastic could be infused with nouvex and it can be mixed into the durable coatings applied to things such as doorknobs where it will fight bacteria as long as the coating lasts plastic laminates can have nouvex infused throughout as can floors kalmer thinks the applications are limitless including a possible health care use urinary catheters which often cause problems for patients because of bacterial buildup can have nouvex added massive market kalmer said poly group is awaiting approval from the us environmental protection agency before it can begin officially selling and licensing nouvex that result is expected anytime before august purdue university owns the patent on the product and the poly group has the exclusive license to take the technology to market kalmer said the antimicrobial additives market is a  billion to  billion industry which leads nouvex investors to believe it could deliver huge returns on their investments “our goal is that within the next five years we get about  percent of that” he said new product one reason for kalmer’s optimism is that nouvex can be added easily to products that already have made it to the market “it’s going to be a lowercost better alternative to what’s out there today” he said and there seems to be no direct competition kalmer said the epa considers nouvex a “brandnew entity” business first asked kalmer whether he had any concerns that nouvex could draw challenges over potential vulnerabilities for example the antibacterial triclosan which is widely used in hand soap and toothpaste has drawn the interest of the us food and drug administration while emphasizing that further study is needed the agency said that studies raise the possibility that triclosan contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics kalmer said nouvex works differently attacking bacteria in a way that bleach would damaging the bacteria’s cell walls antibiotics meanwhile penetrate into bacteria which can develop a sort of “pump” mechanism that allows it to expunge the chemical this won’t happen with nouvex he said and the company believes this eliminates the possibility of superbugs “nouvex doesn’t have to go into the cell in order to kill it” he said “based on our testing we do not cause any sort of mutation in the organization so we do not anticipate that being an issue” about poly group llc business the company has developed an antimicrobial called nouvex founded  address

the cofounders of poly group llc and laminators for the printing trade through their company pro laminators in sellersburg indiana were searching for antimicrobial solutions for the manufacture of printed and laminated products such as menu’s and other enduse items this led them to silverion technology and their efforts helped bring the first antimicrobial thermo laminating film to the market   in an effort to try to improve the film technology haywood and hamilton sought the advice of dr jeffrey youngblood an associate professor in the school of materials engineering at purdue university in west lafayette indiana this led them to the purdue research park of southeast indiana in new albany indiana and its hightech business incubation program with the assistance of paul moses the incubation program’s director and an entrepreneur himself the expanded goal of addressing rampant public health problems created by the spread of dangerous organisms was established with purdue’s support and collaboration further research on dr youngblood’s innovation known as hydrophilized bactericidal polymer technology hbp was begun poly group llc was formed in  and soon after secured the exclusive worldwide rights to hbp from purdue proof of concept continued and by the end of  the company was raising capital and a research laboratory was set up and headed by craig kalmer and thomas hopkins phd both had extensive experience in pharmaceutical research and production and both were former executives in other companies a patent for the technology now known as nouvex™ was secured in late  and the company signed its first joint development agreement in  the research laboratory was expanded a detailed testing strategy for obtaining the proper approvals from the us environmental protection agency epa was also established in preparation for taking nouvex to market the company continued to raise capital to finance the proper epamandated efficacy and toxicology testing the testing continued with outstanding results and by the summer of  all research to file the proper epa applications had been successfully completed pending final epa registration and approval the company expects to go to market with nouvex™ a groundbreaking and highly effective antimicrobial technology in early  latest articles board takes on topics across breadth of profession inappropriate

antimicrobial   nouvex™ technology was discovered at purdue university poly group llc has secured an exclusive worldwide license to the ip covering nouvex™ technology which includes a granted us patent the nouvex™ technology is positively charged so it attracts negatively charged pathogens and destroys them on contact without inducing the resistance nouvex™ is highspeed  it also has very high efficacy which makes it competitive with disinfectants as opposed to traditional antimicrobial additives nouvex™ is also highly persistent and has high surface endurance because it is integrated directly into the material other market competitors are not as valuable because they are applied as a coating that can wipe or wear off over time this integrated character of nouvex™ makes it very desirable for medical uses textiles plastics and even glass applications nouvex™ also gets high biocompatibility ratings and is more biocompatible than other current antimicrobials nouvex™ creates no chemical binding or linking issues unlike other quaternary ammonium compounds and has a large molecular structure providing limited toxicity tunable physical properties allow formulas to be tweaked for efficacy and biocompatibility it can also be soluble or nonsoluble in water or solvents which allows for a great variety of product applications on top of everything else nouvex™ formulas are easy to synthesize making it relatively inexpensive to produce its manufacturing costs are low nouvex™ has proven performance through testing at glp good lab practice laboratories so the epa preservative and health claims will be accessible to the enduse product manufacturers all this makes nouvex™ an immediate replacement for silver ions triclosan copper and other quaternary substances with little or no process modification the efficacy testing was done on a variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella enterica staphylococcus aureus mrsa
