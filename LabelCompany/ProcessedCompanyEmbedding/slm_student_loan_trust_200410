fitch takes various actions on slm student loan trust   business wire fitch takes various actions on slm student loan trust  june    am eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wirefitch ratings has taken the following rating actions on slm student loan trust  slm  class aa aaasf placed on rating watch negative class ab aaasf placed on rating watch negative class aa aaasf placed on rating watch negative class ab aaasf placed on rating watch negative class aa aaasf maintained on rating watch negative class ab aaasf maintained on rating watch negative class a aaasf maintained on rating watch negative class b bbbsf placed on rating watch negative the class a note is eurodenominated at issuance a currency swap agreement was entered into by the trust to mitigate foreign exchange exposure risk arising from the mismatch between us dollar assets of the trust and the eurodollar liabilities of class a the swap counterpartys issuer default rating is now below the minimum threshold specified in fitchs counterparty criteria fitch is currently in the process of examining the sufficiency of arrangements for collateralization of the swap in the event of the swap termination the trust will be exposed to exchange rate risk between the us dollar and the euro a significant increase in the a interest payment caused by a depreciating dollar could reduce the collection funds available for interest and principal payments resulting in an increased risk of default for all outstanding bonds additionally the placement of the a a and b notes on negative watch is due to their inability to pass cash flow stresses necessary to maintain their current ratings on dec   fitch released an exposure draft that delineates revisions it plans to make to the rating us federal family education loan program student loan abs criteria dated june   this transaction was reviewed under both the existing criteria and exposure draft fitch expects to resolve the rating watch negative status once its revised ffelp criteria report is published and further review of the collateral information posted by aig financial products corporation is completed key rating drivers collateral quality the trust collateral consists of  of federal family education loan program ffelp loans the credit quality of the trust collateral is high in fitchs opinion based on the guarantees provided by the transactions eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the us department of education ed for at least  of principal and accrued interest fitch currently rates the us aaa with a stable outlook credit enhancement while both senior and subordinate notes will benefit from future excess spread the senior notes also benefit from subordination provided by the class b notes as of march  total parity is  and senior parity is   ce cash is being released from the trust given that the  total parity is maintained liquidity support liquidity support is provided by a reserve account the reserve is sized equal to the greater of  of the pool balance and  servicing capabilities navient solutions inc fka sallie mae inc is responsible for the day to day servicing of the student loans fitch believes navient solutions to be an acceptable servicer of ffelp student loans in december  fitch released an exposure draft that delineates revisions it plans to make to the rating us federal family education loan program student loan abs criteria dated june   fitch has reviewed transactions under both the existing and proposed criteria on june   fitch published a press release titled fitch finalizing changes to ffelp student loan abs criteria that details likely changes to the final criteria report which it expects to publish in less than  days criteria variations in certain libordown interest rate stress scenarios the basis spread may be compressed as fitch would apply a floor to onemonth libor at a negative rate level in accordance with fitchs criteria for interest rate stresses in structured finance transactions and covered bonds may  since the updated interest rate stresses are not addressed yet in existing ffelp criteria this represents a criteria variation use of the criteria variation did not have a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned under the counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated may   fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness the definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest in are those held in the collection account and the funds can only be invested for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the notes fitch doesnt believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned rating sensitivities since the ffelp student loan abs relies on the us government to reimburse defaults aaasf ffelp abs ratings will likely move in tandem with the aaa us sovereign rating aside from the us sovereign rating defaults basis risk and loan extension risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in ffelp student loan transactions additional defaults basis shock beyond fitchs published stresses lower than expected payment speed and other factors could result in future downgrades likewise a buildup of ce driven by positive excess spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades due diligence usage no third party due
