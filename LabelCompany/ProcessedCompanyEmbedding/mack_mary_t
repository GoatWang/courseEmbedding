advisors megan leonhardt  nov   wealthmanagementcom you’ve mentioned in the past the importance of making the client experience simpler what do you mean mary mack there are a couple of things to that one of them in a big way is simplifying the way we deliver the way we inform clients the way we ensure they understand and even the way they sign we introduced this year a consolidated signature page we took out unnecessary disclosures we also just rolled out esignature for clients across all of our channels   wm how is wfa’s smartstation  migration going mm i think we just completed the last phase of rollouts we just did probably our biggest platform upgrade—certainly outside of a merger and we did it without training because it’s so intuitive along the way we’ve also had to go through a systematic upgrade of bandwidth and some systematic infrastructure improvements that have gone really well in terms of speed of delivery easy navigation and execution   wm what is the timeline for rolling out the expected smart to go tablet app what is that going to be like for the advisor mm the full rollout is slated for the second quarter of next year it will enable an fa to lock down the client data so that they can do a more dynamic client presentation on their tablet it will give them the mostfrequently used applications in a truly mobile format   wm what’s been wells’ approach with its highnetworth partnership referral program between the banking and brokerage channels how does wells’ strategy differ from other firms in this space mm the strategy here is very clientcentric advicedriven the client deserves access to the best we have to offer across our firm we began to think about the private bank as not just a relationship manager—which is what they do for many clients—but also as a product provider we asked “how can those private bankers provide customized banking product to a wells fargo advisor’s relationship”   wm how do you address advisor concerns about handing off their clients to private bankers mm advisors have an incredible amount of passion for their client relationships i love that we’ve said that it’s your client relationship we’re not asking anybody to hand off a client to anybody instead you’re bringing somebody in as a member of your team you’re still the quarterback of that team the financial coach for your client but you bring somebody into your team to add to a relationship as opposed to turn over a relationship   wm wfa doesn’t offer as rich of a recruitment compensation package as some of its competitors why is that mm what we try to do is talk to a financial advisor about the entire value proposition with the transition bonus being just one part of it i believe another part of that is the tremendous value in the brand to be associated with the wells fargo brand has a real tangible value that we can demonstrate to a recruit   wm no plans to bring that in line with other firms and the checks they’re cutting mm we’ve looked at it and we track it there are no plans necessarily to change ours in response to that because we’re really pleased with our results if you look at the whole don’t get me wrong i think that transition bonus is very important to financial advisors but it’s one element of a broader relationship   wm raymond james seems to be targeting wfa for potential recruits what is your strategy to address this mm i would say in terms of recruiting one of the things we’ve been working a lot on is the development and empowerment of our managers a lot of what financial advisors are looking for is the support of their local manager so how do we empower our managers we’ve just added another region we think that enables our regional leaders to have more interaction with fas they still have large regions but they’re smaller than they were to enable them to be closer to the field closer to complexes closer to the fas that’s one of our best retention strategies—that we have great managers   wm you’ve said the traditional methods of incentivizing and motivating nextgen recruits are not working how is the firm bringing in the next generation of advisors mm we’re piloting some different ways of training this year we’re getting ready to start the third class in the associated financial advisors program it’s more of a mentorship program that’s a combination of st louisbased classroom training and then curriculumbased field training the formal curriculum will be at least two years longer than our traditional financialadvisorintraining program which was only about seven weeks in addition the program provides an apprenticeship model ensuring that every associate is paired with an experienced successful advisor each associated financial advisor has a dedicated performance coach who provides accountability oversight and support throughout their development they receive two to three years of a stable salary along with the ability to increase their compensation through revenuesharing opportunities   wm how big is the associated financial advisor pilot program mm we will hire a total of  this year that are in pilot and are targeting  or more next year that’s just one element of our training we’ve still got our other financial advisor training going on then theres another program that david kowach is starting in the private client group pcg branches advisors who are evaluating their business and thinking about how they begin to rationalize their book to a more manageable client base can work with another advisor even trainees skilled in best practices who are looking to add clients  ultimately the goal should be an improved client experience one where the advisors both the one looking to transfer the account and the other looking to take on more clients accomplish their goals too”   wm there’s been ongoing discussion regarding wfa’s hybrid legacy profit formula model that has actually been discontinued but under which some advisors still operate what is the firm planning to do with these advisors mm many of our really successful financial advisors in the private client group are in profit formula profit formula is a part of pcg it’s not a separate business it’s populated with many of our best practice advisors our highest growth advisors so it’s a successful part it’s been supported as a part of the private client group and continues to be supported we have no plans to shut it down   wm will there be any kind of hybrid offering for new teams that are interested mm we want to continue to support the advisors who are in profit formula because they’re terrific advisors there wasn’t any plan to change that element but if we’re looking at what advisors are looking for we need to ask if there are solutions already in our existing channels we have a lot of conversations between pcg and finet to see if that’s a better fit   wm with devon mcconnell coming aboard as head of wfa digital how is that helping to evolve the firms technology mm  we are really excited to have devon right now shes doing a lot of direct client research what do full service clients expect in their relationship with their advisor how are other influences in other parts of their lives now begun to impact the way they think about their digital financial experience as we go into next year youll begin to see those similar impacts on the client side of technology they notice now the service experience through their advisors ability to more quickly deliver what wed like to see is for them to see their advisor through digital technology   wm  speaking of digital wells fargo had a pilot program for twitter and social media are there plans to continue that what’s up next for the firm in that area mm  we have been running a pilot a twitter pilot a social media pilot weve got plans to expand that infrastructure things that we need to look at weve got to think about it as an industry how do we think about retention and capture in the social media space differently it goes back to that digital experience i really think that its not just a generational thing there is a prevalence of it as the generations get younger we have certainly thought of technology as functional now weve got to begin thinking of technology as relational and thats very different from the way our industry has interacted in the past wm you’ve been busy in this first year visiting branch offices on an almost weekly basis what do you do during your downtime mm  im training for a half‑marathon for some crazy reason it started on a dare i work out with a couple of friends and they did it i told them they were crazy i decided that maybe it wasnt such a bad idea after all   wm whats the most played song on your playlist mm  do you know what i listen to i listen to podcasts what i listen to is the bob and sheri show which is a syndicated radio talk show out of charlotte i listen every morning to yesterdays podcast   tags people  comments
