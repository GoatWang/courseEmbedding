fuller products co on chicagos south side whistle and admire the women passing by go head now one boy hollers outthe boys probably have no idea of the significance of fuller products or of the story of sb fuller the man who founded the company and still runs it but go head now pretty well sums up the attitude of the man now  who started the firm  years ago and made it at one time the nations biggest blackowned companyive always had faith in myself and wanted to move ahead to lift myself said fuller slowspoken and slightly stooped i had this in me when i started my business i was  thenfuller came to chicago from his native monroe la with hopes of moving ahead born to a sharecroppers family he had a sixth grade education and little moneyhe started his business with  from this base he built what was the largest blackowned company in the country in the s and early s averaging sales of  million in the process he gave a start to men and women who have become among the most powerful black executives in the nation that  was really all the money i had to my name fuller saidand i had that much because i went and had my car refinanced and they gave me  in what they said was some earned interesti was happy to get it and i wanted to use the money to do something that could do me and my family some goodfuller used the money to buy a load of soap with this he set up a door todoor selling business with one employeehimself he peddled the soap and as the business grew he hired more salespeopleour territory included blacks and whites all over the city said fuller who plays down racism i always sold to both i never thought otherwisebut while fullers business grew white banks refused to lend him moneymost of my financing came from blacks right here from the communityby  fuller had dozens of salesmen welldefined sales areas and a small factory on the south sidei cant say i was surprised by our growth but i was ready for it i had faith in selling door to door fuller saidfuller made one acquisition after another in the mids he bought the whiteowned boyer international laboratories inc which made and sold jean nadal cosmetics the companys clientele was predominantly white and in the souththey were strongest in the south fuller said the sale was handled quietly and not many people knew the person who bought the company was a black man the owners had some trouble and wanted to sell it i wanted to grow and i was able to buy boyerfullers other purchases included real estate and several smaller blackowned firms he also owned fullerphilco home

in the early s with annual sales of more than  million offices in  states and more than  employees it was one of the most profitable blackowned businesses in the country but hard times were coming in the civil rights era fuller found himself under attack by blacks and whitesthe white citizens councils a white supremacist southern group learned that a black man owned jean nadal cosmetics and organized a boycott of his company fuller said jean nadal was one of his key lines and the boycott hurta major corporation offered to buy the nadal line armed with that promise fuller bought a department store on th street but the deal to sell the nadal line fell through and fuller products sank into debtthe company was dealt another blow in  by a boycott staged by blacks angered by a fuller speech to the national association of manufacturers in which he said that a lack of understanding of the capitalist system and not racial barriers was keeping blacks from making progressthis hurt us too i dont blame anybody for that boycott fuller said they didnt understand a lot still dont understandin  legal troubles began fuller was accused of violating the federal securities act by misstating material acts to purchasers of promissory notes and selling the notes in interstate commerce without registering themfuller had sold the notes in an effort to bail out his company he pleaded guilty and was placed on five years probation and ordered to repay  million to creditorsthe company entered bankruptcy in  after reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws the firm reported profits of  in gwynne nettles an assistant to fuller who has been with the company for  years said we took a real bashing in the s and s we were a company in crisis but were in a state of rebirth and
