prestigious universities columbia university and new york university here are the milstein and tisch philanthropic family trees tracing back to seymour and vivian milstein the milstein family tree has a longstanding tradition of philanthropy the late seymour who passed away in  and his wife vivian were dedicated to scientific advancement that interest can be traced back to vivian’s father joshua h lenier a neurologist and the first practicing psychiatrist in bronx county vivian and seymour had a special interest in supporting new york presbyterian hospital and columbia medical center mr milstein served as chairman of the board from  and following that served as chairman emeritus until his death five years later the power couple also established the milstein awards “a pinnacle of

chain it is a place that shapes young bright women into strong confident wellintentioned leaders in all fields and does so regardless of their socioeconomic background it is an honor to give these incredible and impressive barnard women the chance at succeeding by allowing them access to the best education in an environment that promotes confidence encourages strong ideas and opinions and empowers women” the family not only gives to their alma mater and the field of medicine but also to the arts tamar podell senior vice president of planning and development at lincoln center for the

you let gun violence persist and gun fashion without specific messaging to continue unchallenged i think that’s a problem” wear it don’t bear it offers a solution she knows it won’t happen overnight but she feels strongly that it is her generation who must stand up and do something about the rise of violence in american culture “in the ‘s and ‘s they had the war which led to the sds students for a democratic society and the largest student strike in american history in response to the kent state shootings this is ours this is tucson this is fort hood this is aurora this is sandy hook and i

and howard milstein over their family’s real estate and banking empire is getting uglier with new allegations that howard milstein used funds from family assets he controlledthe douglas elliman residential real estate brokerage and the milford plaza hotelto finance ventures into sports real estate and the internet on the heels of a courtordered audit of douglas elliman’s books which found more than  million in interestfree loans from the company to howard milstein’s private ventures philip milstein has asked a delaware judge to strip his cousin of ownership of the businesses placing them in the hands of a family trust the lawsuit marks a dramatic escalation of the family feud which has paralyzed one of the city’s richest families with holdings worth a reported  billion and along with recent filings in another case over the milford plaza it gives the fullest answer yet to the questions that have lingered over the whole mess since it burst into public view last spring what caused a longstanding division of power between the two sides of this powerful new york family headed by brothers paul and seymour milstein to break down and why now with the family’s investments more profitable than ever philip milstein seymour’s son says he has gone to war to keep howard milstein from doing to the rest of the family businesses what he did to douglas elliman philip milstein says howard milstein has been attempting to liquidate pieces of the family assets he controls freeing himself and his younger brother edward to pursue their own business ventures howard milstein sold douglas elliman last year for about  million a substantial profitbut not with the permission of the company’s stockholders all family members and not before he used the company as a piggy bank philip milstein says an audit “confirmed philip milstein’s growing suspicion that the defendants had been engaged in systematic mismanagement waste of corporate assets selfdealing and appropriation of money belonging to the companies for their private ventures” according to a complaint filed in delaware chancery court in july a lengthy auditor’s report filed along with the lawsuit purports to show that howard milstein raided the cashrich business to finance among other investments his personal stake in the new york islanders hockey franchise his unsuccessful bids to buy the nfl’s cleveland browns and washington redskins and his purchase of a halfshare of the chicago commercial brokerage miglinbeitler howard milstein subsequently renamed the chicago brokerage douglas ellimanbeitler and expanded into new york operating free of his family’s control on paper all the loans appear to have been paid back though the auditors said douglas elliman’s bookkeeping was so sloppy that it was impossible to know for sure philip milstein is not claiming that any money was stolen but he has now turned his attention to the milford plaza hotel where he expects auditors to find similar “misconduct” according to an affidavit filed in new york state supreme court in manhattan “none of the allegations are true” said james quinn an attorney for howard milstein mr quinn has yet to file an answer to philip milstein’s complaint and said he had no further comment in response to previous suits howard milstein has pointed to the flush balance sheets of the companies he controls and has contended that seymour and philip milstein have thwarted his efforts to sell develop or otherwise profitably dispose of family assets the lawsuits he suggests are part of an effort to smear him and gain leverage in an overall dispute over the control of family assets including a property on nd street at eighth avenue and emigrant savings bank which philip milstein heads howard milstein and his father paul are suing to have him removed for alleged mismanagement paul and seymour milstein have been meeting periodically to work out a “global resolution” to the disputes according to court documents several sources close to the milstein family say john zuccottia former deputy mayor and family lawyer who is now a top developer himselfis mediating the talks recent developments however make a resolution look unlikely “you may not realize this” howard milstein wrote in a june  letter to his cousin “but two can play the same game you’re playing” philip milstein says his suspicions were first aroused in the spring of  when howard stopped passing on financial information about douglas elliman he asked his cousin to call a board meeting and was ignored at the end of the year he says the company failed to distribute profits to its shareholders the real estate market had just entered its current bull cycle and douglas elliman had netted a profit of  million for the year at the same time “no doubt related to the increase in available cash” philip milstein’s suit says howard and edward milstein began chasing their owner’sbox dreams in february  they headed a group which bought the islanders for  million he unloaded the team this year for a  million loss through the spring and summer of  they chased the browns frustrated in cleveland they turned their attention late in the year to the redskins mounting a leaguerecord  million bid for the team after douglas elliman was sold philip milstein sued to get access to the company’s books a delaware judge ruled that his cousin had “stonewalled” him and ordered the books opened to a forensic audit auditors from the firm of ftikahn found that while howard and edward milstein were chasing sports teams they had advanced  million to the islanders  million to cleveland sports ventures and  million to washington sports ventures all from douglas elliman accounts hats and vases the company’s chief financial officer and its office manager were sent to work on these and other projects the lawsuit says everything from travel expenses to redskins hats to tiffany vaseswedding presents for islanders’ players ken belanger jason dawe scott lachance and tom chorskewere charged to douglas elliman company records show according to the audit howard milstein also loaned company money for a number of other personal business ventures  million for various real estate developments  million in venture capital financing for two internet startups news alert and databid  million toward a nowstalled redevelopment initiative in niagara falls ny along with  for a boxing hall of fame he plans to put there and  million towards douglas elliman–beitler mr milstein put a law firm wiel gotshal and manges on a  a month retainer though it seems the firm never did any work for douglas elliman before defending the company against philip milstein’s lawsuits according to the audit and the audit detailed  million in rent and lease payments on behalf of another law firm constantine and partners along with  in payments for unspecified legal services mr milstein’s wife is a founding partner in the firm “it is unclear” the auditors wrote “how or if these obligations were retired” in fact the auditors said “unusual and unconventional accounting practices” made it difficult to figure out exactly who owed what to whom even if all the interestfree loans were repaid however the auditors estimate that douglas elliman could have made  million simply by investing the money in the stock market to put the size of the loans in perspective the auditors noted that over three years douglas elliman paid out a total of  million to the brothers’ private ventures it spent  million on everything else howard and edward milstein’s pursuit of the washington redskins collapsed in april  amid questions about the solidity of their finances around the same time the brothers’ debts to douglas elliman reached about  million that may howard milstein closed the deal to sell douglas elliman to the insignia financial group philip milstein contends that his cousins lied to insignia and perjured themselves in forms filed with the delaware secretary of state by stating that shareholders had agreed to the sale he notes that the brokerage has seen a  percent increase in revenues since it was sold and wonders whether it could have secured a higher price if shopped around longer the sale the lawsuit says “had everything to do with the need to raise cash quickly” afterwards howard milstein held onto several million dollars the auditors saidincluding philip milstein’s  million cutwhich they continued to plow into their own ventures in november the amount of the outstanding loans reached close to  million that’s when philip milstein filed suit to get access to the books “in the months subsequent to philip milstein filing suit in delaware in november  a novel event for the partnership occurred” the report said “the outstanding balances due from the howard milstein ventures to the partnership were reduced as a result of funds received from unknown sources” philip milstein isn’t sure of the source of the funds but he’s trying to find out if the delaware lawsuit goes forward howard milstein’s numerous private ventures will likely be subjected to audits themselves as part of the discovery process and back in new york philip milstein has sued to get access to the books of the milford plaza hotel philip milstein has been trying to get a look at the hotel’s financial records for months first by asking then by suing a scathing exchange of letters over the summer provides an unexpurgated view of the rancor between the two sides of the family nasty letters “i am sorry you find it necessary to harass us with useless correspondence” howard milstein wrote on june  he went on to note that the hotel had doubled in profitability over the past five years pulling in  million a year “i hope you will think better of this silliness and see if the current initiatives to resolve the friction between our families can bear fruit” on june  philip milstein responded “it is not a question of profitability bank versus hotel or otherwise but rather a question of accountability to your partners” on july  howard milstein extended an invitation to review the records “anytime after labor day” soon after philip milstein sued in an affidavit filed in connection with that suit philip milstein made his suspicions clear “given howard’s pattern of conduct i am concerned that absent scrutiny by his partners he may misuse the partnership’s assets or engage in unauthorized transactions” philip milstein also elaborated on a series of clashes with his cousin all of them following the same pattern howard trying to develop or divest seymour and philip trying to thwart him at nd street howard’s negotiations with potential tenants for a story office building were quickly followed by letters to the tenants from seymour saying howard was not authorized to develop the site in  howard negotiated a sale of the milford plaza for  million to an undisclosed buyer on aug  of that year his father paul sent a memo reminding him to consult his uncle “i wouldn’t be in such a rush” he wrote the next day seymour milstein sent a memo of his own written in capital letters “please consider this as notice that you do not have my approval” seymour later relented but by that time the opportunity had slipped away according to a counterclaim filed by howard milstein in august  howard claims his cousin scuttled another deal this one to lease the hotel for  million a year howard milstein claims philip “maliciously sought to interfere with the deal with the intent to harm the partnership and particularly his cousin howard milstein” he’s asking for  million in damages at a hearing held aug  howard milstein’s attorney questioned philip milstein’s motives in bringing the suit in the first place “the purpose of these things is to get these things into the paper to say negative things about our client” he argued supreme court justice barry cozier ordered that philip milstein be allowed access to the financial record within  days but threatened sanctions if he brought more “unnecessary litigation” philip milstein’s auditors are currently examining the hotel’s books their report is expected in a few months barring an unexpected breakthrough the family now faces a series of long and embarrassing court battles the damages the fight has already caused the milsteins are incalculable the nd street site which paul and seymour long hoped to develop will be auctioned off sometime soon in a bidding process overseen by an impartial referee manhattan attorney judah gribetz the family name which howard milstein had hoped to burnish
