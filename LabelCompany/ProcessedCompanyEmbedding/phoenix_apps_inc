  basis of presentation the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and are presented in us dollars the company’s yearend is december    certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period’s financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements the estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments   revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with asc ”revenue recognition”    the company recognizes revenue from services only when all of the following criteria have been met     i persuasive evidence for an agreement exists   ii service has been provided   iii the fee is fixed or determinable and   iv collection is reasonably assured        table of contents   revenue related to multimedia downloads is fully recognized when the above criteria are met   cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   fair value of financial instruments asb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date fasb asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value fasb asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level   – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level   – observable inputs other than level  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   level   – unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation   if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument   research and development expenses we follow asc  “research and development” and expense research and development costs when incurred accordingly research and development costs for software and apps are expensed when the work has been performed or milestone results have been achieved research and development costs of  and  were incurred for the three months ended march   and  respectively   basic and diluted income loss per share the company computes income loss per share in accordance with fasb asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted income loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive   no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued or outstanding during the three months ended march   and    recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no  “plan accounting defined benefit pension plans topic  defined contribution pension plans topic  health and welfare benefit plans topic  employee benefit plan master trust reporting” among other things the amendments require a plan’s interest in that master trust and any change in that interest to be presented in separate line items in the statement of net assets available for benefits and in the statement of changes in net assets available for benefits respectively the amendments also remove the requirement to disclose the percentage interest in the master trust for plans with divided interests and require that all plans disclose the dollar amount of their interest in each of those general types of investments the amendments require all plans to disclose a their master trust’s other asset and liability balances and b the dollar amount of the plan’s interest in each of those balances lastly the amendments eliminate redundant investment disclosures eg those required by topics  and  relating to h account assets effective for fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the amendments should be applied retrospectively to each period for which financial statements are presented the company does not anticipate the adoption of asu  will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements        table of contents   in february  the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no  “other income – gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets subtopic  clarifying the scope of asset derecognition guidance and accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets” the amendments clarify that a financial asset is within the scope of subtopic  if it meets the definition of an in substance nonfinancial asset the amendments also define the term in substance nonfinancial asset the amendments clarify that nonfinancial assets within the scope of subtopic  may include nonfinancial assets transferred within a legal entity to a counterparty for example a parent may transfer control of nonfinancial assets by transferring ownership interests in a consolidated subsidiary a contract that includes the transfer of ownership interests in one or more consolidated subsidiaries is within the scope of subtopic  if substantially all of the fair value of the assets that are promised to the counterparty in a contract is concentrated in nonfinancial assets the amendments clarify that an entity should identify each distinct nonfinancial asset or in substance nonfinancial asset promised to a counterparty and derecognize each asset when a counterparty obtains control of it effective at the same time as the amendments in update  revenue from contracts with customers topic  therefore public business entities certain notforprofit entities and certain employee benefit plans should apply the amendments in this update to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period all other entities should apply the amendments in this update to annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within annual periods beginning after december   all other entities may apply the guidance earlier as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period all other entities also may apply the guidance earlier as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance an entity is required to apply the amendments in this update at the same time that it applies the amendments in update  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact this standard may have on its financial position and results of operations   in january  the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no  “intangibles  goodwill and other topic  simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” these amendments eliminate step  from the goodwill impairment test the annual or interim goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit in addition income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable the amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and if it fails that qualitative test to perform step  of the goodwill impairment test an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary effective for public business entities that are a sec filers for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january   asu  should be adopted on a prospective basis the company does not anticipate the adoption of asu  will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in january  the fasb issued asu no  business combinations topic  clarifying the definition of a business this new standard clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set is not a business this new standard will be effective for the company on january   however early adoption is permitted with prospective application to any business development transaction   management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued the company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements        table of contents   note  – going concern   as of the three months ended march

doubt as to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company estimates that it will require additional cash resources during  based on its current operating plan and condition the company expects cash flows from operating activities to improve primarily as a result of an increase in revenue and a decrease in certain operating expenses although there can be no assurance thereof the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern if we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing when required we may have to modify delay or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans   note  – related party transactions   in support of the company’s efforts and cash requirements it may rely on advances from related parties until such a time that the company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or

unanticipated events   as used in this quarterly report the terms “we” “us” “our” and “our company” means phoenix apps inc unless otherwise indicated   we were originally organized as a corporation in the state of nevada on november   and on november   we acquired a portfolio of mobile software applications for smartphones and tablets “apps” pursuant to an asset purchase agreement entered into by and between the company and the owners of the apps corey wadden and saba mirzaagha both individuals residing in ontario canada “asset purchase agreement” pursuant to the asset purchase agreement we purchased the portfolio of apps from mr wadden and mr mirzaagha for an aggregate purchase price of  and entered into an employment agreement with each of them pursuant to the employment agreements which are effective january   each of mr wadden and mr mirzaagha are required to devote at least ten  hours per week to the company’s business during their term of employment which is for a minimum of one  year after one  year either party may terminate the agreement upon sixty  days notice to the other party    under each employment agreement we agreed to provide to mr wadden and mr mirzaagha each a five hundred dollars  for the first three  months following the effective date of january   b one thousand dollars  per month thereafter c  restricted shares of the company’s common stock effective november   and d an appointment to our board of directors in addition after the effective date of january   as an incentive payment each of mr wadden and mr mirzaagha will be paid ten percent  of the company’s profits with “profits” defined as the company’s total revenue minus total expenses on an annual basis while they are employed by the company prorated for partial years    we offer free apps and paid apps consumers download our apps through the apple app store or the amazon app store we believe that we have a unique strategy which we will utilize for our app development process there are three essential steps which we will follow from inception to release   analyze  we study the market on a regular daily or weekly basis and study the top selling and popular new apps in order to discern what makes these apps popular and appealing   emulate – after studying the market we screen top apps for ones that we feel we can improve on cost effectively and efficiently we take apps that have a proven demand in the marketplace emulate the core concept and create what we believe to be a better product        table of contents   development   – the development is done both locally and overseas depending on the complexity of the app number of anticipated changes during development and price   the markets for our apps are characterized by rapid technological change particularly in the technical capabilities of smartphones and tablets and changing enduser preferences therefore we will be required to continuously invest capital to innovate and publish new apps and modify existing apps we cannot assure that we will have adequate capital to develop new apps or modify existing apps or that we will be successful in creating new apps   competition   we believe that the apps have the following strengths and weaknesses relative to the competition in the market   strengths and opportunities      unique and novel apps and reliable source codes the market currently includes many apps which are copycat apps our apps however are original and novel in their category      we believe that we can increase our revenue from the development of new apps and improving certain apps that already exist within our portfolio   weaknesses      lack of marketing  our most significant weakness is that we have never had sufficient capital to undertake any amount of marketing if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue or financing we will not have funds to be used in marketing to grow our business      android os updates  so far the apps have been updated to the latest available android  marshmallow version but future updates could break some functionalities with each android update some of our apps’ functionalities become unusable and we must then update our apps to cure such broken functionalities typically users of android devices download new operating systems a slow pace and therefore it is anticipated that it will take at least  years for the effects to be realized      workability  we cannot guarantee that we can make all of our apps will work with all versions of android devices therefore we must predict how our customer base will adopt new android operating system versions and modify our apps to work with the highest percentage of its customers’ devices   target market   phoenix apps is focused on operating through the apple app store and the amazon app store   marketing strategy   on the majority of the apps we will develop we intend to offer a free basic version to advertise for a paid premium version of the same app we believe that free apps will create the most opportunities for downloads of our apps   we will study analytics related to number of downloads of our apps daily rankings of our apps in the apple app store and amazon app store how often users use the apps after purchasing and sales of apps we will use the analytics to make changes to our apps in an effort to increase sales of the apps   we also intend to utilize facebook twitter and youtube in an effort to build a customer base for our apps        table of contents   results of operations   for the three  month period ended march   we generated  in revenue

part i   item  business   overview   phoenix apps inc the company or we was incorporated in the state of nevada on november   and commenced operations on november   the company develops android and apple mobile applications the companys fiscal year end is december    on november   we acquired a portfolio of mobile software applications for smartphones and tablets “apps” pursuant to an asset purchase agreement the “agreement” by and between the company and third parties   under the terms of the agreement the parties agreed to sell certain assets properties and contractual rights to the company for  the “acquisition” the  was paid by a related party and subsequently the company provided  shares of common stock to the related party for the  payment and for  payment for legal fees further under the terms of the agreement the company will employee two managers for a minimum term of one year in addition the individuals will be entitled to  of the company’s annual profits as defined by the agreement the company allocated the  purchase price to intangible assets as the assets purchased were without physical substance and were paid by the related party the intangible asset value was recorded as the full purchase price and subsequently impaired as at december   further under the terms of the agreement the employees were issued a total of  shares of common stock valued at par  per share   on may   the company’s offering of  shares at  per share for total proceeds of  received a notice of effect from the securities and exchange commission the company closed the fully subscribed offering on september   and issued the shares on october   the company’s shares have not yet been traded on the otc marketplace        table of contents   item a risk factors   risk factors relating to phoenix apps inc and its business   losses from continuing operations may occur and as a result the price of our common stock may be negatively affected if we are not able to grow our business the results of our operations and our financial condition may be adversely impacted   our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern which may hinder our ability to obtain further financing   the audited financial statements for the year twelve months ended december   and december   were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business our independent registered public accounting firm has included “going concern” notes it its reports on the foregoing financial statements that the company has not had significant revenues and requires additional capital and that the company has not established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and requires additional capital to commence its operating plan uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern may hinder our ability to obtain future financing continued operations and our ability to continue as a going concern are dependent on our ability to obtain additional funding in the near future and thereafter and there are no assurances that such funding will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty without additional funds from sales of equity instruments traditional financing such as loans obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders and sales of apps we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to commence our operating plan if we cannot obtain adequate capital our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us   if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with apple and amazon our business will suffer   the apple app store and the amazon app store are our primary distribution marketing promotion and payment platform for our apps we expect to generate substantially all of our revenue through those platforms for the foreseeable future any deterioration in our relationship with apple or amazon would harm our business and adversely affect the value of our stock   we are subject to apple’s and amazon’s standard terms and conditions for application developers which govern the promotion distribution and operation of games and other applications on their platform   our business would be harmed if   · apple or amazon discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other app developers · apple or amazon removes one of our revenueproducing apps from their store · apple or amazon modifies its terms of service or other policies including fees charged to or other restrictions on us or other application developers or change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the their platform or shared by users from apples and amazon’s strong brand recognition and large user base   if apple or amazon lose their market position or otherwise fall out of favor with internet users we would need to identify alternative channels for marketing promoting and distributing our apps which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective in addition apple and amazon have broad discretion to change their terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers and those changes may be unfavorable to us        table of contents    we operate in a new and rapidly changing industry which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects   mobile apps from which we expect to derive all of our revenue is a new and rapidly evolving industry the growth of the mobile app industry and the level of demand and market acceptance of our apps are subject to a high degree of uncertainty our future operating results will depend on numerous factors affecting the mobile app industry many of which are beyond our control including   · changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences · the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment · the worldwide growth of personal computer broadband internet and mobile device users and the rate of any such growth and · general economic conditions particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending   our ability to plan for app development distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in the tastes and preferences of our current and potential users new and different types of entertainment may increase in popularity at the expense of mobile apps a decline in the popularity of apps in general or our apps in particular would harm our business and prospects   we have a new business model and a short operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results and may increase the risk that we will not be successful   corey wadden and saba mirzaagha from whom we purchased the apps didn’t begin operations in in the mobile apps business until november  and we have a short operating history and a new business model which makes it difficult to effectively assess our future prospects   our growth depends on our ability to consistently launch new apps that achieve significant popularity each of our apps requires significant engineering marketing and other resources to develop launch and sustain via regular upgrades our ability to successfully launch sustain and expand apps and attract and retain a userbase largely will depend on our ability to   · anticipate and effectively respond to changing app interests and preferences · anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape · anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape · effectively market new apps and enhancements to our existing users and new users · minimize launch delays and cost overruns on new apps and · minimize downtime and other technical difficulties        table of contents   if our apps do not maintain their popularity our results of operations could be harmed   in addition to creating new apps that are attractive to a significant number of users we must extend the life of our existing apps in particular our most successful apps for an app to remain popular we must constantly enhance expand or upgrade it with new features users find useful such constant enhancement requires the investment of significant resources particularly with older apps and such costs on average have increased we may not be able to successfully enhance expand or upgrade our current apps   our apps target a specific market and may be negatively impacted by updates to the android platform and unfavorable reviews which could harm our business and results of operations    because our apps are very specific on what they can do there is potential for them to be serving too narrow of a market another risk posed to our apps are updates to the android platform which could render some of our apps or their features obsolete in addition negative reviews or ratings by app users could lower the number of downloads of our apps each of the foregoing could harm our business and results of operations   any failure or significant interruption in our network could impact our operations and harm our business   our technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our apps and to user satisfaction our apps run on a complex distributed system or what is commonly known as cloud computing this system is operated by third parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace we expect this dependence on third parties to continue   security breaches computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations   security breaches computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our systems in the future any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data software hardware or other computer equipment and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business financial condition and operating results   we face significant competition there are low barriers to entry in the search engine optimization industry and competition is intense    the search engine optimization industry is highly competitive and we expect more competitors to emerge we face competition from a number of competitors who offer search engine optimization software some of these current emerging and potential competitors have significant resources for developing or acquiring additional software solutions and have a more diversified set of revenue sources than we do and may be less severely affected by changes in consumer preferences regulations or other developments that may impact the search engine optimization increased competition could result in loss of existing customers or reduce our ability to acquire new customers both of which could harm our business        table of contents    there are low barriers to entry in the app industry and competition is intense   the app industry is highly competitive with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of apps to be introduced in addition we have limited experience in developing apps for mobile and other platforms and our ability to succeed on those platforms is uncertain as we continue to devote resources to developing apps for those platforms we will face significant competition from established companies and newcomers some of these current emerging and potential competitors have significant resources for developing apps and have a more diversified set of revenue sources than we do and may be less severely affected by changes in consumer preferences regulations or other developments that may impact the market for mobile apps increased competition could result in loss of existing users or reduce our ability to acquire new users both of which could harm our business   we may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future   we may face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties including from our competitors nonpracticing entities and former employers of our personnel patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive and the results are difficult to predict as the result of any court judgment or settlement we may be obligated to cancel the launch of a new app stop offering an app or certain features of an app pay royalties or significant settlement costs purchase licenses or modify our apps and features while we develop substitutes   failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could harm our business and operating results   we regard the protection of our trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights as critical to our success and we rely on trade secret protection and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights however trade secret protection and copyright law may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others further in some instances we may be required to obtain licenses to intellectual property in lieu of ownership such licenses may be limited in scope and require us to renegotiate on a frequent basis for additional use rights moreover to the extent we only have a license to any intellectual property used in our software there may be no guarantee of continued access to such intellectual property including on commercially reasonable terms   we could be required to cease certain activities andor incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party’s intellectual property rights   some of our competitors may own technology patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets and website content which they may use to assert claims against us in recent years there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights companies in the internet and technology industries are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights as we face increasing competition and as litigation becomes a more common way to resolve disputes we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to claims that we have misappropriated or misused other parties’ intellectual property rights if we are sued by a third party that claims that our technology infringes its rights the litigation with or without merit could be expensive and could divert our management resources   the results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party may require us to do one or more of the following     · cease making selling offering for sale or using technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property     · make substantial payments for legal fees settlement payments or other costs or damages     · obtain a license which may not be available on reasonable terms to sell or use the relevant technology or     · redesign technology to avoid infringement   if we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results        table of contents   programming errors or flaws in our apps could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our apps which would harm our operating results   our apps may contain errors bugs flaws or corrupted data and these defects may only become apparent after their launch particularly as we launch new apps and rapidly release new features to existing apps under tight time constraints further if we utilize application developers in india andor china we believe there is an increased likelihood that our apps may contain errors bugs flaws or corrupted data we believe that if our users have a negative experience with our apps they may be less inclined to continue or resume using them or recommend our apps to other potential users undetected programming errors app defects and data corruption can disrupt our operations adversely affect the experience of our users   our business is subject to a variety of other us and foreign laws many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business   we are subject to a variety of laws in the united states and abroad including laws regarding consumer protection intellectual property export and national security that are continuously evolving and developing the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly laws outside the united states for example laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts unfair competition copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched the ads posted or the content provided by users   if we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability this may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our apps which would harm our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results   if we fail to keep up with technological developments and evolving user expectations we may fail to maintain or attract customers or generate revenues and our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected   we operate in a market characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving industry standards new product and service announcements new generations of product enhancements and changing user expectations accordingly our performance and the ability to further monetize our apps will depend on our ability to adapt to these rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and our ability to continually innovate in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive products there may be occasions when we may not be as responsive as our competitors in adapting our existing software to changing industry standards and the needs of our users   we intend to devote resources aimed at developing new software applications and enhancing our existing software we may not be able to effectively integrate new software applications or enhance our existing software on a timely basis or at all which may decrease user satisfaction with our services such new software applications or enhancements to our existing software even if developed or integrated may not function as expected or may be unable to attract and retain a substantial number of users to use our products our failure to keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving user expectations may cause us to fail to retain or attract users or generate revenues and could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results        table of contents    a relatively small percentage of our apps account for a large portion of our revenue and if we are unable to continue to retain users of such apps or create new profitable apps our revenue could be harmed    a relatively small portion of our apps account for a large portion of our revenue for example historically approximately thirty percent  of our apps accounted for approximately eighty percent  of our revenue if we cannot obtain additional users to purchase our apps our business would be harmed   we may not attain profitability in the future    we expect to make significant investments in growing our business and significantly increase our use of independent contractors which could further reduce our ability to attain profitability in addition as a public company we will incur significant accounting legal and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company as a result of these increased expenditures our ability to become profitable in the future could become more difficult in future periods our revenue could decline or grow more slowly than we expect we also may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons including due to the other risks described in this prospectus and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors accordingly we may not be able to attain profitability and we may continue to incur losses in the future   the past profits and sales related to the apps may not be indicative of future expected sales   due to the nature of app sales there is no guarantee that past revenues correlate with future expected sales there is a possibility that the apps currently owned by the company will not be able to generate any significant future sales if the company is unable to develop additional mobile software applications for smartphones and tablets that generate revenue the company may not be able to generate any revenue   we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors which make our future results difficult to predict   our revenue and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors many of which are outside our control in addition we may not be able to accurately predict our future revenue or results of operations we base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and forecasts and some of our operating costs are to a large extent fixed in the near term as a result we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue and even a small shortfall in revenue could adversely affect financial results for that quarter   becoming a public company will increase our compliance costs significantly and require the expansion and enhancement of a variety of financial and management control systems and infrastructure and the hiring of significant additional qualified personnel   prior to our registered offering of equity securities we have not been subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended exchange act or the other rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec or any securities exchange relating to public companies we are working with our legal independent accountants and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company these areas include financial planning and analysis tax corporate governance accounting policies and procedures internal controls internal audit disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems we expect that we will make significant changes in these and other areas in the near future however the expenses that will be required in order to adequately prepare for being a public company will be material compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies will also require considerable time and attention of management and will also require us to successfully hire and integrate a significant number of additional qualified personnel into our existing finance legal human resources and operations departments        table of contents    our two  employees are only parttime and the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business   we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our two  employees corey wadden and saba mirzaagha although we have entered into employment agreements with both of messrs wadden and mirzaagha these employees are required to devote only ten  hours of working time and attention to our business the initial employment period for messrs wadden and mirzaagha is one  year and thereafter either party may terminate the employment agreement upon sixty  days notice the loss of either of messrs wadden or mirzaagha could disrupt our current apps delay new app development and decrease user retention which would have an adverse effect on our business in addition since our two  employees are only required to devote ten  hours per week to our affairs it may have a negative impact on our business and planned operations further we cannot prevent either of messrs wadden or mirzaagha from terminating their employment with us at any time   in addition messrs wadden and mirzaagha currently provide their services to others in the business of developing marketing and selling mobile applications there can be no assurance that concepts for mobile applications developed by either of them will be presented to the company for consideration   as we grow we cannot guarantee we will be able to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively   we are obligated to pay  of our profits to each of mr wadden and mr mirzaagha as long as they are employed by the company and this may negatively impact our business and results of operations   in connection with the employment agreements the company entered into with each of messrs wadden and mirzaagha the company agreed to pay each of them ten percent   in the aggregate of the company’s profits with “profits” defined as the company’s total revenue minus total expenses on an annual basis while they are employed by the company prorated for partial years the obligation to make such payments to messrs wadden and mirzaagha only lasts as long as each of them are employed by the company and may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations   we are dependent on a single web hosting service provider and any failure or significant interruption in our network could impact our operations and harm our business   we use a single web hosting service provider we do not control the operation of their facilities our web hosting service provider has no obligation to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are unable to renew this agreement on commercially reasonable terms or if our web hosting service provider or its facilities are acquired we may be required to transfer to another web hosting service provider and we may incur significant costs and possible lengthy service interruptions in connection with doing so   problems faced by our thirdparty web hosting service provider with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers including us could adversely affect the experience of our users our thirdparty web hosting service provider could decide to close its facility without adequate notice any financial difficulties such as bankruptcy faced by our thirdparty web hosting service provider or any of the service providers with which we or it contract may have negative effects on our business the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict any changes in thirdparty service levels at our web hosting service provider or any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with our apps could adversely affect our reputation and adversely affect the user experience if our apps are unavailable when users attempt to access them users may stop using our apps interruptions in our apps might reduce our revenue subject us to potential liability or adversely affect our user retention rates   to the extent that our disaster recovery systems are not adequate or we do not effectively address capacity constraints upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate increasing traffic our business and operating results may suffer we do not currently have any insurance and any insurance we may obtain in the future may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses        table of contents    we will need to continue to expand and enhance our network infrastructure to accommodate the growth of our business   we rely on our internal network infrastructure to manage our operations and to provide us with the data we need to analyze the performance of our business and to report our operational and financial performance accurately we plan to invest in expanding and enhancing our network systems which could involve additional purchases of computer hardware and software as well as the hiring of additional operations personnel we may not be able to successfully install and implement any new computer hardware and software needed to enhance our operational systems and we may not be able to attract a sufficient number of additional qualified operations personnel if we are unable to successfully expand and enhance our network infrastructure and operational systems or experience difficulties in implementing such systems our business could be harmed   catastrophic events may disrupt our business   our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires floods power losses telecommunications failures cyber attacks terrorist attacks acts of war human errors breakins and similar events additionally we rely on our network data centers and thirdparty infrastructure and enterprise applications internal technology systems and our website for our development marketing and operational support activities in the event of a catastrophic event we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions reputational harm delays in our software development lengthy interruptions in our services breaches of data security and loss of critical data all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results   security breaches could harm our business   security breaches have become more prevalent in the technology industry we believe that we take reasonable steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect use store and disclose but there is no guarantee that inadvertent eg software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee error or malfeasance or other factors or unauthorized data access or use will not occur despite our efforts although we have not experienced any material security breaches to date we have in the past experienced and we may in the future experience attempts to disable our systems or to breach the security of our systems techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to personal information confidential information andor the systems on which such information are stored andor to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target as a result we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures   if an actual or perceived security breach occurs the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and users andor suffer other negative consequences to our business a security breach could adversely affect the user experience and cause the loss or corruption of data which could harm our business financial condition and operating results any failure to maintain the security of our infrastructure could result in loss of personal information andor other confidential information damage to our reputation and user relationships early termination of our contracts and other business losses indemnification of our users financial penalties litigation regulatory investigations and other significant liabilities in the event of a major thirdparty security incident we may incur losses in excess of their insurance coverage further we do not have insurance currently and certain incidents that we can experience may not be covered by any insurance that we may carry in the future   if we fail to maintain our brand or further develop widespread brand awareness costeffectively our business may suffer   we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a costeffective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our apps and attracting new users brand promotion activities may not generate consumer awareness or increase revenue and even if they do any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand in addition our brand can be harmed if we experience adverse publicity for our apps for any reason including due to “bugs” outages security breaches or violations of laws if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses we may fail to attract or retain user necessary to realize a sufficient

states securities laws enforce united states judgments in a chinese or canadian court based on the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws or bring an original action against

stock   our common stock is and will be subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness   shares of our common stock are common equity interests in us and as such will rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities additionally our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries’ liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors   because we may be subject to the “penny stock” rules you may have difficulty in selling our common stock    our common stock may be subject to regulations of the sec relating to the market for penny stocks penny stock as defined by the penny stock reform act is any equity security not traded on a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than  per share the penny stock regulations generally require that a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith be delivered to purchasers of penny stocks and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the brokerdealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement prior to the sale in addition the brokerdealer must make certain mandated disclosures including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid offer quotations as well as the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons the regulations applicable to penny stocks may severely affect the market liquidity for your common stock and could limit your ability to sell your securities in the secondary market   the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock which could depress the price of our shares   finra has adopted rules that require brokerdealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer prior to recommending speculative lowpriced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status and investment objectives among other things under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability such speculative lowpriced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers thus finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares have an adverse effect on the market for our shares and

objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs in addition because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future

liabilities   level   – observable inputs other than level  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   level   – unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or

the apps have been updated to the latest available android  marshmallow version but future updates could break some functionalities with each android update some of our apps’ functionalities become unusable and we must then update our apps to cure such broken functionalities typically users of android devices download new operating systems a slow pace and therefore it is anticipated that it will take at least  years for the effects to be realized  workability we cannot guarantee that we can make all of our apps will work with all versions of android devices therefore we must predict how our customer base will adopt new android operating system versions and modify our apps to work with the highest percentage of its customers’ devices company description we were originally organized as a
