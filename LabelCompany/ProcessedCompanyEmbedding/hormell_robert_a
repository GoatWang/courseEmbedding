cooked to perfection but that was half the can getting smaller if i wanted i could have cooked the whole can it is good date published  rated  out of  by robert from very good this is the only brand of corned beef hash i will buy it is consistantly delicious even though its from a can dont be fooledthis is good stuff date published  rated  out of  by cindyw from i bought a bad batch maybe i have bought this for years and never had a problem until today i was actually able to poor the hash into the skillet  cans i knew it wouldnt fry up i dont know what happen it is normally very firm as you need a spoon to get it out of the can it was more like hash soup i will still buy this in hopes that it doesnt turn out like this again date published  rated  out of  by mvoss from bad batch normally your hash is wonderful but today opened up two cans and they were totally mushy not packed tight like usual both cans went down the drain they wouldnt fry up numbers on the lid are estw boes we will continue to buy this product but thought you would want to know about it date published  rated  out of  by fed up from unable to open multiple cans by far best tasting hash ive tried however lately i
