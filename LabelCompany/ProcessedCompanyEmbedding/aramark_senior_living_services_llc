gas station restaurants shops and spaces for professional services plus approximately  acres of commercial space is envisioned at esencia for such uses as retail shops and services restaurants professional offices and more cfdsmelloroosother fees will residents of esencia be assessed cfd or melloroos fees if so how much is the assessment as background community facilities districts cfds are established by cities counties and local government agencies as a means of obtaining taxexempt funding through the sale of bonds for the constructionimprovement of public facilities and key infrastructure including streets water systems sewage and drainage facilities schools public parks as well as police and fire facilities which serve newly developing areas today government agencies serving the vast majority of new masterplanned communities in california have found that cfd funding is beneficial to homeowners because it facilitates the early construction of essential public facilities and improvements as well as reduces home prices and down payments by financing essential public facilities and improvements at taxexempt interest rates over a long period of time instead of adding the cost of these improvements to the price of each new home whywhen prior to the passage of california proposition  in  federal funding for key infrastructure was substantial and local property taxes were commonly  and increasing as home prices skyrocketed however starting in  prop  restricted property taxes to just  of assessed home values and allowed only  increases in assessed value per year – just as significant population increases were occurring and federal funding to california for new infrastructure funding was declining as a result cashstrapped cities counties and government agencies were forced to find new ways to fund new schools and other public facilities and improvements to meet the needs of the state’s growing population led by california senator henry j mello dwatsonville and california assemblyman mike roos dlos angeles the community facilities act commonly called melloroos was enacted by the california state legislature in  this legislation allowed the formation of cfds how at esencia on the ranch determination of each home’s cfd tax aka melloroos tax is based on the type of the home and its square footage the cfd tax formula sets the amount of the cfd tax for each home even before it’s purchased and the tax is then included in each new home’s property tax bills or added to impound accounts the overall total annual property tax rate paid by a new homeowner within a cfd includes the  of assessed value per prop  plus any existing governmentissued bonds plus the cfd tax and all other property tax assessments combined that total annual property tax rate is targeted to not exceed  of the assessed value of the property and can be adjusted upward each year by  whowhere at esencia on the ranch a cfd was formed to fund a wide range of public projects including the following the construction purchase modification expansion andor improvement of certain roadways and roadway improvements including without limitation the foothill transportation corridor improvements and the south county roadway improvement program – scrip tunnels regional hiking and biking trails storm drains water and wastewater facilities including without limitation domestic and nondomestic water facilities wells reservoirs pipelines storm and sewer drains and related infrastructure and improvements wet and dry utilities bridges and pedestrian bridges parks traffic signals school facilities and equipment sheriff’s substations and equipment and library facilities and equipment and related infrastructure improvements both onsite and offsite and all appurtenances and appurtenant work in connection with the foregoing including utility line relocations and electric gas and cable utilities the overall total annual property tax rate paid by new esencia homeowners within this cfd will be approximately  of the base home prices for owners of homes in the  gavilán® neighborhoods and approximately  of the base home price for all other esencia homeowners base home prices do not include any home upgrades andor view premiums this total annual property tax rate will include the  base per prop  plus any existing governmentissued bonds plus cfd taxes and all other property tax assessments so cfd taxes will be a portion of the overall annual property tax rate which is expected not to exceed  for  neighborhoods or  for all other neighborhoods at esencia comparecontrast that means that esencia residents could pay as little as approximately  annually and as much as approximately  annually in cfd taxes – with the bulk of residents paying between approximately  and  annually as a point of comparison homebuyers in one of the newest areas of irvine are paying an average of  annually in cfd taxes while those residing in the newest neighborhoods along the san clemente coast are paying an average of  in cfd taxes esencia neighborhood homebuilders are required to disclose to homebuyers their maximum cfd taxes prior to purchase neighborhood homebuilders also can provide information about how to prepay the esencia cfd taxes please consult your financial advisor or cpa for all tax advice are there additional fees assessed for maintenance of the village and more a fee is collected on initial home sales by neighborhood homebuilders and on the resale of all ranch homes to fund an important community services organization

transportation demands associated with esencia and future residents on the ranch the south county road improvement program or scrip phases the funding and construction of numerous transportation improvements with new development on rancho mission viejo and possibly other development areas in south orange county as needed under scrip several new improvements have already been made to help address roadway and traffic conditions in the sendero area including the following widening of sections of ortega highway antonio parkway and la pata road installation of drainage facilities water quality improvements and additional underground utilities construction of a new ft long twolane bridge with barrier railing over san juan creek stabilization of the creek edge to secure trail and maintenance access for county use scrip is administered by orange county public works cow camp road also included in the county of orangeapproved scrip plan is cow camp road designated in the county of orange master plan of arterial highways as an eastwest major and primary arterial highway slated to be built in two phase cow camp road will ultimately provide three lanes in each direction for a total of six lanes beginning at antonio parkway and extending four miles to the east where it will connect with ortega highway near caspers wilderness park the first phase nearly  miles of cow camp road is now open from antonio parkway to a location near the future intersection of los patrones parkway at the eastern edge of esencia key to the first phase of cow camp road has been the design engineering and construction of the chiquita canyon bridge which spans  linear feet long and rises  feet above the protected open spaces of chiquita canyon in addition to affording quick access to esencia cow camp road will benefit local residents by providing alternative routes to existing arterials including ortega highway and the i freeway as well as quick access to the sr toll road aka the ftc or foothill toll roadtransportation corridor at oso parkway via the future construction of los patrones parkway los patrones parkway connecting cow camp road to the sr toll road not included in scrip yet identified as part of the county of orange’s approved transportation program for rancho mission viejo is los patrones parkway formerly known as “f” street identified as a secondary arterial linking cow camp road to the current oso parkway terminus of the sr toll road aka ftc or foothill toll roadtransportation corridor the transportation corridor agencies has announced its intention to place a toll charge on los patrones parkway between cow camp road and oso parkway extension of la pata road  toll road to i freeway connection the extension of la pata road from ortega highway south to avenida vista hermosa is now open this new route will establish an important south orange county parallel to the i freeway allowing commuters to bypass the i as they travel from as far north as rancho santa margarita via antonio parkway and south to la pata and san clemente where they can connect to the i freeway from avenida vista hermosa in addition the future construction of los patrones parkway would establish a new “toll road to freeway” network starting from the current terminus of the sr toll road and heading south along los patrones parkway to cow camp road and then south again along antonio parkwayla pata road to avenida vista hermosa water wise as ranchers developers and stewards of one of the largest land reserves in the state of california procuring a regular supply of water is essential to nearly every operation conducted on the ranch including ranching and farming the management of onsite leases the protection of open spaces on the reserve at rancho mission viejo as well as phased residential and commercial development providing a reliable water supply in  the county of orange approved the rancho mission viejo environmental impact report eir which includes a detailed analysis of the ranch’s water sources current and future projected demand from development and water availability to demonstrate the availability of water supply for average single dryyear and multiple dryyear rainfall conditions in addition analyses were conducted to determine the adequacy of water conveyance andor storage facilities and the certainty of regulatory permitting for developmentrelated projects yet to be implemented santa margarita water district smwd is the urban water supplier identified for rancho mission viejo smwd is a regulated public utility which also serves various cities and the unincorporated territory in southeast orange county rancho mission viejo is wholly within smwd’s service area reducing water demand while today’s new homes use about  less water than most older homes rancho mission viejo continues to lead the housing industry in implementing programs which help reduce water demand through the use of drought tolerant landscaping along with modern irrigation techniques in fact through a partnership between smwd and the rancho mission viejo family a new comprehensive landscape water conservation program was created to reduce the water footprint at each of the villages on rancho mission viejo to date we’ve reduced annual domestic water demand at the villages on the ranch from  acrefeet to about  acrefeet resulting in an overall  reduction waterwise programs to reduce demand approximately  of the common areas at the village of sendero and the four plus neighborhoods of gavilán® as well as nearly  of all common areas at the new village of esencia are irrigated with recycled water due to advancements in efficiency use of drip irrigation and focusing on waterwise landscaping the average residential landscape use on rancho mission viejo is half of that for homes built  years ago weatherbased control timers adjust home irrigation based on local weather changes so that water use is monitored and adjusted based on climate variances and other factors plus the common area irrigation system is controlled by a sophisticated computer program that communicates with onsite weather stations control timers and system sensors to manipulate how long and how often water is provided the use of waterwise planting on rancho mission viejo has increased  to help reduce irrigation demand for example only  of rancho mission viejo common areas use turf grass and the turf grass species on rancho mission viejo is called paspalum which uses  less water than traditional turf has high salt tolerance for use with recycled water and has excellent durability for high traffic use in functional areas – such as parks and village greens slope position and orientation also affect irrigation design and water management for example the north facing slopes on the ranch use  less water than the south facing slopes in addition the bottom of a slope uses  less water than the top of the slope given this there are over  control values to manage water use for the various slope zones at sendero all of the water used for grading is recycled or from nonpotable water supplies thereby avoiding strains on domestic water demand ensuring water quality and preserving wetlands and the watershed preserving downstream water quality protecting the stability of local creeks and watersheds as well as promoting onsite wetlandsriparian habitat protection has been an ongoing priority for the rancho mission viejo family for decades gera on earth day april   the acre gobernadora ecological restoration area gera was created on ranchlands in corporation between the ranch family and the us fish and wildlife service originally established as mitigation for the building of new roads schools and other facilities gera has since become recognized as one of the most successful transformations of former farmlands into wetlands and woodlands scientific study to protect the watershed in  a series of scientific studies on the remaining  acres of rancho mission viejo were expanded to include an us army corps of engineers acoe program to preserve and enhance wetlands manage water runoff and protect water quality in the san juan and santa mateo creeks this research combined with the identification of ranchlands containing native habitat of threatened and endangered animals became the environmental blueprint for the establishment of the reserve at rancho mission viejo and those lands identified for development this research was expanded under leadership of the county of orange and funded by rancho mission viejo to analyze the  square mile watershed of the san juan creek to understand rainfall runoff risk for flooding and effects of erosion riverines and basins in the early s rancho mission viejo began working in partnership with the county of orange smwd the regional water quality control board the ca dept of fish and game the us fish and wildlife service and the acoe on a complex “riverine” system at ladera ranch designed to reduce storm water runoff preserve downstream water quality protect the stability of trabuco creek and promote onsite wetlandsriparian habitat restoration through a narrow mile manmade seasonal creek bed or “riverine” rain water and water from sprinklers pools and other neighborhood sources are collected in a network of drains which are connected to the riverine as it periodically and seasonally fills with water the riverine carries water on a course that passes through specially planted reeds and other flora which serve as natural filters and water purifiers ultimately the water enters the horno basin and the most southern end of ladera ranch for further filtration over its  acres the horno basin includes a water quality control basin and wetland a retarding basin a “smart diversion” system and a forebay for collecting sediment together the riverine and horno basin serves several functions including water quality control trashdebris collection wetlands and habitat restoration water reclamation and storm water detention gera revisited based on the success of ladera ranch’s “riverine” system rancho mission viejo has collaborated with smwd and orange county public works on the new gobernadora multipurpose basin facility upon completion the basin will include multiple storage basins which work together to capture treat and reuse storm water and dry weather urban water runoff from coto de caza once it flows into the gobernadora creek watershed water not diverted for nonpotable water use will be infiltrated into the local groundwater table and sent downstream for sustaining natural riverine areas key to the gobernadora basin facility will be its erosion control system to protect gera and endangered bird species water conveyed into the basin through a naturalized treatment system will be treated as it moves through an acre wetlands which includes vegetation which filters and absorb pollutants and emits oxygen to enhance air quality the use of this natural biological water treatment system will prevent the need for any power use in the treatment process since water will flow from one basin to the next via gravity it also will prevent the discharge of polluted runoff into streams and important habitat areas plus by controlling water flows through the basin excess erosion will be prevented and downstream habitat will be preserved

esencia for such uses as retail shops and services restaurants professional offices and more cfdsmelloroosother fees will residents of esencia be assessed cfd or melloroos fees if so how much is the assessment as background community facilities districts cfds are established by cities counties and local government agencies as a means of obtaining taxexempt funding through the sale of bonds for the constructionimprovement of public facilities and key infrastructure including streets water systems sewage and drainage facilities schools public parks as well as police and fire facilities which serve newly developing areas today government agencies serving the vast majority of new masterplanned communities in california have found that cfd funding is beneficial to homeowners because it facilitates the early construction of essential public facilities and improvements as well as reduces home prices and down payments by financing essential public facilities and improvements at taxexempt interest rates over a long period of time instead of adding the cost of these improvements to the price of each new home whywhen prior to the passage of california proposition  in  federal funding for key infrastructure was substantial and local property taxes were commonly  and increasing as home prices skyrocketed however starting in  prop  restricted property taxes to just  of assessed home values and allowed only  increases in assessed value per year – just as significant population increases were occurring and federal funding to california for new infrastructure funding was declining as a result cashstrapped cities counties and government agencies were forced to find new ways to fund new schools and other public facilities and improvements to meet the needs of the state’s growing population led by california senator henry j mello dwatsonville and california assemblyman mike roos dlos angeles the community facilities act commonly called melloroos was enacted by the california state legislature in  this legislation allowed the formation of cfds how at esencia on the ranch determination of each home’s cfd tax aka melloroos tax is based on the type of the home and its square footage the cfd tax formula sets the amount of the cfd tax for each home even before it’s purchased and the tax is then included in each new home’s property tax bills or added to impound accounts the overall total annual property tax rate paid by a new homeowner within a cfd includes the  of assessed value per prop  plus any existing governmentissued bonds plus the cfd tax and all other property tax assessments combined that total annual property tax rate is targeted to not exceed  of the assessed value of the property and can be adjusted upward each year by  whowhere at esencia on the ranch a cfd was formed to fund a wide range of public projects including the following the construction purchase modification expansion andor improvement of certain roadways and roadway improvements including without limitation the foothill transportation corridor improvements and the south county roadway improvement program – scrip tunnels regional hiking and biking trails storm drains water and wastewater facilities including without limitation domestic and nondomestic water facilities wells reservoirs pipelines storm and sewer drains and related infrastructure and improvements wet and dry utilities bridges and pedestrian bridges parks traffic signals school facilities and equipment sheriff’s substations and equipment and library facilities and equipment and related infrastructure improvements both onsite and offsite and all appurtenances and appurtenant work in connection with the foregoing including utility line relocations and electric gas and cable utilities the overall total annual property tax rate paid by new esencia homeowners within this cfd will be approximately  of the base home prices for owners of homes in the  gavilán® neighborhoods and approximately  of the base home price for all other esencia homeowners base home prices do not include any home upgrades andor view premiums this total annual property tax rate will include the  base per prop  plus any existing governmentissued bonds plus cfd taxes and all other property tax assessments so cfd taxes will be a portion of the overall annual property tax rate which is expected not to exceed  for  neighborhoods or  for all other neighborhoods at esencia comparecontrast that means that esencia residents could pay as little as approximately  annually and as much as approximately  annually in cfd taxes – with the bulk of residents paying between approximately  and  annually as a point of comparison homebuyers in one of the newest areas of irvine are paying an average of  annually in cfd taxes while those residing in the newest neighborhoods along the san clemente coast are paying an average of  in cfd taxes esencia neighborhood homebuilders are required to disclose to homebuyers their maximum cfd taxes prior to purchase neighborhood homebuilders also can provide information about how to prepay the esencia cfd taxes please consult your financial advisor or cpa for all tax advice are there additional fees assessed for maintenance of the village and more a fee is collected on initial home sales by neighborhood homebuilders and on the resale of all

roads and transportation what new roads will be built to meet the transportation demands associated with esencia and future residents on the ranch the south county road improvement program or scrip phases the funding and construction of numerous transportation improvements with new development on rancho mission viejo and possibly other development areas in south orange county as needed under scrip several new improvements have already been made to help address roadway and traffic conditions in the sendero area including the following widening of sections of ortega highway antonio parkway and la pata road installation of drainage facilities water quality improvements and additional underground utilities construction of a new ft long twolane bridge with barrier railing over san juan creek stabilization of the creek edge to secure trail and maintenance access for county use scrip is administered by orange county public works cow camp road also included in the county of orangeapproved scrip plan is cow camp road designated in the county of orange master plan of arterial highways as an eastwest major and primary arterial highway slated to be built in two phase cow camp road will ultimately provide three lanes in each direction for a total of six lanes beginning at antonio parkway and extending four miles to the east where it will connect with ortega highway near caspers wilderness park the first phase nearly  miles of cow camp road is now open from antonio parkway to a location near the future intersection of los patrones parkway at the eastern edge of esencia key to the first phase of cow camp road has been the design engineering and construction of the chiquita canyon bridge which spans  linear feet long and rises  feet above the protected open spaces of chiquita canyon in addition to affording quick access to esencia cow camp road will benefit local residents by providing alternative routes to existing arterials including ortega highway and the i freeway as well as quick access to the sr toll road aka the ftc or foothill toll roadtransportation corridor at oso parkway via the future construction of los patrones parkway los patrones parkway connecting cow camp road to the sr toll road not included in scrip yet identified as part of the county of orange’s approved transportation program for rancho mission viejo is los patrones parkway formerly known as “f” street identified as a secondary arterial linking cow camp road to the current oso parkway terminus of the sr toll road aka ftc or foothill toll roadtransportation corridor the transportation corridor agencies has announced its intention to place a toll charge on los patrones parkway between cow camp road and oso parkway extension of la pata road  toll road to i freeway connection the extension of la pata road from ortega highway south to avenida vista hermosa is now open this new route will establish an important south orange county parallel to the i freeway allowing commuters to bypass the i as they travel from as far north as rancho santa margarita via antonio parkway and south to la pata and san clemente where they can connect to the i freeway from avenida vista hermosa in addition the future construction of los patrones parkway would establish a new “toll road to freeway” network starting from the current terminus of the sr toll road and heading south along los patrones parkway to cow camp road and then south again along antonio parkwayla pata road to avenida vista hermosa water wise as ranchers developers and stewards of one of the largest land reserves in the state of california procuring a regular supply of water is essential to nearly every operation conducted on the ranch including ranching and farming the management of onsite leases the protection of open spaces on the reserve at rancho mission viejo as well as phased residential and commercial development providing a reliable water supply in  the county of orange approved the rancho mission viejo environmental impact report eir which includes a detailed analysis of the ranch’s water sources current and future projected demand from development and water availability to demonstrate the availability of water supply for average single dryyear and multiple dryyear rainfall conditions in addition analyses were conducted to determine the adequacy of water conveyance andor storage facilities and the certainty of regulatory permitting for developmentrelated projects yet to be implemented santa margarita water district smwd is the urban water supplier identified for rancho mission viejo smwd is a regulated public utility which also serves various cities and the unincorporated territory in southeast orange county rancho mission viejo is wholly within smwd’s service area reducing water demand while today’s new homes use about  less water than most older homes rancho mission viejo continues to lead the housing industry in implementing programs which help reduce water demand through the use of drought tolerant landscaping along with modern irrigation techniques in fact through a partnership between smwd and the rancho mission viejo family a new comprehensive landscape water conservation program was created to reduce the water footprint at each of the villages on rancho mission viejo to date we’ve reduced annual domestic water demand at the villages on the ranch from  acrefeet to about  acrefeet resulting in an overall  reduction waterwise programs to reduce demand approximately  of the common areas at the village of sendero and the four plus neighborhoods of gavilán® as well as nearly  of all common areas at the new village of esencia are irrigated with recycled water due to advancements in efficiency use of drip irrigation and focusing on waterwise landscaping the average residential landscape use on rancho mission viejo is half of that for homes built  years ago weatherbased control timers adjust home irrigation based on local weather changes so that water use is monitored and adjusted based on climate variances and other factors plus the common area irrigation system is controlled by a sophisticated computer program that communicates with onsite weather stations control timers and system sensors to manipulate how long and how often water is provided the use of waterwise planting on rancho mission viejo has increased  to help reduce irrigation demand for example only  of rancho mission viejo common areas use turf grass and the turf grass species on rancho mission viejo is called paspalum which uses  less water than traditional turf has high salt tolerance for use with recycled water and has excellent durability for high traffic use in functional areas – such as parks and village greens slope position and orientation also affect irrigation design and water management for example the north facing slopes on the ranch use  less water than the south facing slopes in addition the bottom of a slope uses  less water than the top of the slope given this there are over  control values to manage water use for the various slope zones at sendero all of the water used for grading is recycled or from nonpotable water supplies thereby avoiding strains on domestic water demand ensuring water quality and preserving wetlands and the watershed preserving downstream water quality protecting the stability of local creeks and watersheds as well as promoting onsite wetlandsriparian habitat protection has been an ongoing priority for the rancho mission viejo family for decades gera on earth day april   the acre gobernadora ecological restoration area gera was created on ranchlands in corporation between the ranch family and the us fish and wildlife service originally established as mitigation for the building of new roads schools and other facilities gera has since become recognized as one of the most successful transformations of former farmlands into wetlands and woodlands scientific study to protect the watershed in  a series of scientific studies on the remaining  acres of rancho mission viejo were expanded to include an us army corps of engineers acoe program to preserve and enhance wetlands manage water runoff and protect water quality in the san juan and santa mateo creeks this research combined with the identification of ranchlands containing native habitat of threatened and endangered animals became the environmental blueprint for the establishment of the reserve at rancho mission viejo and those lands identified for development this research was expanded under leadership of the county of orange and funded by rancho mission viejo to analyze the  square mile watershed of the san juan creek to understand rainfall runoff risk for flooding and effects of erosion riverines and basins in the early s rancho mission viejo began working in partnership with the county of orange smwd the regional water quality control board the ca dept of fish and game the us fish and wildlife service and the acoe on a complex “riverine” system at ladera ranch designed to reduce storm water runoff preserve downstream water quality protect the stability of trabuco creek and promote onsite wetlandsriparian habitat restoration through a narrow mile manmade seasonal creek bed or “riverine” rain water and water from sprinklers pools and other neighborhood sources are collected in a network of drains which are connected to the riverine as it periodically and seasonally fills with water the riverine carries water on a course that passes through specially planted reeds and other flora which serve as natural filters and water purifiers ultimately the water enters the horno basin and the most southern end of ladera ranch for further filtration over its  acres the horno basin includes a water quality control basin and wetland a retarding basin a “smart diversion” system and a forebay for collecting sediment together the riverine and horno basin serves several functions including water quality control trashdebris collection wetlands and habitat restoration water reclamation and storm water detention gera revisited based on the success of ladera ranch’s “riverine” system rancho mission viejo has collaborated with smwd and orange county public works on the new gobernadora multipurpose basin facility upon completion the basin will include multiple storage basins which work together to capture treat and reuse storm water and dry weather urban water runoff from coto de caza once it flows into the gobernadora creek watershed water not diverted for nonpotable water use will be infiltrated into the local groundwater table and sent downstream for sustaining natural riverine areas key to the gobernadora basin facility will be its erosion control system to protect gera and endangered bird species water conveyed into the basin through a naturalized treatment system will be treated as it moves through an acre wetlands which includes vegetation which filters and absorb pollutants and emits oxygen to enhance air quality the use of this natural biological water treatment system will prevent the need for any power use in the treatment process since water will flow from one basin to the next via gravity it also will prevent the discharge of polluted runoff into streams and important habitat areas plus by controlling water flows through the basin excess erosion will be prevented and downstream habitat will be preserved maps  rancho mission viejo canyon house
