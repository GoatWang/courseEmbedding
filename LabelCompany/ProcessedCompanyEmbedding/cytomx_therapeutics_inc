therapeutics are designed to bind selectively to tumors and not to healthy tissue to minimize toxicity and create safer more effective cancer therapies traditional antibodies bind to unique antigens that exist in abundance on diseased tissue however many of these antigen targets also are found on healthy tissue this is a critical challenge for today’s highly potent nextgeneration antibody therapies including immunotherapy combinations antibody drug conjugates tcell engaging bispecific antibodies and carnk cell therapies diseased tissue healthy tissue a probody therapeutic solves this problem by binding only to diseased tissue a masking peptide limits binding to healthy tissue thereby minimizing toxicities the improved target selectivity of our probody therapeutics allows us to open a therapeutic window for previously inaccessible targets and to expand the therapeutic index of existing validated targets with this we are transforming the landscape for therapeutic antibodies the probody platforma pioneering antibody prodrug technology designed to localize antibody binding to diseased tissue the probody platform aims to overcome toxicity challenges by creating therapies that are activated selectively in the tumor microenvironment the platform and its resulting probody drugs are based on a deep understanding of protease biology with this technology cytomx is advancing probody cancer immunotherapies and probody drug conjugates toward clinical investigation while also exploring probody technology applications for improved tcell engaging probody bispecifics and procarnk cell therapies our probody platform and pipeline of probody therapeutics are based on a robust portfolio of intellectual property and patented technology  parental antibody  substrate linker stable in vivo in circulation cleaved by tumorspecific proteases masking peptide blocks antigen binding until released once substrate is cleaved producing a fully active antibody proteases dysregulated activity of specific proteases in disease tissue cleaves mask to enable probody binding ihz™ assay demonstrating proteolytic activation and binding of a probody to tumor target in a patient biopsy of non small cell lung cancer about protease biology proteases are enzymes that digest proteins into smaller pieces by cleaving specific amino acid sequences known as substrates in normal healthy tissue protease activity is tightly controlled but in cancer cells protease activity is dysregulated our probody platform leverages this dysregulated protease activity found in the tumor microenvironment a probody therapeutic is engineered with its targetbinding region masked which limits interaction with healthy tissue when probody therapeutics encounter proteases near tumor tissue the proteases remove the mask from the therapeutics the activated probody therapeutic then binds to its target on the tumor localizing the efficacy of a potent antibodybased therapeutic in healthy tissue where protease activity is regulated and minimal our preclinical data suggests that the targetbinding region of the probody therapeutic remains masked and unable to bind scroll to top
