sustainability livable communities and culturemoosonee ontario cgcdmatthew finkbeinermrshughesmap of moosoneemoosonee ontariomatthew finkbeinerdec  courtesy of googlepopulation  urban heiarchythe population of moosonee ontario as of  was  this would place moosonee on the urban hierarchy as a town  village   town   the population of moosonee is  cree with the first language being english and cree as a second language although there is a small french population within the town locationsite the physical location of moosonee is based upon the hudson bay lowlands and is just off of the moose river in a swampy inletsituation there were plentiful resources of which included animals and just natural wildlife settlements and transportation found surrounding moosonee are quite sparsely spread out however there are two settlements within relative proximity to moosonee which are kashchewan and moose factory island moose factory island can be reached by ferry and by ice road in the winter moosonee is not connected to any main roads within ontario and the only ways to reach moosonee are by train or plane making it a difficult destination to reachrelative location the only relative locations to moosonee are kashchewan and moose factory located in north eastern ontarioabsolute location the absolute location of moosonee ontario is at latitude n longitude whistorythe original inhabitants of moosonee were of the wood cree nations of northern ontario they were attracted to moosonee by the access to the mouth of the moose river which leads into james bay also that they had the ability to trade with the james bay creethe original function of moosonee when the wood cree had ownedthe settlement well was as a settlement for the wood cree acting as a post as well as a settlement when the europeans took over the settlement in  when annie hardisty settled there settled as a trading post in  by revillon freres company to establish a tradingfur post with direct competition in mind with the hudson bay co later bought out by hbc the revillon freres trading fur post is still standing today the settlements current function is to be a startinglaunching point for anyone going further up north or to other destinations connected to the ice road in the winter to further people up northvegetationthe vegetation region which moosonee belongs to is the boreal and taiga forestsince moosonee is below the tree line there is plentiful amounts of coniferous trees in this areasuch as alders  willows  black spruce  tamaracks coniferous forests are plentiful in this area due to the peat landsoilmoosonees soil region is wet climate soils soil in moosonee is composed of a thin hummus layer and has an interesting soil profile the soil in moosonee is rich in both iron and aluminum oxides due to the parent material of which is composed of iron and aluminum as well as mafic igneous bedrockwildlifethe wildlife in moosonee is plentiful there are so many magnificent creatures which live in northern ontario and some reside in moosonee large mammals such as caribou mule deer mountain goat and of course mooseaviary species canadian loon many species of hawks and eagles heron etcthere are to many animals to name as well as insects so you could say there is a lot of wildlife in the northclimatethe climate region where moosonee is located is within the taiga region moosonee has a long winters some even lasting longer than  months therefore receiving short summersthey receive an annual precipitation of about mm moosonee has a continental polar climate cp receiving this from james bay hudsons bay and the arctic itselfmoosonee has a temperature range of  degrees celsius  making moosonee have a continental climatelandform and rock typesthe land form region of which moosonee was settled upon was the hudson bay arctic lowlands one of the largest lowlands in all of the world the rock types found in this region are sedimentary created by all the sediments carried by the glaciers in the last ice age the other rock type is ancient igneous underneath the layers of sedimentary the igneous is apart of the canadian shield one of the oldest landforms in all of the worldnatural resourcesathe primary natural resource in moosonee is forests in northern ontario softwood trees such as spruce tamarack cedar and pine are abundant since they can survive in cold harsh climates there are no significant natural resources in moosonee other than forests because moosonee sits in an area of which there are no obtainable valuable metallic minerals as well as an area not suitable for agriculture because of the harsh weather and soilsbmoosonees economic base is not dependent upon forests as a natural source of revenue because of the transportation and milling of wood the closest pulp and paper mill is in timmins but since there are means of transporting any wood because there are no roads to moosonee  meaning to get the wood to a paper mill the wood would have to be delivered by rail to timmins which would be time consuming and costly so in conclusion forests are not significant to the economic base of moosoneefaqs what is moosonees primary natural resource how important is this resource to the settlements economic base  from industrial companieswhat does sustainability and livable communities meansustainability development of which meets the needs of the present without affecting negatively future generations to meet their needslivable communities the means of bringing common needs in an accessible manner to the general public like say at distance from where they live to the grocery store to bring more culture to the community as wellhow would you implement smart growth and sustainability in moosoneei would plead for the town council of moosonee to incorporate a smarter action plan for the people of moosonee to provide a larger industrial commercial industry in the community to promise a stronger economy in the area as well as easier and cheaper access to common needs for the people of moosonee such as a closer presence to a grocery store from a denser population district within the communityprovide more access to the rest of ontario with a main road to reach the town easier cheaper and less of a hassle to receive transported items culturethe culture in moosonee may be perceivable as a community which is not diverse but has a lot of incorporated culture in the town such as the wood cree nations a cultural activity of which i recommend is visiting the rail car museum on first street this museum is only open in july and august yet is quite the experience considering this was one of the original ways to reach moosonee by the rail cars in the museum or visit the tidewater provincial park ran by the municipality of moosonee the park is filled with wildlife and well adventurein conclusion moosoneemoosonee is an amazing town of which it may be quaint yet it gives you a small town feel in the great white north since the town is secluded from the rest of ontario it can only be reached by two different modes of transportation giving you the adventurous feeling of a secluded area you also get the feeling of touching the edge of the arctic which is cooler than you think if you arrive in moosonee during the winter you could travel farther up north to kashchewan or even farther there are many beautiful places to visit such as tidewater provincial park one of canadas most beautiful parks moosonee is a wonderful place come visit anytimefull transcriptmore presentations by matthew finkbeiner
