are primarily the result of moodys analysis that indicates that the tranches will not pay off by their final maturity dates under some or all of  cash flow scenarios thus causing the tranches to incur expected losses that are higher than the expected loss benchmarks set in moodys idealized cumulative expected loss rates table for the previous ratings the low payment rates on the underlying securitized pools of ffelp student loans are driven primarily by persistently high levels of loans to borrowers in nonstandard payment plans including deferment forbearance and incomebased repayment ibr as well as by the relatively low rates of voluntary prepayments the downgrades of class b notes in slm student loan trust   and  also reflect significant excess spread compression under some or all of  cash flow scenarios because these transactions have a significant portion of auctionrate securities or resetrate notes whose coupon rates increased as a result of failed auctions or failed remarketing respectively their excess spread has declined considerably under some or all of our scenarios these transactions would pay out more interest than the underlying collateral generates which would then erode the collateral base and cause the transactions to become undercollateralized as a result the class b notes may not be fully repaid by their final maturity dates for transactions with exposure to cross currency swaps moodys incorporated the risk of additional losses on the notes in the event that they become unhedged following a swap counterparty default moodys also took into account structural features of the transactions that may reduce the impact of such disruption the downgrades of some lowest payment priority class a notes result in these notes being rated lower than the subordinated class b notes in the affected securitizations although transaction structures stipulate that class b interest is diverted to pay class a principal upon default on the class a notes moodys analysis indicates that the cash flow available to make payments on the class b notes will be sufficient to make all required payments to class b noteholders by the class b final maturity dates which occur much later than the final maturity dates of the downgraded class a notes the upgrades and confirmations are primarily the result of moodys analysis that indicates that these tranches are either likely to successfully pay off by their maturity dates or that the expected loss for each such tranche is lower than or consistent with respectively the expected loss benchmark levels set in moodys idealized cumulative expected loss rates table for the previous ratings the confirmation of class a in slm student loan trust  and the upgrade of class b notes in slm student loan trust  and  also reflect the correction of an error in calculating the amount of investment earnings on cash residing in each transactions collection account before each distribution date in our may   and june   actions we mistakenly assumed that interest collections from each of the collateral loan pools for these transactions generate zero investment earnings when in fact they generate investment earnings at the same rate as principal collections from the collateral loan pools as a result of the correction cash available for distribution on each distribution date has increased and the expected loss for these tranches has reduced to a level consistent with for class a in slm student loan trust  or lower than for the class b notes in slm student loan trust  and  the expected loss benchmark levels set in moodys idealized cumulative expected loss rates table for the previous ratings in its rating actions moodys also considered navients demonstrated willingness and ability to protect the securities from being in default as of their final maturity dates specifically navient has consistently exercised its option to purchase all remaining student loans from the trusts at or below the  pool factor and pay off the notes navient has also amended  transactions to add the ability to purchase an additional  of the initial pool balance in the event that navient does not exercise the option to purchase the loans at  pool factor the indenture trustee may initiate a sale of the underlying student loan pools which will take place only if proceeds from the sale will be sufficient to pay off all outstanding notes navient has also amended some transactions to establish a revolving credit facility that enables the trust to borrow money from navient corporation on a subordinated basis in order to pay off the notes finally navient amended  transactions to extend maturity dates for tranches that appeared to have significant risk of not paying off within the previous final maturities todays actions reflect moodys assumption that the events giving rise to nonrecurring fees and expenses that the indenture trustee might sustain as a result of litigation or other unforeseen circumstances are not likely to occur during the term of the transactions as evidenced by historical experience in the transactions backed by ffelp student loans therefore moodys has not included such fees and expenses in its cash flow modeling analysis to account for a small probability of such events however moodys qualitatively assessed sufficiency of the cash flows to pay the trustees nonrecurring fees and expenses this analysis focused in particular on estimating the amount of residual cash flows generated by the pools of student loans after their balance declines to  of the initial balance  pool factor at which time the pools are expected to generate significantly diminished amounts of cash to cover those nonrecurring fees and expenses the principal methodology used in these ratings was moodys approach to rating securities backed by ffelp student loans published in august  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology up moodys could upgrade the ratings if tranches final maturities are extended the paydown speed of the loan pool increases as a result of lower than expected borrower usage of deferment forbearance and ibr higher than expected voluntary prepayment rates or prepayments with proceeds from sponsor repurchases of student loan collateral moodys could also upgrade the rating owing to a buildup in credit enhancement or an improvement of the credit quality of the swap providers down moodys could downgrade the ratings if the paydown speed of the loan pool declines as a result of lower than voluntary prepayments and higher than expected deferment forbearance and ibr rates which would threaten full repayment of the classes by their final maturity dates moodys could also downgrade the rating if the protection from navient is not materialized within a reasonable time frame or the credit quality of the swap providers deteriorate in addition because the us department of education guarantees at least  of principal and accrued interest on defaulted loans moodys could downgrade the ratings of the notes if it were to downgrade the rating on the united states government regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form in rating this transaction moodys used a cash flow model to model cash flow stress scenarios to determine the extent to which investors would receive timely payments of interest and principal in the stress scenarios given the transaction structure and collateral composition moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring

class aa affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class ab affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class b downgraded to bbbsf from asf outlook stable fitch has increased its default base case to  from  due to underperformance compared to original expectations in recent years and the expectation that this negative trend will continue in the near future as a result the class b notes fail fitchs a credit stress scenario key rating drivers us sovereign risk the trust collateral comprises  federal family education loan program ffelp loans with guaranties provided by eligible guarantors and reinsurance

default rate of  and a  default rate under the aaa credit stress scenario which is based on fitchs default model and reflective of recent actual performance the claim reject rate is assumed to be  in

stresses is  ttm levels of deferment forbearance incomebased repayment prior to adjustment and constant prepayment rate voluntary and involuntary are    and  respectively and are used as the starting

operational capabilities daytoday servicing is provided by navient solutions inc formerly known as sallie mae inc fitch believes navient to be an acceptable servicer due to its extensive track record as the largest servicer of ffelp loans criteria variations under the counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated july   fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness the definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest in are those held in the collection account and the funds can only be invested for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the notes fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned rating sensitivities aaasf rated tranches of most ffelp securitizations will likely move in tandem with the us sovereign rating given the strong linkage to the us sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and sap provided by ed sovereign risks are not addressed in fitchs sensitivity analysis fitch conducted a ce sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions in addition fitch conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different assumptions for the ibr usage and prepayment rate the results below should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome as the transaction is exposed to
