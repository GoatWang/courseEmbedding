steven f goldstone chairman and ceo rjr to the washington press club remarks of steven f goldstone chairman and ceo rjr nabisco to the washington press club april   washington dc   i appreciate the invitation to be here today and to take the opportunity to tell you and all the shareholders employees and others with an interest in my company and the tobacco industry where rjr nabisco is today and where we are going from here the hundreds of calls i have been getting over the last week  from investors customers suppliers retailers growers and other interested americans  have only emphasized the need for a clear statement of the situation and the future of rj reynolds our tobacco company in winstonsalem north carolina today it is clear to me that we have failed in our effort to achieve a comprehensive resolution of the contentious issues surrounding tobacco in our country the extraordinary settlement reached on june th last year that could have set the nation on a dramatically new and constructive direction regarding tobacco is dead and there is no process which is even remotely likely to lead to an acceptable comprehensive solution this year by that i mean a comprehensive resolution that sets clear and fair rules for the future but acknowledges that tobacco companies have a legitimate right to exist in our country although i believed on june th as i do now that the comprehensive resolution was a finely crafted solution to seemingly intractable controversies the opportunity to implement it has clearly been lost it is worthwhile to take a moment to review what has happened and then to tell you where our tobacco company is going to go from here i became chairman of rjr nabisco two years ago the company is the sixth largest consumer products company in the world as chairman i am accountable to thousands of shareholders and over  employees all over the world our companies have developed some of the great brands of the world  such as winston camel oreos ritz crackers planters nuts and lifesavers but i found it uniquely difficult to plan for the future when one of our companies is viewed as outside the mainstream of commerce  absorbed in massive litigation under regulatory and political attack with no normal working relationship with federal or state governments it was obvious to me that  years of litigation  in which the industry never lost a case  was nonetheless not providing the best environment for my company and its employees it was obvious to me that further escalation of the war  even with further victories in court  would not change anything for the better  for anybody  for my company the public health community or the country so we sat down at a table with our chief adversaries and members of the public health community the result was a remarkable comprehensive agreement  tougher and more wideranging than any of us had expected  that would have fundamentally changed the way tobacco products are regulated marketed and sold in this country there has been a lot of water over the dam since then but let me remind you what a few people said at that time about the june th settlement the new york times said tobacco negotiators announced a historic settlement proposal today that if ratified promises to change forever the way cigarettes are marketed in the united states to provide billions of dollars in compensation to states and to permanently alter the nations legal regulatory and public health landscape one attorney general who had participated said this is the biggest public health achievement and corporate settlement in the history of this country a leading public health advocate matt myers of the national center for tobacco free kids said this plan offers the best hope for protecting our children he called it the single most fundamental change in the history of tobacco control in the history of the world what has happened since june  well instead of any real consideration of the merits of the settlement washington has rushed to collect more tobacco revenues while playing the politics of punishment  not only destroying the negotiated settlement but threatening to injure farming communities retail store owners and everyone else who participates in this  billion industry as well as every adult who chooses to use tobacco products the comprehensive resolution failed because the administration while publicly praising the concept privately dismantled it piece by piece the resolution cried out for strong bold political leadership but precious little was forthcoming the settlement was instead subjected to partisan positioning the comprehensive resolution failed because some leading public health advocates who seeing the realization of all the programs they had fought for years to obtain and some others they never even dreamed of asking for added a new cry a demand for retribution the comprehensive agreement which should have been a public health advocates dream come true was left behind in favor of a surprising new public health agenda  the need to promote litigation and punitive damages against the industry the comprehensive resolution failed because the congress in the absence of leadership from the administration dissolved into a taxing frenzy on a disfavored industry and the  million customers it serves to be completely honest it failed also because those of us in the industry did not appreciate fully the depth of the mistrust and anger that existed about the industrys past controversies this atmosphere which we had hoped through this settlement to clear eliminated any chance of rational and realistic discussion of the proposal and drowned out virtually all reasonable voices people more interested in the political expediency of acting tough on the industry or in preserving the tobacco controversy for their own political benefit dominated the debate i must say that there were some who did resist the temptation to exploit the politics of the moment senator orrin hatch a longtime leading critic of the tobacco industry after studying the agreement endorsed the essential framework of the comprehensive settlement including liability reforms and acknowledged that realistically unless all the parties who were originally at the bargaining table and who made the settlement possible have some level of acquiescence in the bill    we risk jeopardizing enactment of a program and its successful implementation but the fair process of debate that we and the attorneys general had hoped for ended up instead a process of discrimination and exclusion the bill approved by the senate commerce committee received significant input from interest groups of every shape and variety except from the very industry sought to be regulated we were expressly excluded an industry which is the largest corporate taxpayer in america which provides employment for almost two million americans and which sells a legal product to over  million people was not entitled to be considered it was a chilling reminder that many of our representatives in washington believe that our industry simply has no right to be heard or to participate in the legislative process in the united states congress so now you know why in a nutshell i have concluded that this legislative process as far as tobacco is concerned is currently broken beyond repair why did this political process break down my answer is one word  money  billion is apparently not enough to satisfy all the wishes of the federal government the amount has to be doubled or even tripled to pay for all sorts of new programs unrelated to kids smoking just take a look at the presidents budget submission this year and you get the idea let me be clear on what the commerce committee bill would do although they say it would raise prices by  per pack this is not true the reality is as every wall street analyst has commented the price of cigarettes would be more than doubled or even tripled under the committee bill this would impose costs of hundreds of billions of dollars on adult consumers to fund huge government programs all of this is justified politically in terms of one thing  stopping kids from smoking but remember that less than  of all sales go to underage smokers i do not mean to minimize the problem but the facts are the facts    less than  so this proposal prescribes billions of dollars of tax increases imposed on more than  of a commercial market in a purported attempt to influence  of sales not only that this proposal ignores what every law enforcement officer knows do you know how many packs of cigarettes can fit into one trailer truck  packs that is  million cigarettes it is simply irresponsible to brush aside the problems with black markets that neighboring countries have experienced when they have raised cigarette taxes by even lesser amounts you cannot have effective enforcement of laws limiting access to these products if teenagers are buying cigarettes off the backs of trucks what you may reasonably ask is going on here no one knows definitively why kids smoke or what could be effective in convincing them not to the recent report from the centers for disease control shows a disturbing increase and michael erikson head of cdcs office of smoking and health frankly admits no answer to the question why theres been incredible rhetoric over the past few years he says but very little has changed the negotiators of the settlement realized that there is no one silver bullet that will cause a reduction in underage smoking this is why the settlement included a multifaceted balanced approach to the problem including meaningful laws to limit youth access with real enforcement of them along with voluntary advertising restrictions education programs and gradual price increases of up to  in less than ten years the package included every element ever suggested by mainstream public health experts with an ongoing opportunity to evaluate and adjust the mix as we gained experience as to what would actually work all of this sound thinking has been ignored in the washington debate instead we hear only the calls for greater and greater taxation all for the sake of our children as parents we know that the reasons kids smoke are not related to price in the trendy world of plus sneakers a few dollars to be fashionable or cool apparently are not a problem if people would only listen the kids tell us this themselves the associated press in ohio reported these teenage views two weeks ago if kids want to smoke they are going to do it whatever the cost even if it means stealing said one sixteen yearold its not going to make me quit said another our children have told the congress the same thing at a recent house committee hearing this advice if money were a huge issue then kids wouldnt be buying marijuana said one teenager another teenager was asked do you think raising price would deter some students from smoking no because if you look its kind of weird how    people would be willing to pay   for shoes    and when it comes to cigarettes people will moan theyll groan but theyll still pay the local school professionals know this too cost is not that big a factor most kids have enough money or can get enough to pay more for cigarettes said a principal of an ohio high school remember also for a second where we were before this washington debate took off into financial orbit when the fda regulation was announced in  it did not include anything about price increases not one cent yet the president said we have today met our responsibility to help our country protect its values protect its children and ensure its future david kessler said our regulation focuses on restricting access and reducing the appeal to children    because thats the right public health strategy secretary shalala said that the  fda regulation which i repeat did not involve a penny of price increases was the most important public health initiative in a generation it ranks with everything from polio to penicillin this will be huge in terms of its impact we will reduce the amount of teenage smoking by half over the next seven years    this is a comprehensive approach now just a couple of years later all we hear is taxation taxation price increase price increase as the only possible solution to the problem the one difficulty with todays proposals is that they will destroy the domestic tobacco business and i do not mean just my company they will put growers out of business and destroy many of the communities where they live they will hurt badly the thousands of small retailers across the country they will unfairly burden those adults who do choose to smoke and who can least afford greater taxation you do not have to rely on me on this point just listen to wall streets unanimous view gary black of sanford bernstein called the senate commerce committee proposal last week a  billion proposal from the land of make believe martin feldman of salomon smith barney so where might the us tobacco industry be by  if mccains proposals are legislated the real retail price of cigarettes will exceed  per pack a thriving black market will have developed us farmers and manufacturers will have lost market share to foreign entities and the weaker us companies may have filed for bankruptcy protection the aspirations of the proposed bill    are more likely to be achieved by policy based on compromise and an understanding of industry dynamics than by trying to bludgeon the industry to death david adelman of morgan stanley wrote that politics not policy is unfortunately dominating the settlement process    the proposal would likely force rjr nabisco into bankruptcy    and would quickly result in a very significant black market and will not resolve the nations tobacco issues on top of washingtons urge to use the tobacco controversy as a unique opportunity to raise revenue the debate has also taken on a truly coercive bigbrother tone not only do politicians not think twice about proposing huge tax burdens on adult smokers but the adults of our country apparently cannot be trusted or allowed to exercise their own personal judgment freely ill give you just one example the commerce committee bill in a stroke of a pen would completely eliminate the camel image from my companys packaging this is a trademark reynolds has used for more than  years it is known worldwide yet the committee determines with no debate that a picture of a camel on a pack of cigarettes is too dangerous even for adults to see so i come back to it the legislative process that produced these proposals does not give me any hope that it can produce a reasonable or rational result so where does all this leave us my answer is just about where we were a year ago before we signed the june th agreement although we will undoubtedly incur extra costs and litigation expenses as a result of this failed settlement effort here is what i see first i have told my colleagues in the industry that effective today i no longer see any purpose in working toward the june th national settlement i stand behind the comprehensive resolution embodied in the agreement but i see no possibility in this environment to achieve it as a business enterprise we therefore have to address how our company will go on from here we will be a responsible corporate citizen while growing our tobacco brands and competing for the business of adult smokers we fully accept that the us market is going to continue its overall decline but there is still a lot of room for our company to compete and prosper three out of four adults who smoke choose products other than reynolds products and each point of market share we can obtain through effective communication with this group will be significant for us we have also heard the concerns of the public parents and others who want to take the steps necessary to ensure that tobacco products are not marketed or sold to kids i have testified in congress and i firmly believe that marketing directed at children is not only illegal but immoral and unethical our tobacco company operates today on these principles we will support and work towards achieving reasonable effective and measurable efforts to reduce and eliminate smoking by minors i share a responsibility with the parents of our country to educate our children that they should not smoke it is an adult product with known health risks we dont need the  new federal boards and commissions that would be created by the commerce committee bill to get this message to our children as a parent i do not believe we have to rely on washington to teach our children right from wrong in fact i plan to work with my colleagues in the industry to encourage independent nongovernment controlled efforts to educate our children about the lifestyle decisions children make that so concern us as parents second we knew that we would suffer for our attempt to settle and compromise and that the plaintiffs lawyers would trumpet it as a sign of weakness to solicit even more and more cases against us this has already happened we are facing hundreds more cases than we had just a year ago from lawyers seeking jackpot judgments of every variety but let me assure you  and them  that we are not as they would have it like a brinks truck overturned in the middle of the highway to the lawyers who as reported in the wall street journal last week have been advertising for plaintiffs on latenight tv and producing home videos on how to sue this industry hoping that a huge pot of money would be theirs for the taking i say you have been operating on a wrong assumption we will not stop defending ourselves we continue to have strong defenses to these claims and american juries continue to respect basic notions of personal responsibility and the consequences of free choice we have consistently prevailed in front of impartial jurors and we will continue to do so gambling on a big new inventory of the same old cases is a bet you will not win just a few weeks ago the industry won yet another important case in indiana in which a renowned plaintiffs lawyer presented a full blown case including all the industrys socalled damning documents the jury nonetheless had no problem distinguishing political science from real science and brought in a defense verdict in a secondhand smoke case so i believe the industry should and will continue to win the vast majority of all these cases also we will undoubtedly have to litigate more claims brought by the states seeking medicaid reimbursement  and let me take a moment to remind you what these cases are about the states have for years approved tobacco as a legal product and taxed it to the point of no return they did this knowing the health risks associated with the products and while knowingly granting their citizens the right to choose to smoke the state cases have no merit courts in maryland san francisco washington and west virginia have already thrown out these claims undoubtedly where fair tribunals exist others will follow finally and this is perhaps the most important point going forward we are going to speak out and engage in the public policy debate affecting our industry and our customers i dont mean just this countrys  million smokers i mean the hundreds of farming communities the tens of thousands of small grocers and convenience store owners the truckers distributors suppliers and others  two million in all  who have an economic stake in this industry i pledge to devote much of my own time and my companys considerable resources to fostering a healthy vigorous debate about the choices this country has about tobacco products i have talked to the ceos who lead the other companies in the industry and i have no doubt they will join me in devoting their resources to raise these issues in every town across the country the primary issue is taxation is it fair to increase the tax on cigarettes by huge amounts to pay for new federal spending programs or to provide tax cuts for wealthy americans the commerce committee bill would raise taxes so that washington would make  times more than our tobacco company does on every pack sold that is big business for big government but it is bad business for americans what would this do to real people    and to the family of a smoker who makes  a year by the fifth year it would increase his tax bill by almost  a year  more than he will then pay in federal income taxes it is also bad business for the growers and their farm communities who are our partners taxes this high and the reduction in volume they will cause plus the further restrictions on foreign sales in this bill will crush them too towns like carrolton kentucky wilson north carolina danville virginia or carthage tennessee and it is not just the farmers it is the hardware store owner the farm equipment man the fertilizer distributor the local banker the local insurance agent blake brown a leading agricultural economist sums it up when he says these communities will be devastated these jobs will be lost and not replaced washington does not realize that farmers dont want government handouts and that a farmer welfare program will not even address the problems of the others in the community washington does not remember that these communities care as much about their children as anyone else in the country so we are going to talk to people about all this were also going to talk to them about the intrusion of government into the free enterprise system and the censorship and coercion of individual liberty were going to talk about protecting our constitutional right to advertise market and communicate with adults and protecting the rights of adults in a free society to hear us and make their own personal judgments free from government coercion were going to see if adults want their federal government to censor the images they are permitted to see like that dangerous camel that has been on the front of our package for  years this may all sound simply like political rhetoric to you but i assure you that it is not these are real issues facing real people involved in this business they are issues that could not be more serious to them and to me as a chief executive officer i have a responsibility to them and a duty to my shareholders and employees to do what i can to advance their interests in this commercial enterprise no doubt my words today will be met with more of the same litany of accusations about past misconduct that some people would rather focus on  to the exclusion of any vision for the future but i cannot afford to dwell in that debate i have a business to run in an industry on which millions of people depend we have to move on i have no doubt that when the debate occurs the american people will bring some wisdom and common sense back to these issues in conclusion i cannot tell you how disappointed i am that our effort to reverse years of acrimony and to chart a new direction have failed for now perhaps at some point a real opportunity for a comprehensive resolution will present itself perhaps another opportunity will not arise as events play out over the next few years but we have no possibility for reasonable reform today so we will continue to manage our business in the most responsible and competitive way we can as long as our country continues its longheld view that tobacco products should be legal products available to adults who choose to use them and that private enterprise has a legitimate role in producing these products for those adults then that is exactly the job we intend to do  go to tobacco bbs homepage

the united states goldstone joined rj reynolds in  after having been a corporate attorney in new york for  years q you’ve been quoted in newspapers as saying that under your stewardship you intend to make reynolds uh–to instill a new sense of corporate culture in reynolds do you recall making that statement a actually talk over each other q well is it true a uh mr miley i think that managers today at reynolds understand that that company has to accept responsibility uh and conduct itself in a responsible manner and to that extent i’m satisfied that they are doing that today q mr cosco do you agree that in the past reynolds managers not under your helm have made mistakes that have impacted adversely on public health a i can’t say that mr miley the only thing i–and i know you were going to go through a lot of this but in fairness to me really i’ve been in this company a year and a half i know there are lawsuits surrounding the conduct of this company i talked to my lawyers about it a lot i understanding there are ranging debates in these cases including this one you have in florida but i i don’t have judgments to make i’m not interested in the past that’s something for you and the judges and the juries to figure out for me it’s going forward in the future and how we conduct ourselves in the future q well if you’re going to conduct yourself differently in the future than obviously you’re going to make some changes correct a what is said to you is that we’re going to conduct ourselves responsibly i’d like to think our company conducted itself responsibly in all circumstances in the past but that is what the subject of this litigation in florida’s all about q as the calls came unintelligible a well it’s a it’s a complicated question for me uh and i hope you’ll give me a second q you take all the time you want sir a answer that one for you because um for myself and this is just my own personal opinion i have been in this world for  years i’m not a scientist but i i do believe that uh today that uh cigarette smoking play plays a role in causing lung cancer um and uh i’m in the job i’m in and i believe that uh uh the state of florida the government of the state of florida i think most people on your side of the table i believe the president of the united states and i believe everyone in congress and i believe most americans believe that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and all of those people florida the governor the president the congress has decided against prohibition they’ve decided that american adults with free information and with good information ought to be able to make their own choice politically i personally believe in that i believe in that very much i think it’s one of the most important principles that we have in this country but uh if mr schindler uh–if it became a revelation for him and he decided he shouldn’t uh participate in the business anymore i could understand completely but i i for me today sitting here if a scientist could connect the scientific gaps fill in the scientific gaps that would not be a revelation to me uh that uh cigarette smoking somehow was found to cause cancer um that’s not a shock to me i don’t think it’s a shock to almost any american today so that’s where i am on that i will tell you this um i was watching on cnn this morning and saw some–one of the universities uh one of the scientists thought that they had discovered what it was the mechanism unintelligible cause from smoking to lung cancer and lord knows i hope they do and if they do um these tobacco companies damn well better work like lunatics to figure out how to improve their products i could be it would great for all americans to understand cancer more and i think it would be great for all americans to understand cancer more and i think it would be important for this industry to do that and the other thing mr motley on that is this time this industry will work hand in hand with the government and will work uh cooperatively on terms of medical research but um denying basis uh truths medical truths is not what the industry will do at least not what rj reynolds tobacco company will do q i take it sir then you do accept that cigarette smoking is a cause of disease in humans” goldstone “i will tell you because i’m not a scientist and i respect the views of our scientist in our company who very compellingly explained to me why there are gaps in scientific knowledge but i’ve only been in this company a couple of years i was a smoker myself at one time and i have always believed– rightly or wrongly i have always believed that smoking plays a role in causing lung cancer what that role is i have no idea but i do believe that” motley “so your answer to my question is yes” goldstone “yes sir” httpwwwpbsorgwgbhpagesfrontlineshowssettlement share thissharetwitterfacebookgooglelike thislike loading leave a reply cancel reply enter your comment here fill in your
