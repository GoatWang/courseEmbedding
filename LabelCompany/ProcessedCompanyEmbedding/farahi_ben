foottall grecian columns the sky terrace also maintains a tropical look and contains banks of slot and video poker machines a comfortable lounge oyster bar and sushi bar while clearly appealing to leisure travelers the atlantis also caters to area gaming customers by offering more slot and video poker machines with higher than average payout rates and liberalized rules at blackjack much of the success of the atlantis is due to its location several miles from reno’s downtown casinos and the only hotel within walking distance of the reno convention center which supplies a steady stream of fresh customers monarch traces its history to 7 when the father of the company’s cochairmen david farahi and his brotherinlaw isaac poura bought a rundown room motel called the golden door motel located on four acres of leased property on the southern edge of reno it was well removed from the bulk of the tourist trade that frequented the downtown casinos the facility’s only tangible asset was its close proximity to the city’s convention center which provided enough business along with overflow guests from downtown hotels during peak times to barely keep the enterprise afloat the golden door was a twostory lowrise structure with an adjoining building that housed the lobby a coffee shop banquet room and lounge because it was part of the golden door chain the name was changed to the golden road motel john farahi a political science graduate from california state university hayward soon went to work for the motel and during summer vacations from college he was helped by his brothers bob would earn a biochemistry degree from the university of california at berkeley and ben received a mechanical engineering degree from the university of california at berkeley as well as an mba degree in accounting from california state university hayward over the next several years all three sons would eventually come to work for the business on a fulltime basis poura would not be with the company however the two brothersinlaw proved incompatible business partners and in mid73 david farahi bought out poura in 76 with his sons having taken on so much of the responsibility for running the business he transferred ownership to them and their sister jila farzad naimi june   avid modjtabai june   bijan mossavar rahmani june   nader modanlo june   afshin mohebbi june   mohammad ketabchi
