gold prices are a reflection of the costs associated with meeting the world’s demand for gold from increasingly lower grade deposits at the improbable extents of the planet the trend of the industry to explore higher in the mountains deeper into the jungle and into some of the most politically unstable regions of the world has undoubtedly increased the complexity of business risks which cannot be simply managed by good operators industry publications today are well documenting technically successful programs that have run aground in environments of social unrest uncertain tax and royalty structures and changing regulation good projects in difficult locals ultimately face difficulty attracting capital or partners necessary to continued project development and production dakota territory believes that opportunity is being created by today’s metal prices in much the same way that favorable prices and the application of modern technologies in the ′s generated a renaissance of exploration and mining activity in the historic districts of the united states by capitalizing on known mineral resources that had been previously uneconomic the black hills of south dakota has yielded approximately  million ounces of gold over years of continuous mine production with the gold output of the black hills concentrated in a  square mile area known as the homestake district large districts are the physical evidence of extensive gold systems often with the potential to repeat in proximity despite the evolution of technology over the past century exploration for gold today is largely the same business it has always been in that the search is most commonly restricted to the places where the metal has first been discovered at surface without a gold showing on surface there generally has not been a concerted effort to search for gold under the cover of overlying strata even in the districts where the evidence for hidden deposits supports the case for it exploration for gold deposits under cover can be a difficult proposition requiring extraordinary technical expertise and the substantial investment of upfront capital to narrow the possibilities and focus the search dakota territory resource corp is uniquely positioned by the experience of its management to leverage homestake mining company’s  million dollar investment in the black hills during the ′s and ′s beginning and focused at the point where the previous work left off the black hills of south dakota is a safe low cost jurisdiction known for its rich mining heritage and culture based on generations of mines and miners south dakotan’s understand mining and are proud of the historically significant role that gold has played in local state and regional economies regulatory authorities have consistently demonstrated a willingness to work with responsible operators to permit wellplanned compliant projects and south dakota’s exploration and mining regulations are reasonable and comparable to other jurisdictions within the united states and the throughout the world dakota territory resource corp understands the risks inherent to minerals exploration and believes that opportunity and value are created for its shareholders through both the technical merits of its projects and through the reduction of business risks associated with the location of its properties more  news dakota

territory’s flagship property and is a target for both tertiaryaged and ironformation gold mineralization  the blind gold property is located approximately  miles northwest and on structural trend with the homestake gold mine that having produced approximately  million ounces of gold over its year minelife is historically the largest ironformationhosted gold deposit in the world  technical report – blind gold project june  in the ′s homestake mining company undertook a  million exploration program managed by richard bachman president and chief executive officer of dakota territory that was focused primarily on the search for a repeat of the homestake mine  for the first time this program successfully demonstrated the repeatability of homestake ironformation hosted gold deposits within a structural corridor extending northwest of the mine  significant new gold mineralization was discovered by surface drilling approximately one mile down plunge from the surface expression of the maitland fold structure at a depth of approximately  feet below surface  to provide access for underground exploration development and mining homestake undertook the excavation of a three mile long tunnel from the mine’s  ft level called the “north drift”  as the north drift was being advanced from the mine two surface core holes identified the next in the series of repeating fold structures to the north called the “false bottom” fold structure with classic arsenopyritechloritegold mineralization intersected below the maitland mine area at a depth of approximately  feet below the surface the upplunge projection of this mineralization extends to dakota territory’s blind gold property under the cover of approximately  feet of the younger paleozoic sedimentary  tertiary intrusive rocks isometric view homestake corridor in addition to the exploration potential for gold hosted in homestake ironformation the blind gold property is also located just north of the maitland mine the maitland mine produced both gold and silver from a tertiaryage replacement deposit typical of the district with mineralization hosted in the cambrian deadwood formation  the deadwood formation was the preferred host for tertiaryage gold mineralization in the district and the maitland mine was the last in the string of nine mines that produced ores from the deadwood formation host along a well defined structural trend the maitland mine is located at the point where the deadwood formation disappears under the cover of the paha sapa limestone which also hosts gold deposits within the district but to a lesser degree plan view maintland mine and blind gold property area after heidt   bachman  spokane sme the formation of tertiaryaged goldsilver replacement deposits is generally dependent on fault and fracture structures necessary to the transportation of mineralizing fluids and proximity to the preferential intrusive bodies both of which are present at the blind gold property tertiaryage gold mineralization is evidenced across the property by numerous mapped prospect workings dating from the turn of the century in the paha sapa limestone phonolite intrusive and deadwood formation where it outcrops at the southwest corner of the property  the blind gold property is a high caliber exploration target for the ontrend continuation of tertiary aged goldsilver replacement deposits in the preferred deadwood formation host under the cover of the paha sapa limestone dakota territory’s exploration focus is on the search for a repeat of a homestake ironformation gold deposit on the blind gold property primarily because of the size and grade potential of a deposit of this type and resulting economic opportunity associated with such a discovery  while exploration for other gold deposit types is a secondary priority the exploration program will be opportunistic as each hole drilled through the overlying cover rock holds additional potential for the discovery of tertiaryaged goldsilver replacement deposits cross view blind gold property after heidt  more  news dakota territory resource corp announces high grade gold mineralization at recently

homestake ironformation gold mineralization and is comprised of twentyone unpatented lode mining claims located one mile northeast of the homestake open cut and one mile northwest of the city of deadwood the homestake ironformation is the exclusive host for gold mineralization at the homestake mine that having produced approximately  million ounces of gold over its year minelife is historically the largest ironformationhosted gold deposit in the world city creek geology is dominated by rocks of the homestake stratigraphic sequence including the ellison homestake and poorman formations that outcrop across the property the homestake ironformation outcrop on the city creek property is complexly folded and represents the extension of homestake ironformation northeast from caledonia and main ledge ore bodies at the homestake gold mine the main ledge and caledonia ore bodies outcropped within a relatively small window on surface yet accounted for more than  million ounces of gold production over the life of the homestake mine numerous gold prospect pits and shallow underground workings in quartzveined homestake formation have been located and mapped at city creek and the stratigraphy at the property has also been mapped by both homestake and usgs geologists over the years the city creek property was drilled by homestake mining company in the ’s and ’s which produced intersections of weak gold mineralization in the homestake ironformation in the classic quartz vein chloritearsenopyrite mineralization style of the homestake mine the historic homestake drilling was widely spaced and did not systematically test the northeast extension of the homestake ironformation away from the homestake mine and under dakota territory’s city creek
