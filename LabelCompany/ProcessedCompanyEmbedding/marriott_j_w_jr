additional hotels over the next two to three years creating more than  new jobs in a speech delivered to several hundred executives at the detroit economic club jw marriott jr chairman and chief executive officer of marriott international said with employment rates holding at recordhigh levels recruiting and retaining employees is the greatest challenge facing american business today mr marriott added that while the company has one of the lowest turnover rates in the hospitality industry the companys competitive strength depends upon recruiting developing and retaining highquality associates we invest  million per year on training alone it is a key part of our employment package which is designed to attract and retain the best people how we invest in and manage our human capital today will dictate our success tomorrow mr marriott said an employee searching for a job has just as many choices as a consumer shopping for a product or service just as our customers know that value transcends price we must offer our employees value beyond just compensation mr marriott said the companys human capital strategy focuses on five principles to generate even greater value for employees and the company they include  get it right the first time hire the right person for the right job good managers identify hire and wisely place top talent mr marriott said  money isnt the only thing money is just one component of value and managers must offer the whole package competitive compensation and a great workplace our research shows that while pay is a top concern in decisions to stay or leave other factors combine to outweigh money – such as worklife balance leadership quality career development opportunities and work environment the longer an employee is with us the more important the non monetary issues become mr marriott said  create a caring workplace pay may keep people on the job but it wont motivate them to produce more value for the company or go the extra mile in our industry a genuinely warm caring empathetic workplace is a clear driver of the quality of our product  promote from within we give every associate the opportunity to advance as far as their abilities will take them not only does this help us build longterm leadership it also enables us to perpetuate our culture which provides our company with a sustainable competitive advantage mr marriott noted that more than  percent of the companys current managers have been promoted from within adding employees specifically cite the opportunity for advancement as a key factor in their decisions to stay with marriott  build your brand consumer branding enables us to make a sale to customers who have unlimited choices employment branding enables us to attract potential employees who
