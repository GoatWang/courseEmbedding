g roberts – producing artistic director steppingstone theatre company  it is my belief that the entertainment industry within the realm of tv film and theatre is currently in a state of artistic flux that is to say that the industry is being forced to recognize the human cultural and artistic significance of those individuals who have been  historically disenfranchised due to their not fitting into an “industry type” before founding and becoming the artistic director of steppingstone theatre company a new york city–based notforprofit organization i was both an actor and a teaching artist fresh out of grad school and one year into the new millennium i found myself auditioning booking working and finally—making a living at my craft nothing then was more satisfying to me than believing that it truly didn’t matter what color i was or that i had a visual impairment all i knew was that it seemed as if i was being embraced by the industry and accepted for my differences for why else would i book principal roles on hbo’s oz and sex in the city or national network commercials if i wasn’t indeed being brought into the industry’s fold it did not matter that i was ’” lbs greyeyed blind and black—oh how my eyes were wide shut then as an artist i was taught learned and then taught to others the importance of unearthing the truth universal truths personal truths and artistic truths after leaving grad school i was filled with warm fuzzies about “the business” and was prepared to share me and my craft with the world what i didn’t know was that those warm fuzzies that i found security in would later give way to some harsh realities of “the business” one of the major realities is based and revolves around the dollar “talent” much less talent with a disability is the last component considered for any greenlighted project what seems to be most important to the producing “powers that be” is the commercialibility of any entertainment endeavor simply put it comes down to what the powers that be erroneously believe will only make money unfortunately there are those in the industry who are supremely ignorant to the vast untapped resources of disabled people who collectively have immense financial viability what does the public want to see is a question best answered by truly holding the mirror up to nature not what a select few think nature should be what will the public pay to see perhaps vibrant unapologetically human stories stories that have remained untold and may not quite fit the cookiecutter mold moreover the current industry is answering its own questions by thinking it must create archetypes that they believe will secure popular and monetary success before securing artistic integrity alas i was not armed with this vital information in fact after having some success and booking a number of mainstream gigs more and more auditions were offered to me however something had changed something was different it seemed as if i had reached a glass ceiling in “the business” was my previous success a fluke or was there a tangible reason why i wasn’t even getting callbacks for what were then highprofile auditions i was forced to question the industry’s acceptance and embracement of me were the reasons why i booked the roles i did based on superficial needs of the advertisers or individual shows was looking blind the only criteria for booking a particular gig was being the “big scary black dude” the perfect guy for the role did having talent matter  was knowing and working on your craft enough these unanswerable questions plagued me for a time on march   two days before my nd birthday i had a very awakening audition after giving what was i thought a solid reading for a pilot and being video taped liz a casting director from a major new york city casting office did something that was most unusual i don’t know if it was that she felt a connection with me because we spoke as people or that she felt sorry for me or she had a minute of weakness and chose to be open if only for a moment but the information she shared with me forever changed my view and understanding about the industry as i sat in her chair voices echoed in my head “man i think you booked it i think you booked it” but nothing could have been further from the truth she looked at me and said “chris you’re one of the finest actors i saw today if not the best but this spot will not go to you” she then went on to ask what was wrong with my eyes after freely telling her why my eyes were grey and what visual limitations i had she went on to tell me the following “chris frankly you look good on film but people would have too many questions about your eyes and when you wear glasses you can’t even see your eyes” after the moment hit me and the knot fell from my throat and began to fall deeper into my stomach i asked “does it really matter” with all sincerity she said “for these producers it does you’re just not what they see when they think of a lead” momentarily shattered i said “thank you i understand” when really i didn’t and left as if i needed to be constantly reminded of this new painful realization several days after that march afternoon i continued to audition i went on audition after audition with a much keener understanding of how i was being perceived by the industry i was able to detect behavioral patterns from those who were uncomfortable by my vision or the color of my eyes if ignorance is bliss then there are those in the industry who truly live in the garden of eden i then realized that it perhaps wasn’t a personal affront to me or that they didn’t like my skills as an actor but rather they wanted what they thought would guarantee them a hit or some type of commercial success and in their narrow uninformed view of the world a person who is blind or with any disability could not help secure that kind of monetary success i tentatively shared my discovery with my agent and told her flat out “not all blind people can play piano and sing like a bird” i went on to say “please submit me for anything that is right for me despite my vision” ann smiled and said “chris you’re a sweetheart but i’ll only submit your headshot for those projects where you can wear sunglasses or the role is exactly your type” she went on to say “chris it costs money to send these out let’s try to send it out to the ones you’ll have a chance at” sorely dissatisfied with that answer i said “sure” i knew then that i would have to fearlessly forge my artistic career in the fires of my sheer determination as i got on the elevator i realized that the industry sees me in one particular light and accepts me only in certain conditions it has become evident to me that for true diversity in the industry to occur it must be able and willing to accept its artists and their imperfections for it is those imperfections that make us all human the industry must be willing to represent the human experience in all its colors not only the ones we find comforting but the ones that make us think pause and hesitate to speak furthermore the industry has overlooked a huge crosssection of people in america there are more than  million disabled individuals this market has yet to be tapped additionally time is ushering along one of the richest generations ever—“the babyboomers”—into a place where every day more and more of them are finding themselves with agerelated ailments that shift them into being a person with a disability those who are disabled directly reflect the values of the society in which they live the industry has a responsibility not only to entertain but to accurately and truthfully represent its populace of course there are no easy answers to questions that have lingered in the entertainment industry for decades but within recent years there have been significant and slightly encouraging milestones that have taken place in the industry though encouraging the industry cannot and must not rest on its laurels whether the last comic standing has a disability or an adored actor who has parkinson’s is still working on television whether the lead for a romantic comedy is blind or the popular show law  order criminal intent hires a large number of actors who are deaf for a recent episode there must be more the industry has got to consistently go beyond an antiquated mindset of how it views people with disabilities it is imperative that the industry overcome its ignorance and fear of those whom they do not know or understand whether they know it or not we are them and they are us there are more things that make us alike than make us different moreover those differences should be celebrated and amplified lifted up not put on the back shelf until it suits the purpose of a particular entertaining whim the industry can retain artistic integrity by maintaining the intrinsic humanity of the art form and in so doing monetarily capitalize on the celebration of humanity in its varied forms return to national diversity forum main page video tweets by inclusionarts recent casting society  inclusion join forces for town hall september  commentary in the uk and us bias infects theatre reviews actors with disabilities are you in our files   alliance for inclusion in the arts a devoted black father is denied the right to parent his own children  because he is blind  fans and followers     home find a job directory health tips advertise  submit news monday may   a devoted black father is denied the right to parent his own children — because he is blind — defying sterotypes then shot down by a biased judge — christopher g roberts a blind father and his children playing in the park new york ny — the right of the natural parent to the care and custody of his or her child is considered a fundamental right in the united states in spite of that a new york kings county supreme judge in brooklyn has slammed the door on an american father’s right to parent is own children – solely it seems because he is blind the judge in this case would insert “able” and in particular “sighted” in front of “natural parent” “no vision no children” sums up the court’s decision upturning decades of civil rights progress and common sense despite christopher g roberts serving as his son and daughter’s primary caretaker when he found himself in front of justice eric i prus the judge informed him that because the children were young then  and  and mr roberts was blind – the judge was concerned about the children being “protected from any hazard” the judge told mr roberts that it was important for “someone to be there” asserting that mr roberts was less than a full person not quite a “someone” in the judge’s eyes remarkably the judge conditioned mr robert’s time with his children be supervised by a sighted nanny who mr roberts was to hire at his own expense even though mr roberts was once a primary caretaker the judge chose to allow him a scant seventeen  hours of time with his children – and then with each second “supervised” such is the horror that unfolded on may th  though we have become accustomed to – and even desensitized to – custody disputes as  of us marriages end in divorce in this case there was no mudslinging in may in fact mr roberts’ wife never even had to testify nor say a word that day nor were there any records by any agency be it social services or the police nor from the children’s pediatricians or teachers suggesting that mr robert’s children had ever been endangered because their father was blind interestingly enough mr roberts was a highly soughtafter teacher in the arts where he has taught over  children from preschool through th grade in the nyc area instead of needing judicial rescue mr robert’s children were both well caredfor gifted living in park slope attending private preschool – a lifestyle provided for by their blind father nonetheless the judge ordered “family intervention” sending social services to the home – they found nothing – and ordered all of the children’s time with their father be “supervised” by a sighted nanny had mr roberts been unable to pay for a sighted nanny he would have been unable to see his children – the children he had been raising – at all somehow the fact that tens of thousands of blind parents raise their children every day without “sighted supervision” was lost to the judge it is hard to tell how mr roberts’ race black and gender as the father not the mother played into his biased decision perhaps stereotypes about all of these traits continues to play a hand in this case the worldview undergirding the view that blind people are not capable of parenting takes us back to a dark time of us history where eugenics and moral laziness prescribed involuntary sterilization for those persons deemed “lesser than” not fully “someone” still in  laws have had to be proposed from new york to south carolina to ensure that blind parents’ children are not denied their natural parents even as an estimated  million parents with disabilities raise their children to ensure that blind parents’ children are not denied custody because they are unsighted laws have been proposed in a number of jurisdictions in the ny state legislature in  new york bill a was introduced by then assemblymember joan millman to revise the family court act to prohibit custody decisions solely on the basis of blindness after the bill was introduced it was referred to the judiciary where no further action was taken also in  assembly member barbara clark introduced bill a to revise new york’s domestic relations law to likewise prohibit custody decisions solely on the basis of blindness neither bill has been passed yet – but mr robert’s case shows how crucial such legislation is sadly to simply preserve one of blind parents’ basic human rights – the right to the care and custody of one’s own natural children almost a year has passed since mr roberts’ parental rights were stripped – he remains resolved to fully restoring his parental rights though he was once a primary caretaker of his children he now sees them for only  hours each week – even then his time is “supervised” by a sighted nanny who he has been ordered to employ mr roberts also remains physically blind but many argue that it is the judge who cannot see   about christopher g roberts
