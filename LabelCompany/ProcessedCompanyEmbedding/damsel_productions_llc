fast paced arcadeplatformer game framed in a dark disney aesthetic with a pumping synth soundtrack the player assumes the role of damsel a mysterious agent charged with the goal of saving the world from the growing vampire hordes players use damsels great agility and skills along with her uv shotgun to clear each mission and uncover a conspiracy that will lead them around the world the player will discover new locations and missions as they progress through the story as well as unlocking new abilities and upgrading current ones every mission has a number of side challenges to keep the player engaged many of which are against the clock – the player must make the hard choice of going for more points or risk losing it all by not beating the timer damsel is a modern day artistically stylised take on classic pc platformer games such as commander keen duke nukem and prince of persia set in arenas or pac man style levels set in locations across the world each arena has its own unique challenges to face and master with the intended focus of the gameplay split between exploratory movement and actionbased combat damsel is currently ¾ complete and damsel productions llc are seeking up to  to complete the project and release damsel initially on pc mac and linux current progress damsel is between  complete the game is feature and mechanic complete the second pass of story and mission progression has been completed music and art have been completed the final aspects to be completed are the sound design final script design polish localisation and testing please follow the link to the latest game trailer for damsel  damsel tralier intellectual property damsel is a new ip created by screwtape studios pty ltd and assigned to damsel productions a delaware  llc damsel was created as a character to fill a gap of female led games most female lead characters are either highly sexualised see bayonetta   or have had a traumatic experience perpetrated against them by men see s tomb raider even though these characters are pushing forward gender equality in games they can often alienate the male and female players market research the aaa video game market is currently seeing an influx of older popular games being either ported or remastered and distributed across most platforms recently released or about to be released rebooted games such as tomb raider unreal tournament doom legend of zelda bioshock  systemshock  crash bandicootp as well as nintendo announcing the release of their games on other platforms such as rereleases of old games on mobile phones this rebooting of franchises as well as a large amount of sequels that are churned out each year have left players looking for unique and fun new ips the iii indie video game market has had some amazing reach with this need for new ips with strong titles being released by small teams the indie market has also recently seen an insurgence of games that are inspired by old franchises often selling the game on the back of the team who may have worked on the original title some of the biggest downfalls for the success of a game indie or triple a are similar and each of the elements below will be focused on by damsel productions to provide the highest chance of success unrealistic marketing  over hype promising mechanics or gameplay features and then not releasing with the feature lack of communication with fans about the progress of the titles unpolishedbuggy late release competitor analysis with a unique art style small and fast paced arena levels that are entered multiple times from multiple locations we have created a game that has been designed to stand apart from competing indie platform games the swindle metacrtic  price  unique indie d platformer with an art style that stands out from other indie games and small arena style levels the game style size gameplay and team size all make the swindle a competitor of damsel mighty no  metacritic  price  a mega man inspired polished d sidescrolling platformer that has received a lot of negative feedback for it not being the original also the game that was kickstarted was over time and budget but it mostly did not live up to the hype created about the game the fast pace of mighty no  makes it a competitor of damsel yooka lalee metacritic tba price tba yooka lalee is an d action platformer the game was kickstarted and has been created by members of the original rachet and clank team the games polish style and the fact that the release windows are similar will make yooka lalee a competitor of damsel video game gender research a  survey of  us students aged  to  by rosalind wiseman and ashly burch indicated that  of girls but only  of boys preferred to play a character of their own gender and  of girls as opposed to  of boys said that they were more likely to play a game based on the characters gender the authors interpreted this as meaning that the gaming industrys focus on male protagonists stifled sales to girls more than it promoted sales to boys hall charlie  march  the games industry is wrong about kids gaming and gender polygon retrieved  march how does the damsel ip fit into the current market due to the gender and gaming research it is obvious that young men and young women would like to play as female characters we believe that damsel will fit nicely into the market the character is also not a direct flip of the damsel in distress trope damsel is not out to kill or save men all enemies and hostages are of both sexes most platformers that are currently on the market or about to be released are sidescrolling metroidvania style games where the player is kept moving forward in the level however the arena levels of damsel let the player traverse the level and complete the mission in any way they want inspired by s pc platforms such and commander keen and duke nukem and by the arena levels of pac man this style of gameplay will stand out in the see of sidescrolling revenue  distribution revenue strategy initial release on pc mac and linux through digital distribution platforms primary platform steam damsel has passed the steam greenlight process and is eligible for release on steam secondary platforms direct  drive humble bundle gogcom pricing damsel will be a premium indie title being released at a  price point this price point will fluctuate as damsel productions realizes the steam sales a secondary release is tentatively planned on xboxone ps and nintendo wiiunx but currently is not dated for release price point for console release will be talked about with console holders before future release target audience target audience – girls and boys  to late s  t for teen primary target – action arcade and platform game fans fans of female superheroes secondary target – gaming parents looking for a female protagonist appropriate for their childrentertiary targets – mac and linux users looking for a fun actionpacked fully functional game in conclusion our aim for damsel has been to create a fun polished high quality indie game to complete damsel a sound designer and writer need to be engaged game text needs localization and a pr company will be hired to avoid any of the pitfalls of marketing and to make sure the great game we are creating is shown to the world damsel productions llc has newly commenced business and therefore

factors risks related to the companys business the company has no operating history and faces many of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies the company is a newly formed company and to date its business development efforts have been focused on the development and marketing of a single computer game since its inception the company has not generated revenues the company has not built a customer base and has little or no brand name recognition in addition the company faces many of the risks and difficulties inherent in gaining market share as a new company including but not limited to developing and commercializing its computer game developing and implementing an effective business plan meet gamer expectations attain gamer loyalty and continuously develop and upgrading its product offerings the company’s future will depend on its ability to finish and release its computer game or if the company is not able to overcome any of the foregoing risks and difficulties the company may not be able to generate revenues the company’s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate the company’s future business prospects and to make decisions based on its historical performancethe company’s limited operating history makes it difficult for investors to evaluate the company’s future business prospects and to make investment decisions on the basis of historical operations further it is difficult if not impossible to forecast the company’s potential future results based upon its historical data the market for computer games is unpredictable and subject to uncontrollable market and consumer conditionsthe market for computer games is unpredictable and accordingly games that are popular one moment may not be so the next the company’s computer game may initially be popular however changing market and consumer conditions could result in the game no longer being popular which would adversely effect sales and the company’s ability to generate revenues the company is relying upon a single computer game for its success if the game is unsuccessful or the company fails to develop and commercialize the product the company will not be able to generate any revenuethe company is relying upon a single computer game for its success if the company is not able to complete the game or if the company is not able to commercialize the game or successfully market the game to players the company will not be able to generate revenues sufficient to meet its costs and may have to cease operations the computer gaming industry is subject to rapid technology changes and improvements and if the company fails to anticipate and adopt new and improved technologies the company’s ability to compete will sufferthe rapid introduction of new and improved technologies in the computer gaming industry requires the company to be able to anticipate and adopt new and improved technologies that its computer game must take advantage of in order to make it competitive in the market when it is released the company may not be able to anticipate or adopt its product to new and improved technologies which could result in the company’s product being technologically inferior to competitive products or less appealing to consumers or both which would negatively impact the companys ability to generate revenues if the company’s game fails to gain market acceptance the company may not have sufficient capital to pay its expenses and to continue to operatethe company’s success depends on generating revenues from the sale of its computer game as a result if the company’s game does not achieve and sustain market acceptance sufficient to generate revenues to cover its costs the company may have to cease operations there is a significant and ever growing number of computer games available to the public and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate market interest in its computer gamecomputer gamers have a significant and ever growing number of computer games available to them at any given time all of these other games will be competing with the company’s game for gamers’ time and interest given the large array of games available there can be no assurance that the company will generate sufficient interest in its computer game to attract gamers if the company is not able to generate interest in its computer game its ability to generate revenues will be materially adversely effected if the company’s game is successful the company must effectively manage the growth of its operations or its business will sufferif the company’s game is successful the company’s ability to successfully implement its business plan requires an effective planning and management process in order to implement the company’s business plan the company must either generate revenue from its current product and future products or seek additional funding from outside sources neither of which can be assured further in order to grow the company’s operations the company will need to hire additional employees and to make investments in its business if the company is able to grow it will place a significant strain on the companys existing management and resources and will require the company to institute financial and managerial controls any failure to manage any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively would cause the company’s business to suffer even if the company does experience growth there can be no assurance that the company will grow profitablythe company’s success is dependent upon the successful launch and subsequent market acceptance of its computer game the company cannot give any assurance that it will be able to successfully launch the computer game or gain market acceptance of the game the company’s business strategy is dependent on expanding its product offerings and increasing its proposed revenues the company’s plans to pursue revenue are at an early stage and the company cannot assure you that its plans will be successful or that it will start or successfully proceed with them as described if the company cannot protect its intellectual property rights or technology effectively it could have a material adverse effect on its ability to competecreating and marketing a unique computer game is critical to the company’s success and ability to compete and therefore the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights and technology is critical to its success competitors might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use the company’s intellectual property without its permission and without its knowledge thereby infringing the company’s rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate its product if the company fails to protect its intellectual property rights adequately its ability to compete will be materially adversely effected if the company infringes on the intellectual property rights of others the company may be required to redesign its computer game enter into license agreements or cease marketing the game which would have a material adverse effect on the company’s ability to generate revenuesthe company’s success also depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties third parties may challenge that the company’s computer game infringes on such third parties’ intellectual property rights if challenged litigation may be necessary to enforce the company’s intellectual property rights to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement this type of litigation with or without merit could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and could result in adverse decisions against the company in the event of an adverse decision the company could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which would have the effect of reducing revenues generated by the computer game such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition any such litigation could result in the company having to redesign or cease marketing the computer game any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s ability to generate revenues the company has limited sales and marketing capabilities if the company fails to effectively sell and market its computer game it may not be able to generate any revenuesthe company

question about how you all arrived at the projected number of units sold each month andrew harris march   at  pm in regards to your business plans and offerings does your studio have market research in place to ensure that you do not cross contaminate between ips of similar type games being developed by other developers has general counsel been consulted for this matter christian enwere april   at  am as of now i see that its only available on windowsany plans for mac os computers or ps platform as an indie type game megan summers developer may   at  pm hi andrew i completely understand wanting to be sure you are investing in people and a product that has thought through all of the legalities we will be releasing damsel as a complete game like you buggy games on release drive me crazy i started in the games industry as a tester  years ago so we will have a very strict release testing schedule patches should only be needed for small edge cases thanks so much for your support megan summers developer may   at  pm hi christian if you take a look at the target platforms youll see were releasing on windows mac os and linux we believe this to be the best starting point for damsels launch thanks megan summers may   at  am hello investor my name is megan and im the producer and a developer of damsel i know there have been some replies from me in the past but very sporadically equity arcade has been posting my replies to questions as the platform has been developed but im happy to say that this is reply is in real time and we are here to answer your questions there is a missing reply that makes the thread look a little weird here are the missing responses and questions andrew in regards to your business plans and offerings does your studio have market research in place to ensure that you do not cross contaminate between ips of similar type games being developed by other developers has general counsel been consulted on this matter screwtape studios  megan in regards to ip contamination nearly all assets from art to underlying gameplay systems have been and will continue to be developed inhouse we also ensure that we strictly adhere to the licenses of any rd party assets we use in the game any aesthetic similarity to other products including visual audio and mechanical is entirely coincidental if we deem it necessary we will conduct a full chain of title evaluation before any commercial release as this is a standard practice we have not engaged counsel for this specific matter a major part of damsel seeking funding is to continue the original production of assets by hiring a sound designer rather than using sound purchasing sites even though this is again a common practice andrew has screwtape developed an action plan for testing prior to launch as a gamer myself i would like a fully polished product released and ready versus patches upon patches for the games i understand that is part of a development process its just the constant patches  in a few years that turns me off screwtape studios  megan i completely understand wanting to be sure you are investing in people and a product that has thought through all of the legalities we will be releasing damsel as a full complete game like you buggy games on release drive me crazy i started in the games industry as a tester  years ago so we will have a very strict release testing schedule patches should only be needed for small edge cases 😁 megan summers may   at  am hello again anyone who hasnt played the demo build for a few weeks or more download the demo
