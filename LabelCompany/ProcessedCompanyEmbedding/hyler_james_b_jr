carolina     born in danville virginia     boardcommunity involvement director at progress energy trustee of rex healthcare and past chairman of the greater raleigh chamber of commerce the north carolina chamber and the raleighdurham airport authority     career highlights served eight years on the usgas executive committee spent  years at first citizens bank retiring as vice chairman and coo     most recent read decision points by george w bush         the usga president is intent on raising environmental awarenesstake time to understand the company and the people sometimes the best way to go fast is to go slow if you can do that your chances of success are much greater while jim hyler is nearing the end of his term as president of the united states golf association usga he remains passionate about the game and about bringing sustainability practices to the course many people envision mornings on the golf course as a key aspect of retirement usga president jim hyler who “retired” from corporate life in  thinks about golf all day long but in a far different way the usga founded more than a century ago is dedicated to maintaining its leadership role regarding rules equipment standards its handicapping and courserating system and of course its championships but hyler is using his position to address environmental issues as well in his inaugural address in february hyler called on the golf community to recognize “how brown can become the new green” he reminded his audience that water is one of the most significant issues facing the future of golf with the southwest facing unprecedented drought conditions and the impact of a lingering economic slowdown the usga has been promoting a focus on “playability” rather than lush conditions there are multiple benefits improved turf health better drought resistance reduced costs lower environmental impact and a playing surface that is more fun to play understand yourself after graduating from virginia tech in  hyler joined ernst  young llp in winstonsalem north carolina he chose that office partly because one of his closest childhood friends rodger holley now a retired partner had joined it the year before also despite its relatively small size hyler thought the office had a “dynamite” client roster he served clients in a variety of industries but spent most of his time on the audit of wachovia bank he recalls his audit service to wachovia as an outstanding learning experience particularly when meeting with the bank’s audit committee “the committee was composed of a lot of very sharp people” hyler recalls “so we had to prepare well and be on our toes in that meeting room” he names retired partners dave bodenhamer and jim smith as major influences as a consequence of his experience serving wachovia hyler became a “goto” instructor of workshops on banking audit software according to hyler ey was at the cutting edge of the thennew area of audit software it was an exciting time so hyler was well prepared to assume the role of cfo at first citizens bank in  he stayed there for  years moving up the executive track to become vice chairman and coo in addition to learning the banking business hyler says that his experience at ey taught him how to interact effectively with people “as an auditor you are in a sense intrusive” he notes “how can you make the best of the situation and work with clients in a nonthreatening cooperative way” hyler advises recent college graduates that getting along with people is the most important quality for success in business he adds “if you can understand yourself you will find effective ways to connect with people” a double eagle one of hyler’s fondest memories goes back to his initial involvement with the usga in  he had volunteered to chair the president’s council a group of north carolina business leaders tasked with selling the us open at the pinehurst resort since the resort was located in a small community far from any major population centers many were skeptical ultimately the campaign and the event at pinehurst were “successful beyond our wildest dreams” he recalls subsequently the usga asked hyler to join its executive committee inside the ropes hyler appreciates the usga culture which maintains consistent priorities even though presidents change every two years the association is focused on continuous improvement with a particular emphasis “both inside and outside the ropes” of the us open as mentioned hyler and his colleagues speak frequently about policies that try to bring a better balance between golf and the environment he cautions “it’s my view that we overwater golf courses in this country … and that comes with a cost” today hyler spends about half his time on usga matters and is on the road more than  days a year “it’s a big commitment but an incredible experience i travel through the us and internationally meeting many wonderful people i’m very fortunate to have been able to do this” hyler notes that his wife natalie is incredibly supportive of his usga activities despite the fact that it’s meant postponing vacations for the last few years “she’s been great but frankly i think she’ll be glad when things get a bit more back to normal” he laughs all in the family golf holds a special place in the hyler family hyler’s son brad started playing at age seven and went on to join the golf teams at virginia tech and the university of north carolina “watching him develop from just a young kid into a good college player and then traveling with him all over the country to events that was a wonderful time” hyler reminisces hyler’s daughter lori played golf and soccer at the junior level she now has four children ages three through eight for those individuals choosing to leave professional service for the corporate world hyler is a stellar example he offers this advice “take time to understand the company and the people sometimes the best way to go fast is to go slow if you can do that your chances of success are much greater”  teeing up for the digital age while steeped in legend and tradition the usga is making significant investments in digital media and according to hyler to great effect during the  us open playoff round between tiger woods and rocco mediate at torrey pines usopencom served more than  million video streams including an alltime record of  concurrent streams during monday’s playoff the demand has prompted the creation of a new video internet console designed to allow more fans to watch future playoffs with “higher quality and more stability”  an “incredible experience” united states golf association president and ey alumnus jim hyler spends about  days a year on the road for the usga he is working to persuade clubs and golfers that when it comes to turf “brown is the new green” about the usga together with the ra the usga governs the game worldwide conducts three open championships each year — men’s senior men’s and women’s — and  amateur championships writes and interprets the rules of golf regulates and tests all golf equipment for conformance to the rules of golf maintains the usga handicap and courserating
