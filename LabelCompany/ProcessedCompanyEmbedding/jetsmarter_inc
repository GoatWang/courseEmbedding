marketing the uber of private jets  how jetsmarters cmo thinks about growing a unicorn jetsmarter a mobilemarketplace for private jet charter talks getting personal with its customers brand creation and strategies to stay competitive by jonathan lacoste jonathan is the cofounder  president of jebbit an enterprise software company that focuses on mobile marketing and consumer data lacostejonathan cofounder and president jebbitlacostejonathan write a comment credit getty images earlier this month i spoke with jetsmarters cmo ronn torossian about brand creation strategies to stay competitive in your industry and how jetsmarter gets personal with its customers if youre not familiar with jetsmarter its a mobilemarketplace for private jet charter frequently referred to as uber for private air travel heres my conversation with ronn thanks for taking the time ronn for those that arent familiar with jetsmarter could you describe what problem the company is solvingwere the fastest growing private jet company right now democratizing the private air industry jetsmarter is making private airfare available for more than just the typical  by either allowing customers to share a private plane or have a seat on the plane rather than pay a full fee for a new york to los angeles private flight you can just pay for the  seats you actually need we certainly try to make the travel industry that much less painful for consumers thats why weve seen so much growth were devoted to making travel fun again consumers are increasingly expecting more personalized experiences  how do you and the jetsmarter team think about incorporating this into your strategywhen i fly i eat a lot of pretzels and i love diet coke it makes such a difference to me when i get on board and they dont even ask me what i want they just give it to me because they already know i want it this personalization makes a huge difference we create profiles for our members allowing us to understand their likes and dislikes so we can better profile and understand them we can sit them next to someone who doesnt want to talk if theyre the type to put headphones in and relax during their flights if they love making small talk we can sit them next to someone else like that too at jetsmarter everyone has different experiences on the same flight because everything is tailored specifically to them we customize in such a personal way that whether its food or who youre sitting next to we want to make your journey the best it can be for you as a tech company everything and anything regarding how people interact with technology matters to us we are one of the most expensive apps on the app store our passengers want a luxury tailed experience we are excited about everything that tech has to offer  whether its servicing knowing how customers interact with our product or anything else our customer is successful wealthy and wants this unique product what advice would you pass along to other cmos of startups or growing ventureswell you have to move very quickly and you have to make decisions quickly you cannot be afraid to make mistakes because you will make mistakes were taking on companies who have been around much longer than us so we have to understand the importance of local market and adapting to markets  thats something to keep in mind whatever industry youre in but my best advice dont sleep too much we work hard to get where we are it all comes down to that whats been the best way marketing has helped jetsmarter grow into the unicorn it is todaydoing everything from big data to social keywords to events is the standard but the most effective method for us is our consumers word of mouth our ideal consumer is someone who we can reach through our core members a lot like a country club people get to socialize and get to know each other through the flights so whether theyre inviting friends having business meetings with colleagues or getting to know strangers theyre networking weve flown to the super bowl world series and so many more  we fly with all types of industries whether fortune  ceos professors or authors and we also do a lot of private events focused on entrepreneurs
