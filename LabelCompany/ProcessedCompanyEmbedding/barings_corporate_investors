ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a

does my ad appear your ads could appear on the top or to the right of bing yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough
