information for readers for authors for librarians home about login search current archives announcements home  volume  number    new volume  number   a geography of snow reading notes wh new  the tricksters documentary conventional readings of frederick philip groves over prairie trails  call it documentary describing it as a faithful account of seven journeys the author took over the course of the changing seasons between the manitoba town where he taught school and the house  miles distant where his wife lived the feel of documentary derives from at least two sources the specific details of number and location seven  manitoba and the verbal appeals to reliability faithful husband teaching school as with so many other of groves works however the text — of snow for example the fourth sketch in the series of seven — invites the reader at once to accept the narrative as fact and to see through the facade of detail to the inventive games the fantasy that the narrative plays snow tells of the teachers massive struggle with blizzard horses and obliterated land how heroic how manly how authoritative the reader is invited to respond robert kroetsch recognizes the game being played old liar he calls grovethenarratorofsnow in his poem fp grove the finding  — and rewriting groves story he gives the last word not to the narrator and his claims of a successful conquest of the elements but to the waiting wife her mundane enquiry you had a hard trip undercuts the illusions of epic tripping the trickster in this way kroetsch enjoys the tall tale that grove tells but he also reclaims the ordinary from the outlandish fantasies of the documentary pretender why is it then that conventional readings are so willing to accept the fidelity of the narrative record how does the text dress tall tale in the trappings of fact what does the success of the illusion have to do with vocabulary and more generally with the conventional language of land maybe grove has shaped his narrative whether deliberately or not according to conventional formulae and its the formulaic representation of empirical space and narrative time that draws the reader into accepting a sense of documentary transparency and maybe kroetsch for that matter is not altogether neutral in attributing the fantasy to grove and the ordinariness of reality to groves wife for kroetsch too uses his rhetoric to invite the readers judgemental agreement maybe the geography of presentation calls for a different a more layered kind of reading groves first book to be published in canada over prairie trails draws on conventions that had been well established by the time it appeared among these are the conventions of nature writing which was as subjective — as deceptively scientific — in cgd roberts for example as in grove the conventions used to represent a cold northland which was situated loosely in northern ontario les pays den haut of quebec and the western prairies as well as in the arctic as in the pretty pierre stories of gilbert parker the conventions of the journey as an epic test of masculinity as in the popular fictions of robert ballantyne and ralph connor a set of paradigms that richard phillips describes as a geography of adventure and the conventions of the documentary sketch itself which tended to accept the objectivity of narrative description as axiomatic in its entirety over prairie trails describes a kind of arc from the negotiations that set up the initial arrangements for travel to the last arrival home in the best of moods and conditions opt each of the seven travels reiterates this pattern in small reporting on movement over land across documentable place and using similar tropes to narrate the trip tropes of departure delay impediment surmounting impediment and arrival the repetition of which affirms the cumulative reliability of knowledge together however the sketches enact a kind of downwards and upwards parabola as well through metaphoric space and the sequence suggests that it is less the reliability than the arbitrariness of order that the repetition of tropes reveals the initial relatively uneventful journey that is immediately precedes one that hints at danger fog making the distance seem longer space troped by time then follows a sketch suggesting that danger is readily dealt with three sketches that refute this interim conclusion by intensifying danger representing it by means of blizzard squall and illness and a final sketch in which drift the slide in and out of alertness on and off the trail interrupts the ostensible security that experience preparedness knowledge and familiarity might have been expected to lay claim to snow itself appears in the central narrative position it is this position as well as the narrative stance it adopts and the acquired resonance of its title image that makes the artifice of this episode so instructive almost all the sketches refer to the fact of snow using winter to suggest emphatically the state of isolation or wilderness that gives rise to a language of loss deviation and adversity and that in consequence makes the language of accomplishment and resolution seem all the more orderly and reassuring closer reading of the text underscores the artifice reconfirms that the narrative arc enacts a condition of perception rather than records a set of empirical observations in a more than superficial sense the narrator tells his way through space and time at the beginning of the opening sketch for example he says to the reader that he will tell the plain truth and that it has been a stumble — not my sagacity opt  — that has led him to buy peter the horse who will save him so often on these pages but groves truth is never plain almost at once he is across a bridge between fields following a correction line and alongside a bluff the wary reader will listen for the intricate indeterminacies watch for the artful signs of deliberate misdirection hear evidence as metaphor language is the landscape being traversed and it is the telling not just the teller that cannot quite be believed  just the facts naturally snow begins with apparent precision the blizzard started on wednesday morning s optthe appeal to the calendar soon gives way to the subjectivity of memory and perception but initially this shift seems more like narrative coloration than deliberate rhetorical strategy it is of course both but by acknowledging how difficult this trip is known to be and how much more difficult — how nearly impossible — it will be in a blizzard the narrator asserts himself and inferentially establishes himself as knowledgeable rather than naive thus the subjectivity initially reconfirms the factuality of record when the plans and preparations are in place therefore and the trip subsequendy begins the textual appeals to geometry and science reconfirm what the reader expects to hear specifics of observation the ostensibly reliable evidence of categorical system and sensory measurement the record of the first mile of the trip for example is nothing if not cartesian this is a landscape of intersecting solids and planes represented as a diagram on a grid this mile is a wide well levelled road but  at intervals of maybe fifty to sixty yards steep and long promontories of snow had been flung across — some of them five to six feet high they started at the edge of the field to the left where a rank growth of shrubby weeds gave shelter for the snow to pile in their base alongside the fence was broad and they tapered across the road with a perfecdy flat top and with concave sides of a most delicate smooth and finished looking curve till at last they ran out into a sharp point mosdy beyond the road on the field to the right s  opt  knowledge permits survival in such a landscape and knowledge depends on observation accuracy an ability to read the signs so willing is the reader to hear the narrative as truth that the ambiguity of these assertions — the way their science blurs into semiotics with both these claims on representation being qualified maybe some and mostly as well as left right tapered and concave — for a time goes unnoticed i knew that kind of a drift the narrator asserts s  opt the detail sounds firm provided the rhetorical ambivalence is overlooked the emphasis falls instead on the narrators possession of learned — and useful— information i carefully lighted my lantern s  opt i had a clark footwarmer and made sure  it functioned properly s  opt i weighed dan the less reliable of his two horses he says with my eyes s  opt i knew the road s  opt i managed to hold them in line  i measured the distance with my eye  but then i knew that a northsouth road will drift in badly only under exceptional circumstances s  opt  this paradigm continues in a sequence declaring that sensory observation leads to knowledge that knowledge confers power and that i sees and knows reasoning as though conclusively that i therefore acquires authority this appeal to authority derives also from the way the language of measurement bleeds into the language of scientific description had i been a novice  the sight that met my eye might well have daunted me  from the fence on the north side of the road a smoothly curved expanse covered the whole of the road allowance and gently sloped down into the field at my left its north edge stood like a cliff the exact height of the fence four feet i should say in the centre it rose to probably six feet and then fell very gradually i believe i can say from my observations that if no new snow falls or drifts in and if no very considerable evaporation takes place a newly piled snowdrift undisturbed except by windpressure will finally settle down to about from one third to one half of its original height according to the pressure of the wind the surface of this drift  showed that curious appearance that we also find in the glaciated surfaces of granite rock and which in them geologists call exfoliation adfoliation would be a more nearly correct appellation of the process but from the analogy of the appearance i shall retain the more common word and call it exfoliation s  opt  science appeals here in two ways as the private language of an elite trained group the passage clearly reiterates the narrators claim to be a pedagogue and despite the concessions rendered by the words if about very and more nearly correct as the exact language that accurately describes the workings of nature if the terms are precise this rhetoric suggests then the actions that follow from them must be logically based in natural rules if natural moreover they must be real if real they must be true the narrative observations of landscape landform and weather in other words reconfirm the appeal to empirical truth all is consequendy in place ignoring the argumentative leaps in this implicit syllogism to accept the narratives overt claim on credibility  of course the reasonable man this claim is however as verbal as it is numerical consider a word such as apodeictically which shows up in the third paragraph of snow meaning appealing to incontrovertible evidence the word is the narrators although the sensibility to which it refers is ascribed in the text to the pale and holloweyed s opt school janitor who is the first to tell grovethenarrator that the blizzard will prevent him from undertaking his journey grove of course knows better it is the force of the of course that colours the passage and helps shape the readers sense of narrator for it functions in two ways snow begins with apparent precision wednesday morning then within three paragraphs gives way to a relative modification of an absolute it was that rather common truly western combination  that makes walking next to impossible develops by means of the indirect trope of litotes i cannot exactly say that i viewed it with unmingled joy assertively lays claim to a vague experiential authority  had been lost in a blizzard once or twice in my lifetime and as if it were the logical consequence of this experience of repeatedly going out in the snow and getting lost affirms his superiority to the cockney janitor i of course never encouraged him in his communicativeness s  opt emphasis added the of course suggests an absolute precision of logical paradigm a claim upon authority that invites an unquestioning acceptance of the narrators version of events coupled with the rhetoric of relative uncertainty and obvious qualification however phrases such as of course call attention here to the narrators ego by doing so they perhaps also relieve the ego of any claim on authority exclusivity and the power of absolute knowledge about nature land people station and hence suggest that the claim on the absolute contains within it the flaw that proves its own unreliability the narrators claims to be knowledgeable begin then to reveal the incredibility of his tale at the same time as they insist upon its scientific credibility in the narrative rhetoric of course does a verbal dance with as if the assertive meets the comparative in a kind of sustained stichomythia the narrator tells fanciful anecdotes then follows with logical paradigms the exchange building an incremental sequence that proves how easy it is for a seemingly rational evidencebased claim on truth to sound convincing this result draws on the willingness of a listenerreader to trust narrative to accept assertion in rhetorical practice for reality in life it derives also from the listenerreaders unquestioning acceptance of the authornarrators conventions of society nature and land one early claim to such authority reveals just how ambiguous an assertion can be and yet how functional in getting readerslisteners to infer the narrators special status and their own commensurate commonality the inhabitant of the middle latitudes of this continent has no data to picture to himself what a snowstorm in the north may be to him snow is something benign that comes softfootedly over night and on the most silent wings like an owl something that suggests the sleep of nature rather than its battles the further south you go the more of course snow loses of its aggressive character s  opt  precisely where this manitoba north is in relation to middle latitudes remains casually unspecified all that is necessary is for grove to use the word north and a whole set of conventional correlations follows on which snow subsequendy draws words such as barren wild inhospitable merciless s  opt hence for grove to know how to deal with the wild is to do more than simply claim a particular expertise drawing on the conventions of wilderness representation it is also to assert himself as a man of special power special stature and special capacities for civilized and civilizing behaviour the subsequent rhetoric — the tropes of logic tonally so matteroffact so unwild so incontrol— appears to reinforce this impression i knew that kind of a drift says the narrator it is treacherous s  opt as hypothesizes of course explains to the possibility as if of drifting opposition rational thought is an answer the snow kept coming down and piling up as it could not be any otherwise and as if to give notice of its intentions the drift had completely closed up my front door i fought my way to the school and thought s  opt the road moreover becomes associated with knowledge i knew the road as well as i had ever known a road s  opt  deviation from it calls for power this first wild plunge had taken us a matter of two hundred yards into the drift and managed to hold the horses in line s  opt this power for awhile sustains authority we turned to the north again and here for a while the road was very good indeed the underbrush to the left on those expanses of wild land had fettered as it were the feet of the wind s  opt  the imagination nevertheless threatens a renewed disorder the whole field was dotted with snow mounds as there were so many fresh graves s  opt  the logical mind grants the dangerous force of this opposition but refuses to yield to it of course it was not like going on a grade as for the road there was none left  and worst of all i knew positively that there would be no trail at any time during the winter i was well aware of the fact that after it once snowed up nobody ever crossed this waste s  opt  the act of writing circumscribes the dangerous disorder to which the emotional imagination can lead maybe  one day i shall write down a fuller account of my observations in this report i shall have to restrict myself to a few indications for this is not the record of the whims of the wind but merely the narrative of my drives s  opt logical assertion confirms but controls the magnitude of the danger here in the snow the craters were on a much larger scale of course s  opt  the danger can even be quantified into manageable format might have known it of course i knew enough about snow prob ably  a first provisional drift whose long axis lay nearly in a northsouth line had been piled up by the first northerly gale later a second larger drift had been superimposed upon it at an angle with its main axis running from the northwest to the southeast the fold marked the point where the first smaller drift still emerged from the second larger one this reasoning vas confirmed by a study of the clearing itself which i came to make two or three weeks after s  opt  emphasis added throughout whatever the landscape in other words the rhetoric places it under calm control the act of controlling moreover constitutes not only a psychosocial claim but also a structural paradigm which the narrative uses to appeal to both a sense of trust and a willingness to accept as natural a conventional design  coming to order for snow is in one set of its dimensions a transformation tale it tells of a man who presented with a journey treats it as a challenge undergoing the journey will take him through a test or series of tests which when he meets them manfully will win him his goal home hearth freedom virtue fair maid snow does present a few variants here its the horses that have their freedom  on reaching home   opt  and as robert kroetschs poem recognizes foremost among the variants is the real commonplace with which the narrators wife — the fair maid of the paradigm — greets him when he finally arrives my wife would not surmise what i had gone through s  opt  groves narrator remarks indeed she does not she does not surmise his trip into a conventional adventure because she does not apparently need to he might after all have travelled from the school in gladstone to the house in falmouth by the other way the other way it turns out he has deliberately accidentally unconsciously chosen the most difficult route in the snowstorm and having made a virtue of that when he finally arrives in falmouth he then proceeds to celebrate his foresight in planning to return to his school by the main cordwood trail to the towns in the south it was out of my way to be sure but i felt convinced that i could spare my horses and even save time by making the detour s  opt  the careful reader will appreciate the game being played here grovetheauthor makes it clear that grovethenarrator has all along been designing artifice the artifice has however so earnestly if selfservingly affirmed itself to be a matter of record — scientific factual logical reasonable — that the narrative asks the reader to accept even the ending as heroic and celebratory rather than antiheroic and parodic the form of the transformation tale together with its conventional tropes invites it nearing the end of his journey having just accomplished the most daunting and dangerous of his feats the narrator must cross a bridge in due time i came to the bridge which i had to cross in order to get up on the dam here i saw  one more structure built by architect wind the snow had very nearly bridged the deep master ditch  but below it was hollow — nothing supported the bridge — it was a mere arch with a vault underneath that looked temptingly sheltered and cosy to wearied eyes s  opt  structure mere master hollow vault the language invites a metatextual interpretation the text itself urges the action on grove authorbecomehisowntext by this point estranged into selfawareness now surrenders the lead to his horses they take him home and the narrative vocabulary spells out the tropes of transformation it seemed lifetime since i had started out he declares i seemed to be a different man is this still a documentary declaration or has the claim on uncompromised truth already been exposed as itself a rhetorical trope a convention that appears in every documentary form the west and the setting sun are certainly conventional signs of closure so is a turn towards the light and grove writes after his wife welcomes him finally taking her arm i looked at the westering sun and turnedtowards the house s  opri emphasis added because the narrative has been working with conventions of land as well as with conventions of structure and discourse this claim on house has also to be contextualized further for house not only refers to a documentary destination here it also encodes a set of assumptions about authority and the right to authority these in turn are rooted in conventional attitudes to space place gender and civilization for if house represents order in this paradigm with the man as ruler the distance the duration between house and school space and time coalescing epitomizes that which is notorder that which is unordered illogical wild in other words chaos the task which the narratorturnedquestor undertakes in consequence is nothing short of taming the wilderness of proving himself the master of nature thus claiming through strength experience and the superiority of his knowledge the godlike role of reestablishing order from chaos from early on this ambition is apparent as soon as the storm had set in the narrator claims i had instinctively started to work in order to frustrate its designs s  opt yet such a statement is resonant with paradox the ostensibly rational man claiming instinct as his guide and attributing design to the ostensibly chaotic forces of nature far from seeing that he contradicts himself the narrator uses such paradoxes to reinforce his claim on his own superiority of being insofar as readers can see the disparities it is possible to surmise that grovetheauthor was consciously drawing attention to the artifice of the text what is less clear and more doubtful is whether he might have been using this play to question the social assumptions on which the narrator relies it is also possible therefore to extend any analysis of contradiction to an examination of the tropes that serve the conventional distinction between civilized society and chaotic nature these include tropes of gender politics size and opposition — all of them related to tropes involving the natural now meaning uncivilized forces of intrusion and interference  he she and it snow addresses questions involving sexuality not only overtly — that is in the narratorhusbands declarations of his desire to be with his wife — but also allusively in the gendering of both the narrators journey and the landscape through and over which he travels grovetheauthor perhaps did not intend this selfdeclared record of his drives to be read for its sexual implications nor many of the narrators words to be read as innuendo but the journey is a psychological trope here as well as a formal convention it functions as a test or proof of the narrators manliness in addition to being the medium through which he becomes transformed the landscape and the weather moreover provide him with the agents of opposition against which he must measure himself and gauge his capacity for endurance repeatedly grove personifies or otherwise animates natures manifestations the winter sun for example is represented as male its subhorizon dawn referred to as a strictly localised angry glow male and emotionally aroused it turns almost at once into a rival an enemy in a very few minutes he would be up and i counted on making that first mile just before he appeared s  opt when the rabbitlike winddriven snow then behaves as if it meant to have a look at me s  opt  it seems not only that the narrator construes himself as the centre of the universe but also that he attributes to all aspects of natural action the sense of rivalry that seems to arouse him the maleness of his competitive desire for power seems undeniable his references to measuring distance for example or to the staying power s  opt and rhythmic plunging s  opt  of his horses peter and dan or to the shapes that the wind has carved shapes that resemble formidable animals a tropical gorilla a boa constrictor that has reared and raised its head  ready to strike at its prey   opt  or to the promontories s  opt  and the long lines of tall poplars and telephone posts s  opt quite directly he specifies his enjoyment of the clear sparkle and glitter of the virgin snow s  opt  and he recognizes the clearing caused by a bush fire which a few years ago had penetrated thus far into this otherwise virgin corner of the forest s  opt  the landscape is openly gendered and the sexuality of the narrators engagement with it is apparent rivalry itself however as much as a desire for conquest seems to motivate the action here — the formidable gorilla of the snowshapes for instance explicitly stands on its four hands and raises every hair on its back and snarls in order to frighten that which it is afraid of itself s  opt fear of what in the narrators case uncertainty lack of adequate knowledge failure absolute or comparative or perhaps an egocentred sad dissatisfaction with success the record of the storm by the end of the journey is written in fallen tree trunks  not in drifts of snow s  optlol the fact of gendering is itself conventional rather than innovative so is the political use to which the gendering of landscape is put for in snow as elsewhere construing the traveller as male and the landscape as female to be penetrated asserts a conventional masculine claim on power there was not a wrinkle in this inverted bowl there it lay smooth and slick — curled up in security as it were some twenty thirty feet across this had been a stretch covered with brush and bush willow and poplar thickets but my eye saw nothing except a mammiferous waste cruelly white glittering in the headess chuckling sun and scoffing at me the intruder i stood up again and peered out to the east it seemed as if these buttes of snow were a trifle lower but maybe the ground underneath also sloped down i wished i had travelled here more often by daytime so i might know as it was there was nothing to it i had to tackle the task and we plunged in i had learned something from my first experience in the drift one mile north of town and i kept my horses well under control still it was a wild enough dash peter lost his footing two or three times and worked himself into a mild panic but dan — i could not help admiring the way in which  he would slowly and deliberately rear on his hindfeet and take his bound for fully five minutes i never saw anything of the horses except their heads s  opt  nearing the climax of his story moreover it took a supreme effort on my part to make the horses obey  the narrator writes by a rhetorical sleightofhand the claim on power turns into a claim on imperial authority— that is on the right to claim the right to rule and the validity of the civilization that reconfirms this hierarchical precedence of powerful man over wild nature the narrative paradigm here — in which man tames the wilderness — can thus be read both for its gender politics and for its commentary on social politics in travelling that is the male narrator claims to be proving his masculinity by demonstrating his power over a female wilderness or perhaps also to be proving his masculinity by subduing the wilderness elements still construed as female within his own nature more indirectly the narrative is also using this gendered paradigm to assert the authority of an imperial european version of civilization over the wilderness that the narrator identifies with canada grove introduces this motif early when the school janitor he of the apodeictic utterance is characterized as an exceedingly badhumoured cockney who was dissatisfied with all things canadian s  opt  while this comment appears initially to set him apart from the narrator it soon transpires that at least to some degree they share its presuppositions the narrator spends the evening before he sets out on his journey that is with a charming lady and her husband who with a young anglican curate constitute the only circle of real friends i had in town he dresses for the occasion and after supper with his host and radiantly amiable hostess — in the sheltered homelike and protected house on a side street in this town — they settle back to talk old country the channel islands the french coast kent and london — those were from common knowledge our most frequently recurring topics s opt  the linked set of epithets here — dress charm marriage radiance friendship amiability englishness shelter protection reality — affirms the norm of an ordered orderable world by which to gauge as chaotic the otherwise unimaginable extremities of unpredictability distance and storm specific aesthetic conventions construct these versions of order and chaos and of the oppositional tension between them for all its concern with scientific data and its record of the realities of manitoba then the rhetoric of snow appears less to question the equation between canada and chaos than to reconfirm the power of european order to master the ungardenlike and therefore sublime aweinspiring terrorproducing barren   opt wilderness what the narrative further asserts is the power of narration itself to master chaos the language of authority takes control of the subject that is explicates it endeavouring to demonstrate its european trained learned logical male superiority to canadian natural chaotic animal female wilderness partly through the conventions of literary form  so big so strong so magical for the mastery that is represented by language form and social convention to have any stature however — in the terms of appraisal that the narrator is using— the wilderness alternative to conventional order cannot be dismissed as negligible for that would make the ostensible mastery itself of little consequence the imagery emphasizing size and batde consequently magnifies the distance and the storm — and verbally constructs extreme conditions which is not to underestimate the empirical realities of prairie winters but rather to stress the role that the language plays in this particular response to them in order to elevate even more the narrators own sagacity strength and power to retrieve rank system and discipline from the threat of disarray the concern for size for extremes is clear from the beginning when the rather common truly western blizzard makes walking next to impossible and might make travel quite impossible — especially for a man who initially says he has been feeling rather bad the week before s  opt  and who therefore sets himself up as an ordinary man facing unequal odds his quick series of assertions of what he knows soon puts the lie to the mock humility but the continuing characterization of the enormity of land and extremity of weather stresses not size alone but size as a sign of a kind of wilderness lawlessness an abandonment of the usual conventions twice the storm is referred to as an orgy an indulgence of titan wind s opt in which nature is engaged s  opt  reiterating the sexuality of wilderness it is the unfettered the unsafe and the unconstrained for which the narrator has to prove himself a match even before the blizzard begins scaling a sixfoot snowdrift and breaking in makes the task of walking tiring in the extreme s  opt when he does set out for the weekend ride he knows that a supreme test s  opt calling for supreme effort s  opt  lies ahead superlatives take over his vocabulary and his cast of mind awestruck he soon feels that he had challenged a force in nature which might defy all tireless effort and the most fearless heart s  opt but determines to meet it headon man not only meets animal nature here but does so by facing the biggest the worst the most dangerous the wilderness kingdom can thrust in his way snow like a boa a gorilla s  opt  snow holes on a much larger scale s  opt crests of snow like the wide back of a large fish s  opt a drift with a flank s  opt a last inhuman drift that calls for a last wild struggle s  opt  the narrator however claims to be equal to the task and superior to the opposition i began to enjoy the snow just as the hunter in india will enjoy the battle of wits when he is pitted against a yellowblack tiger i began to catch on to the ways of this snow i began as it were to study the mentality of my enemy though i never kill i am after all something of a sportsman s  opt the forces of opposition then are concurrently characterized as enemy and as gigantic combining the world of sportive military reality with that of folk myth and fairytale the combination reinforces yet again the way the text appeals at once to observed detail and unexamined conventions alluding to titan wind at one moment the text goes on to explain the difference between exfoliation and adfoliation the scientific terminology thus suggests the truth of the fairytale metaphor the wind had scooped out a funnelshaped crater which seemed to open into die very earth like a sinkhole the next pole stood like a giant buried up to his chest and looked singularly helpless and footbound the whole surface of this gigantic drift showed again that exfoliated appearance which i have described s  opt not unlike the maelstroms the quicksands and the gorillaridden jungles of popular romance the sinkhole here constructs the threat of danger the military metaphors extend it right in front a fortress of snow lay now a seemingly impregnable bulwark  with rounded top fitting descriptions which i had read of the underground bombproofs around belgian strongholds — those forts which were hammered to pieces by the germans in their first heartbreaking forward surge in  s  opt  the waves of the ocean rise up and reach out and batter against the rocks and batdements of the shore retreating again and ever returning to the assault s  opt and again the snow was thrown up into a bulwark  resembling a miniature gibraltar  bulwarks upon bulwarks all lowering to the south in these the aggressive nature of stormflung snow was most apparent they were formidable structures formidable and intimidating more through the suggestiveness of their shape than through their size s  opt  the narrator himself wears a military fur cap s  opt  barren land turns into battleground waste s  opt  a snowdrift like a gigantic barricade s  opt brings the military and the fairytale metaphors together and the next time exfoliation is mentioned s  opt  again appealing to credibility it introduces the climactic episode when natural danger is greatest and manly accomplishment proves greater still the danger as these passages make clear is that nature in these extiemes is preadamic s  opt savage s  opt uncivilized waiting on the narrator to return moral order to amoral chaos s  opt however temporarily and with whatever means of artifice lies at his command   and so unlikely for of course snow works most effectively when seen most clearly as artifice thats the point of kroetschs calling fp grove old liar  all along its been apparent if a listener were alert that snow is a tale an exaggeration — and the effect of kroetsch giving the wife the last word is that it undercuts all the narrators claims to the superhuman and the extraordinary and returns the voice of narration from the selfconsciously literary to the local vernacular groves own text itself makes use of this distinction as the several tree references indicate the language shifts from grove   opt and copse   opt to majestic bluff   opt with all that these words imply it remains possible however that grove was deliberately elaborate in his narrative play but fundamentally serious in his appeal by means of this play to the conventions of cartesian landscape adamic rule gendered authority european social order and the necessity of celebrating the representative manly hero whatever else ego does not seem playful in snow and the sketchs recurrent epic techniques — the extended in this instance scientific descriptions the catalogues of snowdrifts the specific homeric allusions — all suggest that the paradigm of selfasepichero appealed to grove for hero also read model the familiar parallels between the prairie and the sea furnish ready examples of the narrator as sailor odyssean prototype from the assumption of barren land it is a short step to homeric allusion the infertile waste around  two greek words formed on my lips homers pontos atrygetos — the barren sea s  opt  subsequently i understood why those homeric words had come to my lips this was indeed like nothing so much as being out on rough waters and in a troubled sea with nothing to brace the storm with but a windtossed nutshell of a oneman sailing craft i knew that experience for having outridden many a gale in the mouth of the mighty st lawrence river s  opt  the text pushes the reader to accept the homeric passages as report rather than as whim but it sidesteps one other option that of deliberately exaggerating or lying even while it declares openly that the passages are narrative the section of the text that concludes with the narrators statement this  is  merely the narrative of my drives begins with a broad metatextual hint the surface of the sea is a wonderful book to be read s  opt this narrated wintry prairie is selfdeclaratively a sea of words artifice comes into the foreground earlier the narrator admits he has become aware that the hosder had not been fibbing after all s  opt  when talking about the difficulties of winter travel but he never quite specifies that the opposite might also be the case that the truthteller might be lying yet at that english dinner party that precedes the whole arduous journey talk of the cold country has clearly turned from reminiscence to invention it was not very long before the conversation got around — reverted so it seemed — to stories of storms of being lost of nearly freezing the boys were sitting with wide and eager eyes afraid they might be sent to bed before the feast of yarns was over i told one or two of my most thrilling escapes the host contributed a few more and even the hostess had had an experience driving on top of a railroad track for several miles i believe with a train snowbound behind her s  opt  that word even still insists on a gendered hierarchy whatever the double force of i believe to declare belief to sow the seeds of doubt it is the men here who claim themselves most earnesdy to be adventurers who out of whatever desires and dissatisfactions project the archetype of the adventurer as a manly version of self and it is boys who most readily most willingly believe them to return to the climax of this narrative then is to see how it records not scientific documentary but the capping moment of an anecdotally embroidered adventure the narrator is driving his team along the snow that has piled higher than the treetops i did not realize at first that we were high i shall never forget the weird kind of astonishment when the fact came home to me that what snapped and crackled in the snow under the horses hoofs were the tops of trees nor shall the feeling of estrangement as it were — as if i were not myself ever fade from my memory — a feeling of having been carried beyond my depth where i could not swim — which came over me when  i took in the fact  that i was above that forest world which had so often engulfed me s  opt  escaping the forest and riding the sky anecdote after anecdote snow despite all its claims upon documentary — indeed even in its claims to be true — is a baron munchausen tale retold it conjoins the apparent accuracy of photograph with the murkier maze of crafted forgetfulness s  opt  and after the most outlandish or at least offlandish of its claims it trips swiftly to its conventional conclusion  hiding the husband  picture windows  one further comment derives from an apparendy casual observation that groves narrator makes early on while he is still testing the strength of the storm in the same paragraph in which titan wind is indulging in an orgy on our western prairies s  opt  before he leaves the schoolhouse he went upstairs to the third story and looked through a window which faced north but though i was now above the drifting layer he says i could not see very far s  opt  given groves penchant for portentous puns bluff for one see stich new world and perhaps trip it is tempting to overread the word story and find in not being able to see far an implication that much in the narrative is masked be that as it may the trope of lookingthroughawindow is itself a conventional sign of being distanced from real life cut off from participation in events positioned as onlooker — or perhaps — as narrator of makebelieve two stories by ethel wilson provide analogous examples which suggest how this trope might be further read in grove the window and a drink with adolphus from mrs golightly and other stories  both deal with single men of late middle age whose houses have picture windows glass glimpses of landscapeaspicture — in other words of others conceived contained framed as picturesque in the case of mr willy in the window the picture window after having been a conventional backdrop for an even more conventional cocktail party almost turns into a means of access for a burglar but at a critical moment mr willy looks up and because of a trick of light sees his own reflected image projected against that of the intruder the point of the story is that he reads the overlap recognizes that danger derives as much from himself as from outside himself and resolves to change his ways unlike the window a drink with adolphus presents no such obvious revelation set at another cocktail party this one at a different hillside house in vancouver it records the enthusiasms of the owner a man with the politically charged name adolphus bond for his own view and over the course of the story it also records the reactions of those who accept his assessment and of those who do not even bother to look and especially the reactions of one mrs gormley who has her own ideas about scenery and who claims the right to an alternative on the way to the party that is she has asked her taxi driver to stop and ill have ten cents worth of view the view was certainly superb and worth more than ten cents  in ten cents worth of time she thought — and she was very happy islanded lost alone in this sight — theres nearly all the glory of the world and no despair and then she told the taximan to drive on  bonds house it transpires is nice and rather shabby though its insides are charming  but because it places the view behind glass the window oddly restricts less oddly the choice of when and where to stop and look enfranchises what wilson engages with here is the rhetoric of covertness and concealment who sees her stories ask who is prevented from seeing what do they see if they can see what do they nevertheless miss seeing and why these questions obliquely return this geography of reading notes to groves snow groves narrator early on cannot see very far nor can the reader the one because of a declared interference between observer and observed the other not because objects are inaccessible but because the language is deliberately arranged so as to misdirect the reader listeners attention the difference between these two perspectives emphasizes the semantic distinction between concealed and coverp while these words in casual speech both mean hidden etymological sources suggest slight differences in agency conceal l concelare hide together covert l cooperire cover more significantly concealed has come to mean disguised so as to be kept from the knowledge of others whereas cover has come to mean disguised so as to be secretive sly and deceitful applying this distinction to snow asks not merely how it alters the characterization of the narrator but also how it invites different kinds of engagement between reader and characterand between text and social supposition since douglas spettigues  biography of grove it has become a critical commonplace to recognize groves talent for dissimulation to see him as an imposter who took on a different history for himself but in the process of dissimulation imposters invite others to participate in their masking and the willingness of these others to participate will suggest the dimensions of the social personal desire that they find attractive — the alternative version of history or reality in which they want to share and that they find represented in other words — in the masquerade that the imposter offers to them biographicauy grove offered canadian critics a version of himself as european nobleman that granted him and also them through him a kind of stature they were all seeking sophistication was the watchword identified with europe and with a particular definition of class but what about the narrator of snow in some sense his allusions to kent london homer and science all reiterate this claim on metropolitan worldliness in rural manitoba even the baron munchausen parallel can be read in this context — producing a version of the narrator as a person who is amusingly simultaneously concealing and revealing the truth of events from this perspective snow is a comedy its effects deriving from the readerlisteners ability to hear the narrative as a thrilling escape an oxymoronic punning entertainment punctured by the narrators wifes closing greeting you had a hard trip but to read the narrative alternatively as a covert tale is to reassess the relation between mask and desire one further definition of covert becomes relevant here in legal terminology and once in common parlance the word is used as a description of a married woman meaning under the cover authorityprotection of a husband in turn the word husband aymooqcay means a man who owns his own house and land a landholder — hence the related noun husbandman tiller of the soil and the verb to husband to manage prudendy to cultivate the soil the mind etc from the beginning of snow the narrator makes clear that his declared intention in travelling through the blizzard is to assuage his wifes concern and the sketch closes not as in kroetschs poem with the wifes interrogative greeting but with the narrators troped assertion taking her arm i looked at the westering sun and turned towards the house from this vantage point taking the frame into account the reader can begin to see the degree to which snow turns less on a concealed desire to mask as an adventure than on a covert desire to assert entitlement entidement to managerial social status — and to imagined authority — attributes that are equated here with manliness and troped conventionally as trialbyadventure test of power proof of independence and claim of prerogative over woman and land in consequence it is possible to read snow not only as a thrilling escape but also an an indirect effort to heighten or enhance the narrators selfimage the unexamined acceptance of snow as simple documentary however suggests in addition that the rhetorical trope relating adventure and land ownership with masculinity and social status which has long continued to exert a normative appeal engages readers in the same set of social assumptions and desires that grove was obliquely expressing notes i wish to thank tamas dobozy for the bibliographic assistance he provided me while i was writing this essay and kevin mcneilly and michael greene for their comments on an earlier draft  the unsigned review in the canadian forum may  might well have established this paradigm it speaks of the books authentic description of inland canadian weather and describes the chapter on snow as a good illustration of the writer as naturalist pacey  saturday night in  averred that the books main concern is meteorological pacey  and the  reviewer for the dalhousie review found the style to be clear and concise and the events recorded with photographic fidelity pacey  in  margaret stobie subsequendy regrets that the firm prose of the beginning of over prairie trails wavers in the later episodes when affectation creeps in with elegant inversions  wj keith by con trast noted in  that groves seven represented journeys were shaped conglomerations is keiths word out of possibly seventytwo journeys that grove might actually have taken  keith that is emphasizes the constructedness of the whole book the artifice serving to elucidate the observers complex and shifting relation both with nature and with himself patrick lanes afterword to the  reprint of over prairie trails echoes both these read ings lane alludes to the stark severe realities of prairie wintets but also to groves archetypal rendering of the journey through snow his poetic recognition of the beauty in winter silence and his celebration of the human powet to overcome adversity in many ways this article relating land language size authority gendet sexuality desire and constraint is a kind of extended footnote to my  book land sliding which looks at four ways in which canadian writing encodes or tropes attitudes to distance space land and power as territoriality as property as region and as site that work in turn draws on numerous other writings in spatial theory and a fuller bibliography can be found diere i would nevertheless single out die following theorists as particularly relevant to die present argument about groves snow stephen daniels and denis cosgrove on landscape metaphor barbara maria stafford on empiricism and the ideology of design ann bermingham on economics and the picturesque and doreen massey and beatriz colomina on space gender and sexuality for ease of reference i use double pagination throughout wherever relevant the s numbers refer to the publication of snow in die brownbennettcooke anthology and die opt numbers to the  reprint of over prairie trails these conventions are aesthetic more than scientific drawing in turn on eighteendi century distinctions between the picturesque and the sublime as the word picture in the following quotation explicitly suggests kp stich narcissism focusses on the lexical signs of uncertainty in over prairie trails and its relation to freuds sense of the unheimlich or uncanny stich writes landscape ie matter body weather ie spirit soul and language ie consciousness memory symbolically mirror groves narcissistic struggle for perfection while die environment lets him amplify his freudian ego or jungian persona the implicit conflict between the english and german languages dramatizes his attempt to free himself from his past by concealing it like all failed repressions  this one results in anxiety and partly at least accounts for die proliferation of the adjective strange and its variants when grove says strange or uncanny especially in connection with home he also says heimlich and unheimlich these german words literal but obsolete meanings are homely ie homelike and unhomely their respective modern meanings of secret or concealed and uncanny overlap  stich goes on to argue that groves use of the word exfoliation is an invitation to the reader to leaf out or page apart his text  but that while the entire text can be read for its defensive autobiographical revelations of groves double identity this identity in turn leads grove by means of his analytic insight and editorial control to a way of at least temporarily facing his illusions and of ending his creative struggles on a positive note  critics have found other ways of reading rhese comparisons attacking the idea of intentional fallacy for example patricia morley finds the images in snow to be macabre ludicrous slighdy sinister in keeping with the fury of blizzard conditions  morleys main concern however is to demonstrate that groves scientific and conservationist interests are expressed through the sensibilities of a selfconscious poet  certainly grove himself thought of this writing as not only great prose but real poetry to boot and in a letter to his wife catherine observed that in his account of the seven drives on manitoba trails he was finding that he was starting to condense my whole feeling of the north into them  when i read
