the issues plaguing the retail industry as he sees the potential for  retailers to file for bankruptcy this year he speaks with bloombergs erik schatzker on bloomberg daybreak americas source bloomberg jason mudrick whose  billion mudrick capital management specializes in distressed investments says he’s betting that the struggle among retailers is here to stay“this is a forever trend” mudrick whose mudrick distressed opportunity fund gained  percent last year said in an interview on bloomberg television monday “when you think about how things are going to look  years from now or  years from now our parents will be dead our kids will be adults  you think more people are going to be shopping online or less this is the amazon effect and it’s here forever”mudrick is one of a growing number of hedge fund managers who are positioned to profit from a collapse in the sector which could spur a wave of defaults mudrick said he’s targeting securities backed by loans taken by beleaguered mall and shopping center operators who have seen bad news pile up for their anchor chains including macy’s inc and jc penney co he owns credit default swaps on those securities and said his firm also owned protection against neiman marcus group inc which has an active and liquid derivatives market while in the past retailers have cited a merchandising problem now “they’re all saying we need to shrink our footprint” he said “i would describe this as a paradigm shift”jc penney said in february it plans to shutter up to  stores and mudrick expects the retailer to close a hundred more locations macy’s decided last year to shut some  outlets while sears holdings corp said it will move to close about  locations these decisions will crush c and dlevel malls said

that are coming out of bankruptcy and may eventually go public he said he likes contura energy inc whose shares trade at about  overthecounter because they aren’t registered with the us securities and exchange commission a steep discount to publicly traded peers “we suspect contura will go public at some point this year because the board has to be aware of this discount” said mudrick the manager said the flow of cash into highyield assets by mutual funds is a big concern because they promise liquidity to clients that may “evaporate” in times of economic uncertainty he’s shorting the highyield index as a cheap hedge on his portfolio he said in a separate interview on bloomberg’s toplivemudrick said he’s positioning his hedge fund to take advantage of dislocations in the credit market that computerdriven trading firms are for the time being unable to trade“we’re fortunate in that computers can’t trade distressed credit and it’s very difficult to get exposure to the things we invest in through other avenues” he said “i believe our style of investing will have a place in allocators’ portfolios for the foreseeable future”— with assistance by rachel evans and matt scully before its

are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization
