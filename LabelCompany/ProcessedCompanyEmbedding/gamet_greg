store in denver — about  in renovations to put up there were extra permits and inspections involved and it all had to be done on a rushed schedule so that dank colorado could be among the nation’s first licensed recreational marijuana stores to open jan  but gamet said the ordeal was worth it because the wall keeps separate the two hemispheres of his shop’s world the recreational marijuana side and the medical marijuana side “the product is similar” gamet said “but other than that they’re two completely different businesses” given the costs and headaches though it’s little wonder that most shops aren’t following dank’s lead almost all of the medical marijuana businesses in colorado that have applied to open recreational shops chose to hang on to their medical sides as well only four out of the  stores that have either applied to open or are already licensed by the state for recreational sales made a full conversion according to state figures those stores that kept both recreational and medical marijuana sides faced a problem recreational pot shops can sell only to people  and over but medical marijuana dispensaries can serve younger customers if a store wants to keep selling to under medical marijuana patients state law requires it to build a wall between the two sides and give them separate entrances in denver businesses that do so are known as “colocated” stores and they make up the minority of shops that have applied with the city for recreational sales only  of the  stores that have applied in denver intend to build a wall according to the city the other  are what the city calls “coterminus” stores meaning they sell both medical and recreational marijuana in the same space and all customers — including medical marijuana patients — have to be at least  industry advocates say stores putting up walls are finding it difficult the construction costs as well as the added permits and inspections complicate what mike elliott the executive director of the marijuana industry group said is already a complicated process “it’s already challenging enough to open the business for recreational sales without doing that” he said what the walls buy for the stores is the ability to serve a tiny slice of colorado’s medical marijuana market less than  percent of colorado’s medical marijuana patients are under  according to state health department statistics the average age of the state’s roughly  medical marijuana patients is  but gamet said the wall keeps the culture of the different businesses separate too while the recreational side of dank colorado has seen heavy traffic and quick turnaround gamet said customers on the medical side generally prefer to take their time when making purchases and discuss the properties of different marijuana strains “it’s more of an intimate environment” he said “we built our business on medical marijuana so for us to be able to service our medical patients effectively they needed a separate entrance” john ingold

denver consulting group’s greg gamet    apr  randall huft cannabis consulting blog almost twenty years ago greg gamet now  drove to colorado from in iowa in his beatup cadillac to join a rock ’n roll band with justin jones with whom he now coowns denver consulting group while their love for music was strong the pair knew they needed to earn extra money cannabis was all the rage in colorado so in  they opened dank colorado a licensed medical dispensary and grow operation as the business continued to grow and earn a reputation as a customercentric store they added staff jay griffin became one of the company’s first employees and bryan sullivan came on as an investorpartner in  dan glenn joined the nowthriving business in  the dispensary became one of the first recreational stores in colorado “in the years we’ve been running a grow operation and dispensary we really learned the ropes perils and pitfalls” said gamet “so we started the denver consulting group to help entrepreneurs start and run a successful cannabis businesses” to date denver consulting group has assissted cannabis businesses in almost every state from application and license support to compliance and packaging budtender training and human resources issues denver consulting group has assembled a team of the industry’s top experts from all sectors to provide comprehensive atoz services so now here is some interesting q  a with denver consulting group’s greg gamet what states are you most bullish on when it comes to opening new dispensaries we are especially bullish on massachusetts and believe that once a few challenges can be overcome the state could become the second largest market in the nation behind california the state’s proximity to major population centers and the fact that new york’s program is too narrow means massachusetts could become a hub for legal cannabis for the entire eastern seaboard gamet’s law dispensary location is not as important as it is in other retail operations if you build a great business and do everything right dispensaries can sometimes be located in an outoftheway location if you build it correctly they will come dcg created the standard operating procedures
