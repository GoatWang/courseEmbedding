the possible loss of principal the fund invests in fixedincome securities which are subject to credit risks including the risk of nonpayment of scheduled interest or loan payments which could lower the fund’s value the fund can normally be expected to have less significant interest rate related fluctuations in its nav than investment companies investing primarily in fixed rate fixedincome securities other than money market funds because the floating or variable rate collateralized senior loans in which the fund invests float in response to changes in prevailing market interest rates because floating or variable interest rates on collateralized senior loans reset periodically however there can be some typically short term dislocation between prevailing market interest rates and the interest rates paid on the fund’s collateralized senior loans accordingly the fund’s nav may experience related fluctuations from time to time similarly a sudden and extreme increase in prevailing interest rates may cause a decline in the fund’s nav the fund may invest in foreign securities which are subject to certain risks not associated with domestic investing such as currency fluctuations and changes in political and economic conditions highyieldlowerrated securities involve greater credit and liquidity risks than investment grade securities the fund is nondiversified which may entail greater risks than is normally associated with more widely diversified funds leverage may result in greater volatility of nav and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder’s risk of loss derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on fund performance distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change
