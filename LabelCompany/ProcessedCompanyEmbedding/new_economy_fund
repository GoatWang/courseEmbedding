two new publicprivate partnerships have emerged driving the widespread reuse of recycled plastics towards the mainstream in an effort to make good on its goal to design  percent of its packaging to be recoverable or recyclable by  and to increase packaging recovery and recycling rates food and beverage giant pepsico has partnered with nonprofit the recycling partnership less than half of recyclables —  million out of  million tons annually — in us homes are properly disposed of through its work the recycling partnership is working with local communities to improve curbside recycling and has already divert  million pounds of material from landfill and generated savings of  metric tons of greenhouse gases partnering with pepsico will help the organization expand its reach to improve recycling on a local and national scale “leading companies understand that the packaging product and service they deliver must be in alignment with their missions and goals” said keefe harrison ceo of the recycling partnership “investing in recycling directly addresses climate change delivering measurable reductions in greenhouse gases and water use moreover those investments help communities thrive progress is built on commitment across the system and we are pleased to welcome pepsico as a partner” pepsico has already made significant efforts to cut packaging from its snack and beverage products and working with the recycling partnership is a next logical step in  it removed  million pounds of packaging and used  million pounds of recycled pet earlier this year the company partnered with danimer scientific to develop biodegradable film resins for thin film packaging and in may joined the ellen macarthur foundation’s new plastics economy pepsico is also a founding member of the closed loop fund which is investing  million to raise recycling in the us through improved curbside recycling and materials processing “to meet our ambitious new goals on packaging waste and recovery we need to find solutions that work at scale” said roberta barbieri vp of global water and environment solutions at pepsico “this starts with the design of our packaging and pepsico is investing to ensure the materials we use are recoverable or recyclable beyond design it is vital that we boost recycling rates in the united states which remain too low pepsico’s work with the recycling partnership will enable wellinformed collective investment in local recycling infrastructure and education and drive real environmental benefits in our communities” meanwhile the closed loop fund has pledged to invest  million in greenmantra technologies a company that produces highvalue polymer products from waste plastics the funds will be used to finance an expansion of the tech company’s manufacturing operations in brantford ontario the project will increase the plant’s annual capacity of  metric tons by an additional  metric tons per year thereby helping greenmantra meet growing demand while diverting even more waste plastic from landfill the company’s plant currently converts postconsumer and industrial waste plastics including hardtorecycle films and bags into highvalue waxes these polyethylene and polypropylene waves marketed under the ceranovustmbrand are used in various industrial applications including asphalt paving and roofing plastics processing adhesives and coatings we are pleased with closed loop funds investment in our technology and their belief in our proven business model said kousay said president and ceo of greenmantra we are taking plastic waste that is destined for the landfill and costeffectively transforming it into materials that add significant value to our customers products and processes this investment will enable us to continue our rapid growth and provides additional credibility for our efforts “greenmantra’s platform technology is an important innovation that builds a new regional market for postconsumer recycled mixed plastics” said margot kane cfo and chief investment officer for closed loop partners “greenmantra’s patented process enables the upcycling of plastic waste into higher value products and is directly aligned with our goal of funding replicable technologies that will help unlock additional investment in recycling” construction of the plant expansion is anticipated to begin later this year

httpwwwchroncomnewsarticlewhenthefederalbudgetfundsscientificphp when the federal budget funds scientific research its the economy that benefits christopher keane washington state university updated  pm wednesday july   the conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news analysis and commentary from academic experts christopher keane washington state university the conversation emergency you need more disposable diapers right away you hop into your car and trust your ride will be a safe one thanks to your phone’s gps and the microchips that run it you map out how to get to the store fast once there the barcode on the package lets you accurately check out your purchase and run each step in this process owes a debt to the universities researchers students and the federal funding support that got these products and technologies rolling in the first place latest houston news video story continues below  by some tallies almost twothirds of the technologies with the most farreaching impact over the last  years stemmed from federally funded rd at national laboratories and research universities the benefits from this investment have trickled down into countless aspects of our everyday lives even the internet that allows you to read this article online has its roots in federal dollars the us department of defense supported installation of the first node of a communications network called arpanet at ucla back in  as congress debates the upcoming budget its members might remember the economic impacts and improved quality of life that past congressional support of basic and applied research has created here in the state of washington federally funded research at both my employer washington state university and the university of washington has led to transformational innovations it’s helped spawn not only new products that save and improve lives but productivity growth through new businesses and services just a few examples include new kinds of compositebased lumber smart home technology for the aged kidney dialysis machines airport explosive detectors and new varieties of wheat potatoes and other agricultural crops that we enjoy at our tables and in numerous products all these inventions relied on federal investment combined with university research lab expertise the important final step was commercialization together it all led to positive economic impacts we see this pattern again and again for instance next time you’re on google remember it was founded by two stanford university doctoral students who were funded in part by national science foundation graduate fellowships fast forward  years and here in my backyard the company is busy building a new campus in downtown seattle that may house  workers by  many of those hired will likely be graduates from both wsu and uw the fact is that thousands of companies can trace their roots to federally funded university research and since the majority of federally funded research takes place at america’s research universities – often in concert with federal labs and private research partners – these spinoff companies are often located in their local communities all across the country just one of these firms headquartered in broomfield colorado employs over  workers and started with researchers at the university of colorado who create instruments data exploitation solutions and technologies for civil commercial aerospace and defense applications another in audubon pennsylvania develops rapid noninvasive “liquid biopsy” tests for cancer screening and early detection based on research from the university of pennsylvania and another company with  employees in madison develops highdensity dna microarrays for pharmaceutical research based on research from the university of wisconsin the list goes on and on focusing federal research funding on research universities who enjoy strong corporate and business partners has strategic value there is little doubt that the state of washington’s recent economic successes for example comes down to a cycle of innovation and discovery that feeds additional economic growth and privatepublicuniversity relationships federal rd funding is a key ingredient our two public research universities have strong relationships with federal funding agencies together washington state university and the university of washington – the largest recipient of federal research funding in the nation among public universities – form the technological and intellectual pillar around which many of our state’s successful businesses are built and sustained both universities graduate thousands of undergraduate and graduate students who provide a constant supply of educated trained workers in turn the universities and federal rd investment benefit from the active engagement and monetary support of business leaders and professionals innovative ideas and knowledge percolate back and forth between federally funded research and the private sector a recent milestone provides an example federal research dollars helped solidify a collaboration aimed at solving a big problem the high carbon emissions from air travel a contributor to climate change wsu worked together with the uw and a host of other regional public research institutions the us department of agriculture alaska airlines weyerhaeuser corp gevo inc and a large alliance of private industry to develop a renewable affordable source of jet fuel each collaborator brought unique expertise to the innovation table usda provided the funding and the policy commitment to the development of biofuels that spurred matching investment from private partners alaska airlines brought the need to reduce its carbon emissions and its leadership in applying clean technologies to improve its environmental performance wsu contributed decades of pertinent experience in both basic science and applied research uw researchers demonstrated the fuel’s potential reduction in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and gevo inc brought its privatesector skills and patented technology in developing biobased alternatives to petroleumbased products the sum of these parts created a strong successful partnership that took a big step toward sustainable aviation individual researchers with their deep expertise remain the bedrock of the research enterprise but teams of scientists – drawn from research universities government and the private sector – all working on multidisciplinary problems are having an increasing impact importantly this phenomenon is not unique to the state of washington the nation’s most active innovation hubs and successful regional economies have similar factors that drive economic growth and resiliency including  toptier research institutions supported by federal state and private funding  a concentration of talented and diverse workers  an ecosystem of firms entrepreneurs and intermediaries  accessible pools of risk capital  a global orientation and  communities that take advantage of the area’s unique assets and advantages in creating a desirable quality of life we see these conditions coming together around the country in silicon valley the raleighdurham research triangle park boston’s metro area and other innovation hubs in cities like boulder colorado madison wisconsin austin texas and gainesville florida it’s this cooperative model and leveraging of federal rd dollars that have long been this nation’s competitive advantage with fewer federal dollars allocated to scientific rd the next silicon valley – with its potential for an economic renaissance for a new area not even on our innovation map yet – may not emerge as quickly this article was

jul   by using this website you consent to our use of cookies for more information on cookies see our cookie policy x ecb proposes new reporting rules for pension funds details of every stock bond or other investment held by pension funds will have to be recorded about  hours ago dominic coyle the ecb is interested in how pension fund money is invested – in which countries for how long and in which sectors of the economy         the european central bank has proposed new reporting rules for pension funds details of every stock bond or other investment held by pension funds will have to be reported to the ecb under the proposed new regulation as the bank looks to harmonise information on pension fund assets and liabilities across the euro zone aurel schubert the bank’s director of general statistics said the new data would fill an important data gap he said pension funds were one of the largest and fastest growing investors in global capital markets assets up to  million citizens across the euro zone including in ireland will rely on private pension funds for retirement income and assets in such funds has almost doubled in the  years since the financial crash to around € trillion the ecb is interested in how that money is invested – in which countries for how long and in which sectors of the economy a public consultation period on the new draft rules opens on wednesday and will run until september th a public hearing will be held by teleconference on september st the ecb expects the new rules to come into force early next year they will oblige pension funds to report on their assets and financial transactions quarterly and on liabilities and scheme membership annually the first reports will be due at the end of  following consultation with the industry plans for quarterly reporting of scheme liabilities has been dropped the rules are likely to impose significant new costs on pension funds many of which will have to upgrade it systems and adjust current data sets “remarkably in most cases setup costs were estimated to be significantly higher than running costs” the ecb said reporting on industry feedback derogations from reporting will be granted to the smallest pension funds – particularly those with less that € million in assets or fewer than  members – the ecb says as long as a minimum of  per cent of the total pension fund assets in a member state are covered by reporting data aside from full derogations the ecb says reduced amount of data will be required from smaller institutions required to engage with the reporting ultimately it says “less than  per cent of the total potential reporting population – around  to  pension funds – will actually be subject to the full set of reporting obligations” even this small cohort will the bank says cover twothird of pension scheme members those subject to the full set of reporting obligations will be required to deliver  separate bits of data mr schubert noted that this compared favourably with the  data points required of the banking sector in its regular statistical reports the ecb says better pension fund statistics will “greatly assist monetary policy decision making and help keep the financial system sound and transparent” the new rules will not apply to social security pensions such as ireland social insurance fund which manages the state pension or individual pension plans       topics aurel schubert european central bank read more ptsb shares plunge as concerns over bad loans stall dividend analysis ptsb shares slump as bad loans haunt bank
