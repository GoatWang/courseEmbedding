fund of funds to invest in assets that might not be securities under the  act your letter requests assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under sections da and b of the  act against the fund of funds or an underlying fund if the fund of funds’ investment in the underlying funds meets all of the provisions of section dg of the  act and rule d under the  act except for rule da to the extent that it restricts the fund of funds from investing in assets that might not be securities under the  act ii  analysis section da of the  act in relevant part prohibits the

sections da and b for certain fund of funds arrangements within the same group of investment companies such as the fund of funds one of the conditions in section dg which was enacted in  limited a fund of funds’ other investments to government securities and shortterm paper in  the commission adopted rule d to permit a fund of funds relying on section dg to invest among other things in any types of securities that are consistent with its investment policies the commission noted that allowing such greater flexibility for a fund of funds to meet its investment objectives did not present any additional concerns that section dg was intended to address in  the commission proposed amendments to rule d to permit among other things a fund of funds relying on section dg to invest in assets such as real estate futures contracts and other financial instruments that might not qualify as securities under the  act the commission noted that it had issued exemptive orders providing such relief and that such greater flexibility did not appear to present any additional concerns that section dg was intended to address the larger rulemaking of which the proposed amendments to rule d were a part remains on the commission’s regulatory flexibility agenda as a potential rule reproposal the commission has continued to issue exemptive orders providing the relief that would have been codified in the rule d amendments the commission has conditioned such exemptive orders on compliance with all of the provisions of rule d except for paragraph a to the extent that it restricts a fund of funds from investing in assets that might not be securities under the  act    consistent with the rationale behind these exemptive orders and the commission’s proposed amendments to rule d you request

 more search options press release sec charges gatekeepers of two mutual fund trusts for inaccurate disclosures about decisions on behalf of shareholders for immediate release  washington dc may  — the securities and exchange commission today charged the gatekeepers of a pair of mutual fund trusts with causing untrue or misleading disclosures about the factors they considered when approving or renewing investment advisory contracts on behalf of shareholders some trusts are created as turnkey mutual fund operations that launch numerous funds to be managed by different unaffiliated advisers and overseen by a single board of trustees the federal securities laws require all mutual fund directors to evaluate and approve a funds contract with its investment adviser and the funds must report back to shareholders about the material factors considered by the directors in making these decisions the sec enforcement divisions asset management unit has been taking a widespread look into the investment advisory contract renewal process and fee arrangements in the fund industry an sec investigation that arose from an examination of the northern lights fund trust and the northern lights variable trust found that some of the trusts shareholder reports either misrepresented material information considered by the trustees or omitted material information about how they evaluated certain factors in reaching their decisions on behalf of the funds and their shareholders the trustees and the trusts chief compliance officer northern lights compliance services nlcs were responsible for causing violations of the secs compliance rule and the trusts fund administrator gemini fund services gfs caused violations of the investment company act recordkeeping and reporting provisions the firms and the trustees have agreed to settle the secs charges determining the terms of the investment advisory contract especially compensation of the adviser is one of the most critical duties of a mutual fund board said george s canellos codirector of the secs division of enforcement we will aggressively enforce investors rights to accurate and complete information about the boards process and decisionmaking the five trustees named in the sec enforcement action are michael miola of arizona lester m bryan of utah anthony j hertl of florida gary w lanzen of nevada and mark h taylor of ohio according to the secs order instituting settled administrative proceedings the northern lights trusts included up to  mutual fund series from january  to december  most of which were managed by different advisers and subadvisers the trustees conducted  board meetings during that time period and made decisions about  advisory and  subadvisory contracts during whats known as the c process section c of the investment company act requires fund directors to request and evaluate information that is reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of any contract for an investment adviser of a registered investment company the secs order found that some boilerplate disclosures related to the c process that were included by gfs in some fund series shareholder reports contained untrue or misleading information for example one disclosure claimed that the trustees had considered peer group information about the advisory fee however no such data had been provided to the trustees other disclosures misleadingly indicated that the funds advisory fee was not materially higher than its peer group range when in fact the fee was nearly double the peer groups mean fee or even higher gfs failed to ensure that certain shareholder reports contained the required disclosures about the trustees evaluation process and failed to ensure that certain series within the trusts maintained and preserved their c files the secs order also found that certain mutual fund series did not follow their policies and procedures for the trustees approval of the investment advisers compliance programs fund boards are required to approve the policies and procedures of service providers to a fund including its adviser the policies and procedures of each series within the northern lights trusts stated that the trustees could approve the compliance program of each series investment adviser based on their review of an advisers compliance manual or based on a summary provided by nlcs that familiarized them with the salient features of the compliance program and provided a good understanding of how the program addressed particularly significant compliance risks rather than following this process the trustees approval of the advisers compliance programs was based primarily on their review of a brief written statement prepared by nlcs saying that the advisers compliance manuals were sufficient and in use and a verbal representation by nlcs that such manuals were adequate these violations make clear that turnkey mutual fund arrangements can pose significant governance concerns and trustees must be vigilant in ensuring that the funds they oversee meet their disclosure compliance reporting and recordkeeping obligations said marshall s sprung deputy chief of the sec enforcement divisions asset management unit the secs order finds that gfs caused violations of sections e and a of the investment company act and rules e and aa nlcs and the trustees caused violations of rule aa under the investment company act and the trustees caused violations of section b of the investment company act without admitting or denying the secs findings gfs and nlcs each agreed to pay  penalties and the firms and trustees agreed to engage an independent compliance consultant to address the violations found in the secs order they agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of those provisions the secs investigation was conducted by asset management unit members in the denver and new york offices including james scoggins noel franklin john mulhern and catherine lifeso the examination that led to the investigation was conducted by bruce ketter craig ellis and phil perrone of the denver office  related materials sec order stay connected  twitter
