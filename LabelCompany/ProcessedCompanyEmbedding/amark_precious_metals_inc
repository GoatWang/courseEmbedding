classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase order and the price that rosland capital actually pays for the products purchased by customer under such purchase order is known as the spread and it is stated as a percentage of the purchase price

soxhub in the early months after the company went public amark’s internal audit team faced numerous challenges with their sarbanesoxley compliance efforts be it performing walkthroughs testing controls or documenting results they couldn’t settle on an efficient way to communicate to process owners and share statuses with the management “presoxhub our internal audit environment was mostly managing everything all the documentation control information in shared folders and the main pain point was the clutter of information and documentation it was really difficult to give a good picture of the status and also it made communication inside the company difficult” access to realtime information implementing soxhub transformed the way sox compliance was performed at amark the tool’s single control web page design was an instant hit among all the users moreover soxhub’s dashboard brought a lot of transparency and visibility to the compliance process providing stakeholders with a realtime snapshot of the current status “it gives you a onestop realtime glance of the status that’s the most important thing for an internal audit you don’t have to go to a different folder for test papers and supporting documents then a different folder for narratives and another folder for walkthroughs now you have everything at your fingertips” further soxhub made the process of generating reports effortless for amark users instead of filtering large data and then running pivot tables users could now generate custom reports at the click of a button by selecting the required columns all from a single page view managing the audit team is simpler soxhub provided amark with a single reliable platform to manage all activities related to sox compliance through the tool the director of internal audit could review and comment on the work performed by other team members while constantly tracking the status of their work “soxhub has made management of my audit team very easy because

precious metals there are countless private minting facilities and refineries in the united states and the number seems to be growing with each passing year capitalizing on the upward trend of precious metals in recent years refiners have either opened their doors in recent years or expanded their portfolio of silver and gold products amark precious metals has been a “leader in precious metals since ” and their brand awareness has only grown along with the increase in the popularity of silver gold platinum and palladium in the past decade silvercom is proud to carry a variety of amark products and these includes silver rounds and investment grade silver bars browse through the collection of amark silver products available online today at silvercom amark silver rounds one of the most prominent products offered by amark is its liberty bell silver rounds these  oz silver products are an excellent alternative to bullion coin programs and more costly minted ingot bars silvercom offers the chance to purchase the most popular product available from amark mint its signature  oz silver round the rounds in this listing are available to you in mintsealed tubes with each round verified in brilliant uncirculated condition rounds in bu condition have no signs of wear and tear but may have spotted surfaces contact marks from the striking process or breaks in the luster the obverse face of the  oz amark silver liberty bell round celebrates the liberty bell from its wooden yoke to its iconic crack that extends to its lip viewers are certain to appreciate the detailed rendering of this national treasure unfurling above the liberty bell is a scroll which reads “life liberty happiness” in reference to the inalienable rights outlined in the declaration of independence inscribed underneath the bell is the amark logo accompanied by the purity of the round on reverse side of the round features the image of a heraldic eagle this wellknown emblem depicts the national bird with its wings outstretched as it upholds a starspangled shield in its talons it grasps an olive branch along with a set of arrows further emphasizing the patriotic motif of this illustration is the arch formation of stars appearing behind the eagle as a final touch artists have engraved the round’s weight and purity along with the words “liberty silver” in a circular border around the eagle why choose silver rounds silver rounds are a popular means of investing and building a collector’s portfolio for many numismatists there are many reasons for the popularity of silver rounds viewed as a snapshot of the current economic climate silver rounds are surging in popularity for the exact same reason as bullion coins such as the american silver eagle canadian silver maple leaf and chinese silver panda silver prices while gold and platinum have shot to record highs at various points in recent years silver prices are shrinking lower silver prices push more investors into the marketplace these individuals look to invest their hardearned cash in silver now while prices are low allowing them to purchase greater quantities of silver and hold onto those with the longterm goal of seeing silver prices rise the greatest benefit that silver rounds have compared to popular bullion coins such as those mentioned above is the producer yes coins from the united states mint royal canadian mint and perth mint among others are in high demand and they are among the highest quality coins available today however there are two hurdles preventing average investors and new investors from getting into the market first many of the sovereign coins released by these mints are restricted in production on one level or another for example perth mint coins such as the australian silver kookaburra and australian silver koala have limited mintages usually maxed at  million that restrict the amount available on an annual basis in the case of the american silver eagle the united states mint strikes the coins to meet demand however the mint has been forced to institute an allocation program restricting the volume at times to meet the immense demand for silver coins more importantly the coins struck by these mints have higher premiums over the spot price of silver the demand for these coins and the limited mintage of each leads to higher prices making it difficult for collectors to regularly purchase the designs they covet and tougher for new investors to break into the market if you’ve been considering the purchase of silver rounds as part of your investment portfolio or collection browse the complete variety of jm bullion silver rounds below amark silver bars silver bars are a popular option for any investors offering the opportunity to invest in larger quantities of silver without procuring more products such as coins and consuming more space in the process additionally some silver bars are produced as cast products that offer some of the lowest premiums over the spot price of silver you’ll find on the market today among those options is the  oz amark silver bar this simple product from amark features only the mint’s own designs and is available at extremely affordable prices on the obverse side of the  oz amark silver bar you’ll find the largefont bold image of the amark logo this design features a stylized letter “a” with horizontal lines swooping off to its righthand side below it are engravings of the mint name the bar’s purity metal content and weight flip the bar over and you’ll find a repeating text pattern on the reverse this test is set at a degree angle across the bar reading from the lower left to the upper right of the bar’s reverse face the included text reads “” “pure silver” and “ oz troy amark” why choose silver bars there is no more popular product in the world right now than a silver bar investors and collectors alike are flocking to silver because despite its high prices it’s still an incredible investment vehicle that offers individuals protection against the volatility of the modern stock market humans have long looked to precious metals as a means of protecting individual wealth and mints around the globe have responded in recent years with an expanding portfolio of silver bars modern silver bars are more than just bland precious metal products with uninspiring designs while there is always a pure product available for the investor that is easy to store and transport there are also an increasing number of silver bars available that feature unique designs offering the perfect combination between  purity and the creativity often reserved only for gold and silver coins handpoured bars offer the simplest option and lowest prices for silver bars as the name suggests each of these bars started out as melted silver or gold in some cases that is poured by hand into a mold that reflects the basic design a mint or refinery is going for there are no computers involved in the production of handpoured bars and as a result you will often find minor imperfections in the overall finish of the product each product will have its own unique finish because of the manner in which it cools into a hardened form this of course is all part of the allure of handpoured products conversely minted ingots are highly refined in appearance and come with higher prices refiners start by manufacturing long flat cast bars to serve as the blanks upon which minted ingots will eventually be formed traditionally this was done by creating a long mold that was used in the production of cast bars these molds made it possible to create cast blanks with the precise width thickness and length required to make minted ingots to speed up the process modern refiners will often use a continuous casting process instead this produces bar stock of the required width and thickness on a continuous basis that is then fed into a continuous casting machine throughout a very complex process the cast blanks are melted under induction heating or resistance heating to form minted ingot shapes that match exact specifications the new bars are then broken down in a rolling mill to reduce the larger batches down to the required thickness and an interstage annealing process occurs that recrystallizes the grain structure of the metals and improves the surface finish of the bar the rolling mill combined with a strip annealing furnace help refine the bars to their required thickness further exposure to a gauging mill refines the bars even more before they are eventually sent to the blanking press where each individual bar is punched out of the strip to prepare for striking process at which point mint marks and designs are added to the finished product about amark precious metals amark is a fullservice

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase

classifications rosland capitals classification of a particular product as bullion numismatic seminumismatic or premium expresses rosland capitals opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same product differently the classification of a particular product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time rosland capitals spread and prices are based on rosland capitals classification determinations bullion may be in bar or coin form and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal which is its current market price numismatic coins including proof coins are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand scarcity dates condition and grades and less so on precious metal content seminumismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain as well as other factors such as supply and demand premium coins include numismatic and seminumismatic coins as well as proof coins and exclusive specialty coins of limited mintage whose value derives from their quality and limited supply as well as their precious metal content exclusive specialty coins are typically of high quality limited mintage high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source rosland capital determines which products are designated exclusive specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors precious metals that have lower precious metal content which may include some numismatics will have a lower “melt value” which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price for example if the spot price of gold is  per ounce a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of  spread the difference between the purchase price customer pays for products under a purchase
