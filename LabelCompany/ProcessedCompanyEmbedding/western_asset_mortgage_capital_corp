philosophy which developed from a singular focus in fixedincome asset management over a variety of credit cycles and market conditions is to provide clients with diversified tightly controlled longterm valueoriented portfolios through rigorous analysis of all sectors of the fixedincome market our manager seeks to identify assets with the greatest riskadjusted total value potential in making investment decisions on our behalf our manager incorporates its views on the economic environment and the outlook for the mortgage markets we expect to benefit from the breadth and depth of our manager’s overall investment philosophy which focuses on a macroeconomic analysis as well as an indepth analysis of individual assets and their relative value we rely on our managers expertise in asset allocation and identifying attractive assets within our investment strategy although our core investment strategy is focused on agency rmbs agency cmbs and residential and commercial whole loans  our manager’s expertise in related investment disciplines such as nonagency rmbs nonagency cmbs abs and gse risk sharing securities provides our manager with both  valuable investment insights to our agency securities investment selection and strategy and  flexibility to invest in assets other than agency rmbs and cmbs opportunistically as market conditions warrant teambased investment approach our investment process is based on a collaborative team approach utilizing a combination of bottomup research and topdown macroeconomic analysis this approach begins with the development of a global investment outlook that includes forecasting economic growth interest rates inflation and credit spreads strategies are then driven by the difference between our interpretation of market fundamentals and what has been generally priced into securities in the market using a disciplined investment approach our manager sets targets for asset allocation duration and credit quality for each sector of the fixedincome market this view is then carefully laid against expectations already priced into the markets in order to arrive at an investment strategy and portfolio structure   western asset
