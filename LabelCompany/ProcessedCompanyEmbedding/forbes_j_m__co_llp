forbes  cojohn murray forbes was born in bordeaux france in  where his father ralph was making another of many unsuccessful attempts to establish himself in foreign trade the family moved back to milton massachusetts in  and older brothers thomas and robert bennett forbes soon went to work for their maternal uncles james and thomas handasyd perkins at age twelve and were soon sent to sea ultimately moving to work in the china trade at canton now guangzhou upriver from hong kong and macaoafter several years at the progressive round hill school in northampton the much younger john joined the perkins firm at  and shipped out to china three years later arriving in china to learn of his elder brother thomas’ death in a typhoon john soon was pressed into the service of the china trade mandarin houqua for whom he acted as intermediary with western merchants young john forbes at eighteen looked older than his years due to early balding and was able to work as peer to men far older than he in his service for russell  company the successor to his uncles’ firm perkins  coleaving china at twenty to return to boston john met and married sarah swain hathaway after being first smitten by her betrothed identical twin before immediately heading back to the far east he returned to settle in milton once and for all three years later jmf arrived in boston to face the financial panic of  and found that russell  co was owed  by bankers who were unable to pay this put russell  co in a very tight situation and jmf was hard put to it to keep the company afloat at the same time brother bennett had a problem similar to russell  co in that people whose notes he had endorsed were unable to pay whereupon bennett returned to china to recoup his losses paul sieman forbes son of jmf’s uncle col james grant forbes followed bennett to china where he succeeded bennett and remained in charge of russell  co for many years russell and co continued to do business with jm forbes  co and ultimately was folded into the younger firmthe chinese merchant houqua with whom russell  co conducted all or most of its business in china became disappointed in some of his dealings with baring bros the london banking house and transferred much of his business to jmf with whom he had had close association in the former years houqua also placed a substantial sum with jmf to be invested for him in us securities this was carried on the books of jmf  co under the designation asi american stock investment the records are incomplete but the amount was probably in the order of  which would be equivalent in today’s value  to about ten million dollars after the death of houqua the account continued for the benefit of his son for many yearsthe earliest surviving jmf  co ledger is dated milton  april  it records transactions with tom wigglesworth geo trumbull joseph cogswell a heard baring bros  co russell sturgis russell  co rb forbes and many others the entries refer to sales of tea and silk the purchase of stock of lowell rail road of the cost of furniture in a house in macao china to be refunded by — hathaway and pin money for jmf’s wife sarah swain forbes jmf reminiscences records that jmf  co was involved with the construction of the ships antelope and coquette and later the auxiliary steamship massachusettsof about  tons one of the first atlantic steamships after several voyages she was sold to the us government for use as a transport in the mexican war and thereafter continued in government service for many yearsin the early years the business was done by a number of individuals taking shares in separate ventures there does not appear to have been a formal partnership until much later in the middle s jmf bought about a onetenth interest in a railroad being built in michigan his associates in this venture were john e thayer william dwight john c green george griswald esastus corning and a young engineer jw brooks who became general superintendent jmf was president at that time the road was one quarter built the individuals interested in michigan central railroad contracted to build the sault st marie ship canal around st mary’s rapids thereby connecting lake superior with the rest of the great lakes mr brooks had charge of the canal construction as well as the building of the railroad but he got it finished within the time required in the contractjmf and others bought extensive timber land and mineral land in the lake superior area including the location of the famous calumet and hecla copper mine jmf recalled that with few exceptions the speculation in timber and mineral lands was a failure considerable work and risk with small net profitin about  wf cary of new york interested jmf in taking on the mt savage co in maryland this property of about  acres contained coal iron ore and limestone it had good housing for personnel one blast furnace in operation and others nearly completed an iron mill foundry brick yard and good railroad connection more capital was needed to commence production of rails etc calls for more capital were frequent and this led to management by jmf in addition to all his other ventures and the china tradein the mids there was a potato crop failure in ireland with widespread starvation reported jmf obtained the use of the steamer jamestown and with the help of the boston community loaded her with potatoes brother bennett took charge and she arrived in ireland in time to benefit the hungryin the s there was a great deal going on there was a shortage of wheat in france the french government of louis napoleon sought the help of baring bros in london russell sturgis then a partner in baring bros asked jmf  co to find wheat jmf had his agents on the michigan central railway quietly buy up wheat the matter had to be kept secret for if it became known that the french government was the purchaser speculators would have tried to buy up the wheat and raise the price the value of the wheat sent was about five million dollars  in a letter to an agent jmf wrote “i have concluded to ship  barrels of wheat to havre please charter ships” jmf was building ships for russell  co at this periodin  jmf was called to make haste to london to raise two million dollars for the michigan central railroad baring bros provided the money later jmf sold his interest in that railroad and the ownership passed to new yorkthe trade with china in tea silk fire crackers hemp and other merchandise continued at a fast pace involving shipments on twenty or more ships the problems of the mt savage iron works continued some new names appear in the book including ej hale as a partner james joy in connection with the railroads and charles russell lowell who was taken in to help with the extra work it was intended that lowell would take on the management of the mt savage enterprise but the civil war intervened note lowell soon became an officer in general sheridan’s cavalry during the shenandoah campaign he had thirteen horses shot under him four of them including “billy” from naushon in the battle of winchester at cedar creek where he was killed his promotion to brigadier general arrived at his deathtoward the end of the s decade the names of hs russell and george tyson appear the former married jmf’s daughter mary hale had been engaged to another daughter ellen randolph forbes there was a bewildering array of railroad and real estate investments to manage and the remnant of the china trade most of the work was done by halea change came with the advent of the civil war jmf himself spent much time in washington but the firm continued its former activities and in addition managed accounts for jmf’s sisters and cousins among them were the children of paul sieman forbes william howell forbes who married dora delano fanny who married odilon barrot mary who married gaston louisphillippe de choiseulpraslin daughter florence who crossed the atlantic to visit her two sisters in france became seasick on the crossing and never risked being seasick again and last paul revere forbes who did not marryjmf’s mission to england during the war was to forestall the delivery of naval vessels to the south is recorded elsewhere secret plans for the relief of fort sumpter were communicated from washington to governor andrew in massachusetts through jmf  co by means of the private cipher many years later jmf grandson william cameron forbes made use of the same code for particularly sensitive communications from the philippines to washington via jmf  cowith the end of the war jmf’s son william h forbes became involved with the firm the china trade was only a remnant but there were plenty of other ventures ej hale hs russell tyson and joy continued their participationat the end of the francoprussian war  paris had been under siege for a long period and starvation was prevalent a number of people subscribed to a relief fund jmf went to washington where he obtained from the authorities in president grant’s administration the assignment of the us navy steamer worcester to carry food to havre under the command of captain perkins and a navy crew in this period jm forbes  co managed the us investments of alexis de toqueville and continued to do so for his widow until  the asi american stock investment account continued for the son of houquathe array of some of the different railroads that had been acquired was consolidated in the chicago burlington  quincy railroad during the civil war and after it had been managed by brooks and joy jmf was chairman of the board in  jmf learned that his long term associate joy had formed a construction company and had executed a contract between it and the railroad which was highly disadvantageous to the railroad and in effect guaranteed a profit to his construction company at the expense of the railroad a few of the other directors were in on the construction company the others knew nothing about it there was a first rate row jmf pointed out the impropriety of this to joy who claimed he could see nothing wrong and that he would run the construction company very economically jmf mobilized a fellow director griswald and his son whf they really stirred up the dust got joy and the others in his camp thrown out the contracts cancelled and the railroad company back on the track jmf tried several new people as president but they had indifferent success then he put in as president his nephew charles e perkins soninlaw of brother bennett after that all was well note many years later in  jmf grandson ralph e forbes travelling with his family to sheridan wyoming was waiting for seats in the dining car when the steward came and told him that a table was reserved for his family explaining that they always reserved a table for any of the family that were on the train jmf  co must have passed the wordin the s there appear to have been two sets of books jmf personal accounts which are concerned with a large number of real estate investments in florida the middle west coal and oil land and many railroad stocks and bonds the purchase of the yacht fayal is recorded in  in a different book the trading

lincoln land co trusts were set up in  for the benefit of jmf’s daughters alice mary and sarah with sons wh forbes and j malcolm forbes and associate nathaniel h stone as trustees the entry of william h forbes into the telephone business as president of the national bell telephone co later called american telephone  telegraph co appears only as occasional purchases of stock in the companyfor many years the office of jm forbes  co was maintained in the sears building at  washington street overlooking the old state house all of the old journals and ledgers were stored there in a locked steel vault when the time came to move in  to  state street it became impractical to move all of the ancient volumes some simply disintegrated in piles of loose leaves on the floor by  vast space was required to store the books which recorded every transaction in the china trade and in the account of every client from the beginning until that date many old records were disposed of the second move to  federal street in  resulted in more attrition and the requirements of various arms of the government for records for their use preempted available space still further there remain a series of representative ledgers now donated to the baker library at the harvard business school and to the massachusetts historical societyin the s accounts and trusts managed for expanding family and the household and other living expenses of the clients occupy the books in that period jm forbes  co acted as a bank and honored checks drawn upon it by any of the many people with accounts joy and hale had gone nathaniel stone was active whf was active with telephone business and as treasurer of milton academy paying the salaries of the teachers and much else the china trade had almost faded it its place are occasional ventures in wheat pig iron etc jmf’s youner son j malcolm forbes appears in the accountings it is not clear when jm forbes  co became a formal partnership it appears that different people came in from time to time to share in particular venturesin the s jmf left more of the work to the younger ones probably nathaniel stone oversaw the routine trust business while whf and j malcolm forbes kept track of their separate enterprises and interests there is a legend that jmf often rode horseback to boston and left his horse in a livery stable several times he went to lunch with a friend and accepted a ride home in a carriage then he could not remember where he had left the horse his groom was sent to look around at the various livery stables to try to find the missing horseafter the death of whf in  several of the younger relatives were briefly associated with jmf  co it has been said that at various times jmf grandsons james s russell and waldo e forbes and cousin john forbes perkins had taken part jmf grandson w cameron forbes was a partner in stone  webster an engineering firm active in building electric utility plants street railways and other large undertakings his relationship with jmf  co was peripheral until the death of j malcolm forbes thereafter although he was serving as governor general in the philippines he maintained an association with the firm after his return from the philippines in  wcf became the dominant figure in jmf  co the principal function of the firm had become the management of investments for a constantly increasing number of people trade in commodities had given way to investments in railroads telephones utilities and other industriesin  the neponset investment co was formed it was what might be called a venture or private equity fund today the purpose of neponset as described by wcf to partner and jmf greatgrandson david cabot forbes was to buy substantial interests in small promising enterprises and to provide wise direction and possibly financing to them among the holdings were dana s courtney co petroleum heat  power co murray  tregurtha and copper range co principal shareholders originally were kidder peabody and jackson curtis but by  jmf  co became the headquarters of neponset and managed it until its final liquidation in   sample account books for some of these firms survive in the baker library at harvardnathaniel stone died in  and family members raymond emerson and then edward cunningham joined the firm wcf continued to be active in the firm until his departure to serve as us ambassador to japan in  after his return from japan he took no further active part in the affairs of jmf  co although he remained a partner until his death in  the first formal partnership agreement that has been found is dated  among its provisions is a prohibition preventing any partner from guaranteeing the obligations of other persons without the unanimous consent of all the members of the firm the same prohibition survived in  it followed the policy of jmf who on starting the firm in  was advised by an older relative to “be not too ready to put thy name on paper” and jmf’s own comment “give money if you have it but be slow to write your name on other people’s paper”after  the partners appear to have beenjm forbes william h forbes j malcolm forbes

client’s goals and our strengths we take time to determine whether we can offer the kinds of support that the client needs and if everything fits we establish an account or family of accounts and move forward in general we expect a new client will bring one to two million dollars into the firm to start the relationship this threshold is not hard and fast and it may be met by a group of related accounts arriving together or a smaller account related to that of an existing client or one for which additional assets are anticipated in future in a family group there are good reasons to maintain smaller satellite accounts for grandchildren or others so we do not charge punitive minimum fees regarding investment we handle small accounts with care and attention selecting exchange traded funds when account size does not permit a full range of individual stock holdings please contact us if you would like to explore the opening of an account or accountsaccount typeswe host a number of account types includingagency accounts standard investment accounts owned by an individual and managed by us on a discretionary basis or with the client retaining final decisionmaking authoritytrust accounts

fee we charge a fee to every client covering our investment and fiduciary activity on their behalf  depending upon account size the fee works out to between  and  of the assets invested by us per year  fees act as a drag on investment returns so we work to keep our fee reasonable and transparent in an industry not known for either  please request our fee schedule to understand the components of the basic fee and to see our fees for tax preparation and executor servicesavoiding fund charges and “loads” we typically purchase individual securities rather than mutual funds for our clients avoiding fund charges for management and administration  when we find that a fund offers an important benefit that we cannot get elsewhere like index exposure to the chinese stock market we select the best fund for the purpose at the lowest expense charge  in today’s competitive markets more and more lowcost options exist for careful buyers  also as a professional buyer we qualify for institutional grade fund shares which don’t carry the entry and exit “loads” that can impose as much as a  onetime cost on retail customersbrokerage commissions the purchase or sale of shares must generally be executed by a registered brokerdealer with a seat on one of the exchanges  we negotiate competitive rates with the brokerdealers we use based on share volume  as an institutional buyerseller we pay a very low pershare fee whereas retail and brokerdealer customers pay a pertrade commission which often costs many times as much  commissions are deducted in computing prices paid and sale proceeds received   jm forbes  co receives security analysis services from the brokerages we use but no share of commission payments investment — jm forbes  co alexander graham bell backed by jm forbes  co investment strategywe use a broad array of tools to work towards two basic yet critical objectives strong riskadjusted returns and preservation of capital to meet these goals we employ a core investment strategy adapted to client needs for some this translates into optimized growth for others maximized income conditioned by individual investment goals time horizon tax situation and risk tolerance we believe that taking a long time horizon provides us with a strategic advantage we position portfolios to benefit from major trends rather than short term market movements stock selectionwe screen a broad universe of equities to find companies that should deliver strong long term price and dividend appreciation some of the attributes we look for include a strong balance sheet sound management competitive products and attractive valuation our search results in an active list of about  companies from which we create a portfolio of  to  names that are continually monitored and evaluated our goal is constant tracking but selective trading so stock holdings might shift only  to  in a given yearinternational investmentwe believe that over the coming years the us will represent a shrinking fraction of the world economy we position client accounts for this by holding nonus stock positions holding positions in us companies with major revenues abroad and through investment in regional indices to capture growth outside this countryfixed income securitieswe actively manage client bond holdings to produce maximum income within specific risk parameters by working with the variables of duration credit risk and return we include taxfree yield for highbracket clients sell positions at times to capture market premiums and work with outside managers and their bond funds to achieve diversified corporate bond yield as with other assets we seek to find stable fixed income positions to avoid frequent trading but will act quickly if underlying factors shiftportfolio adjustmentsthe forces of the economy needs of the client changes in consumer demand and business innovation along with many other factors result in constant movement in the values of assets in each portfolio we continually evaluate these factors looking for validation of our strategies or indications of the need for change we monitor portfolios and intervene to rebalance raise funds or adjust holdings as the situation requiressocially responsible investingclients may wish to invest only in the stock of companies meeting specific criteria for employment practices labor relations environmental impacts and other matters we support this approach by tailoring portfolio holdings to match these concerns we can provide information on specific companies and assist in creating a portfolio that reflects the client’s beliefs legacy — jm forbes  co the mansion house summer residence of jm forbes painted by denman ross estate planningwe work with clients to plan how assets should be passed on to heirs and charities with minimal tax payment to yield an optimal result  we help clients create a plan that is simple and inexpensive to administer and that retains flexibility to

document beneficiaries’ circumstances and needs and by the relevant bodies of lawadministration for childrenchildren cannot hold funds in their own name yet many plans call for gifting by parents to children to reduce the parents’ taxable estate and many trusts are designed to make payments for the benefit of children  partners at jm forbes  co can act as custodian in these situations accepting
