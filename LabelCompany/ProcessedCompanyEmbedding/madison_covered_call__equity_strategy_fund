to marketwatchs slice  covered call as hedge equity and income strategy  madison investments income solutions home  insights  the case for covered calls the case for covered calls covered call writing is a timetested approach that can add income dampen volatility and diversify both equity and fixed income core strategies adding a covered call strategy in a core satellite multiassetclass approach can be accomplished as a hedged equity strategy with an “income kicker” to enhance overall income productiona supplement to a core largecap strategy especially late in the market cycle when valuations are longinthetooth and price action is volatile as a means of boosting income and mitigating downside riska betteryielding alternative to a high yield bond allocationwe believe that investors are wellserved by strongly considering the addition of an incomeproducing covered call strategy in virtually all market environments and multiasset class strategies madison’s active call writingactive stock selection approach provides more opportunity for premium income and alpha from underlying security selection than common passive call writing what is a covered call strategy a covered call strategy owns shares of a publicly traded company while selling or writing call options on the same assets call options give the buyer of the option the right to purchase the stock at a predetermined “strike price” within a set time frame typically nine months or less selling call options produces income to the portfolio which can be distributed or reinvested known as a “buywrite” strategy the income may act as a source of yield to the investor or can be reinvested to help offset losses in a market decline several peerreviewed studies suggest that a covered call strategy performs at least inline with the sp  index over longer periods of time while realizing lower standard deviation of returns  the return profile is appealing but investors must be aware that the performance of covered call strategies differs with market environments the covered call strategy tends to underperform in steadily or sharplyrising markets as the income generated by covered call writing is offset by the opportunity cost of having appreciating underlying assets called away income generated by selling covered calls in this environment tends to constitute the bulk of returns supplemented by limited capital gains on the underlying stocks downside protection in sideways and down market environments covered call writing tends to outperform due to the significant income generated from selling calls as well as dividend income from the underlying stocks and any alpha generated by the security selections of an active manager of course even with the downside protection provided by the call premium and dividends  there is a greater likelihood that the options will expire worthless out of the money in this environment leaving the portfolio holding the stock along with the premium income while a steep market decline such as that experienced in  can result in a negative total return in a covered portfolio its performance should exceed that of its underlying assets by roughly the amount of the premiums minus expenses we would argue that the current environment of full valuations and market volatility is favorable for covered call writing strategies the income advantage a primary attraction of writing covered calls is immediate income the premium can vary depending on the security involved the price history of the stock and the market environment a volatile stock will likely offer higher call premiums and the overall premiums for calls will rise as overall market volatility rises this pattern is popularly measured by the chicago board options exchange market volatility index “vix” which tracks the implied volatility of sp  index options the premium income from writing these calls can provide an alternate method for generating yield  a report published in january  gives a sense of the income potential of covered call writing showing  historic monthly yield of the bxm between june   and december   option income is usually taxed as shortterm gains making the strategy best suited for taxdeferred and taxexempt assets but depending on the length of the option income may also be taxed as longterm gain potential for positive return in a flat market a covered call strategy can be a powerful alternative strategy for performance in a flat market writing calls with a strike price outofthemoney eg  on a  stock allows room for capital appreciation while earning the call premium outofthemoney calls have a strike price higher than the current market price of the underlying security across a diversified portfolio of stocks on which call options are written the premium income can boost returns above a stockonly portfolio in a year in which the traditional stock indices are up nominally in the past there have been long periods of flat returns in the equity market these are the periods in which a covered call allocation can be a significant driver of valueadded returns the least conducive environment for a covered call strategy is a steeply advancing market since much of the gain on underlying securities will be truncated by the securities getting called away at strike prices lower than the advancing market price  an analytical review of a covered call strategy a study by goldman sachs in january  reviewed  years of covered call trades  and concluded “overwriting added to returns and lowered the risk of diversified portfolios” the extent of the advantage was quantified as  annually with a reduction of standard deviation of monthly returns by  these results were predicated on selling  outofthemoney onemonth covered calls on sp  stocks with liquid options in addition the study found better results from writing calls on largecap over smallcap companies while there was no significant difference between value and growth stocks the results were also based on writing covered calls on a large number of stocks with a specific  outofthemoney prescription using onemonth options while this methodology differs from madison’s covered call writing strategy it lends credence to our belief that a carefully managed covered call strategy has the potential to produce attractive returns reduce risk and provide meaningful additional income madison’s covered call management active stock selection – madison starts with a growthatareasonableprice garp approach to build the underlying covered call equity portfolio the process seeks to select highquality companies which have solid balance sheets excellent profitability strong management and elicit confidence in continued profitability we seek to purchase such companies when their valuations are reasonable and when we see the available option premiums for the stock as attractive we focus on larger companies market caps of  billion or more that have a history of excellent return on capital strong longterm growth rates and positive cash generation historically the majority of our investments have been focused on the financial technology consumer health care energy and industrial sectors  our active stock selection process which includes rigorous fundamental analysis of all portfolio candidates results in a highconviction portfolio of  stocks we seek to avoid overpriced and speculative issues through our valuation discipline we expect the stock component of our portfolio to show lower volatility and better downside protection than the market in general  active call writing – we purchase individual stock options rather than index options because we believe individual stock options can offer higher premiums typically we write outofthemoney calls which allow for the potential for upside participation if the underlying stock price advances when selecting options we look at the outlook for the underlying stock the outlook for the overall market the implied volatility history of the stock and the absolute and annualized total return potential for each stockoption combination we often have multiple calls written for the same stock in the portfolio giving us a range of strike prices and option expiration dates why madison covered call  madison has been a leader in covered call management since  the madison covered call and strategic equity fund
