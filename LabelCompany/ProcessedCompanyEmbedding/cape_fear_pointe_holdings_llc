discussed by new hanover countys technical review committee this week could add  apartment units to the area’s list of affordable housing options but first they have to gain county approvals and compete for federal dollars that would make the projects viable both unit complexes are planned by separate developers for different properties on carolina beach road aaronfield cove which at one time was expected to be called abbington cove would be developed at  carolina beach road by brock ventures inc and kent place holdings llc the developers applied for but did not win federal housing tax credits for the apartments last year but kent place holdings has applied again this year   connelly development nc llc has also applied for the credits for woodridge pointe an apartment complex planned for  carolina beach road and stonebrook apartments another unit apartment community that would be built at  village road in leland for developers the credits offset the cost of building apartments that allow tenants to pay less than the current market rate “we see a lot of young people that have maybe just gotten out of school and are getting started in their careers and they’re not making big dollars  they can’t afford   a month in rent but they can afford    in rent” said bill chamblin who works in connelly’s development division the rents at woodridge pointe could start at about  for a onebedroom apartment chamblin said that amount does not include an estimated  utility allowance he said chamblin said that about  percent of connelly development’s business involves putting together affordable housing projects using the federal housing tax credit program competing for those dollars in north carolina and south carolina based in lexington south carolina connelly also has an office in durham chamblin said the connelly family of companies includes connelly builders inc in  connelly development was awarded nearly  in credits to build westgate senior apartments in leland according to the nc housing finance agency the agency’s lists of funded projects in the state show that no newly planned apartment communities in new hanover county have been awarded the tax credits since  when unit lockwood village on south college road received them in the amount of  an announcement about which projects receive the credits won’t take place until august but the county’s
