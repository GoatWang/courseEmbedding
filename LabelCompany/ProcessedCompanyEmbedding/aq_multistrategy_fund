hallissey     openended liquid alternatives have overshadowed their closedend siblings over the last few years as the liquid alternatives industry continues to grow both in terms of assets and number this is not a surprise as a growing majority in the hedge fund industry see the rise of mutual fund offerings as a trend that is still in its infancy for a growing number of retail shoppers the daily liquidity fund of hedge funds fohf industry now comprises  funds which manage close to  billion compared to the eight funds that managed just over  billion this time last year the majority of the firms that have entered the openended market so far are billion dollar club firms with permal asset management abbey capital and rothschild and larch lane among the new entrants over the course of the last  months  click here for table however closedend rics registered with the sec under the  act which are generally aimed at the highnet worth market have also experienced growth the industry grew by  in the month period to  march  to manage  billion as funds of hedge funds continued to deploy hedge fund strategies within a regulated framework in order to reach a broader investor base when combined openended and closedend rics total  billion see table right the  growth and median return of  over the same month period suggest that the industry is continuing to gain momentum and that the landscape is still developing in terms of breadth and diversification however the total asset growth rate does not appear to be representative of the entire industry as the divergence between the individual rics’ asset growth ranged from  on the positive side to  at the other end of the spectrum all of the rics achieved positive returns over the period but  of the funds saw outflows – despite making high returns in a number of cases the median growth rate of the industry was  compared to  in the previous year and this figure provides an alternative indication of the growth of the closedend  act fohfs the industry grew despite the total number of rics falling to  compared to  in the previous year existing rics were the main contributors to the growth rate and the funds with the largest asset growth grew by over      ray nolte there were five new master funds launched over the month period including the second offering from skybridge capital and the first products from steben  co and pine grove asset management of the  rics listed in the table of sec registered fohfs  are master funds while the remaining  are feeder funds that differ from the master fund in terms of fees and tax structures depending on the investor taxexempt investors in the us for example would utilise a taxexempt feeder such as a tei fund that feeds into the master fund the underlying hedge fund portfolios of the feeder funds are managed at the master fund level and as such the total asset figure includes the assets of the master funds only to avoid double counting the expenses and return of the feeder funds are included in the table to present the differences that occur across the master and feeder tranches skybridge capital manages the largest of the closedend rics and half of its total assets invested in hedge funds – which stood at  billion at the midyear point according to the investhedge billion dollar club survey – are invested via these structures the largest of the rics skybridge multiadviser hedge fund portfolios had  billion in assets to the end of march following a growth rate of  over the month period compared to the fund’s return of  the fund is also one of the oldest rics with an official launch date of  under the citi brand the  deal with citi brought in the ric offering and an investment team led by ray nolte perhaps helping to further boost the brand is the starstudded skybridge alternatives salt conference held annually in las vegas since  also as an independent firm skybridge has historically had access to multiple distribution platforms including merrill lynch ubs wells fargo and raymond james among others  investhedge october  the growth in the asset flow has come from a very broad base both from the individual side and institutions explains nolte managing partner and chief investment officer at skybridge the biggest positive of the rics structure comes when dealing with individual investors such as accredited and highnet worth investors

of the product has also been helpful in the growth of the fund as there is a greater comfort level for both individuals and institutions as we report the fund’s positions and holdings with the sec every quarter skybridge launched its second ric the skybridge g ii fund in january of this year largely to meet investor demands which came from us registered investment advisors rias in particular rias generally manage their client’s entire portfolio that would most likely include equities bonds and alternatives nolte says investors liked all the attributes of a registered  product but required a more diversified product than the skybridge multiadviser hedge fund portfolios investors were saying we really like the fund and the tactical dynamic and high conviction nature of how you allocate

portfolio based on our thematic point of view the new fund had  million in assets as of march  invested across three categories that include event driven  directional equity  and relative value  by comparison skybridge multiadviser hedge fund portfolios allocation to event driven was much higher at  and the allocation to equity was much lower at  while relative value was slightly lower at  overlapping names in both skybridge portfolios includes the jana nirvana fund with a little over  allocation in each programme the trian partners fund paulson recovery fund and the york select fund

highest growth rate at  the fund launched in october  and during the reporting period surpassed its first year anniversary which can often result in a pickup in assets as potential investors often

that offered monthly liquidity but both funds have been redeemed since december  along with anthion partners and pershing square two of the funds’ underlying funds now provide monthly liquidity with

that contributed  million to the overall asset total the aq master fund formerly named o’connor funds of funds master launched on  july  ubs alternative  quantitative investments renamed all of their rics over the course of  from o’connor funds of funds to aq the aq master fund classified its investments into three categories including equity hedged an  slice of the assets at the end of march  with the largest allocation to viking global equities iii at  while bronson point partners and pennant windward fund both made up  of the  million fund the steben select multistrategy master fund launched in august  and had the strongest return of the new entrants up by  to the end of march the portfolio was employed across five strategies and like the aq masters fund allocated the largest slice to equity longshort which stood at  of the total investment portfolio followed by global macro with  equity marketneutral at  fixedincome relative value at  and multistrategy at  pine grove asset management which was acquired by man group earlier this year also entered the closedend space with the launch of the pine grove alternative institutional fund in january pine grove took deliberate steps to convert a private unregistered fund into a registered ’ act fund format since the pine grove alternative institutional fund acquired the assets of its predecessor fund it will be one of the only ’ act funds that benefits from a year performance history explains matthew stadtmauer president of pine grove asset management the portfolio’s largest allocations were to credit and distressed strategies hedged credit accounted for  of the  million assets in the fund with the largest allocations going to anchorage capital partners and fir tree capital opportunity fund our portfolio construction is positioned to handle a potential rise in interest rates as the managers we allocate to usually display negative correlation to high quality bonds explains tom williams chief investment officer of pine grove asset management other brandname multimanager firms actively launching offerings include permal the permal hedge strategies portfolio was launched on  june  and permal hedge fund strategies i which launched in february  began investing as a feeder fund in permal hedge strategies portfolio along with permal hedge strategies fund ii that launched on the  june  similar to the skybridge portfolios the permal hedge strategies portfolio invests in trian partners as well as funds managed by york capital management and paulson  co with allocations to the paulson credit opportunities and york investments funds the fund invests the majority of the assets in fixedincome hedge strategies which stood at  at the end of march and the strategy was the leading contributor to the yearoveryear performance the permal hedge strategies portfolio returned  between june  and march  while the permal hedge fund strategies i was up by  for the full year a newer launch that missed the cutoff in our earlier survey is the evanston alternative opportunities fund which launched over the summer and has gathered an additional  million for evanston capital management evanston was founded in  by david wagner who was formerly the vice president and chief investment officer at northwestern university in evanston illinois overall number of rics falls fund turnover rises the total number of rics fell as  funds left the rankings including two of the oldest rics the advantage advisers whistler fund advised by oppenheimer asset management that launched in july  and the lazard alternative strategies fund which launched in september  in november  the board of managers approved a plan of liquidation for the advantage advisers whistler fund to terminate its operations and liquidate at the end of  at the same time the lazard alternative strategies fund was reorganised into the lazard alternative strategies  fund as a result of the reorganisation the lazard alternative strategies  fund acquired all the net assets of the lazard alternative strategies fund accounting for the  growth rate of the lazard alternative strategies  fund which had  million in assets at the end of march  compared to  million in march  the blue rock market neutral fund old field master fund cantor opportunistic alternatives fund multimanager master portfolio advised by genspring family offices and the blackrock alternatives allocation master portfolio are the other funds that are no longer listed in the table as a result of liquidations and mergers the gmam absolute return strategies fund i managed by general motors investment management is also no longer listed in the table the  billion ric which was previously listed in the rankings grew by  in the year to march  but has been removed from this year’s table as the company uses the ric structure to manage the pension fund’s hedge fund allocation and does not accept outside investment the total ric asset figure for march  has been readjusted to reflect this so as to ensure that the correct asset growth has been calculated the portfolio turnover of the rics was higher than in the previous two years on both an average and median basis the average portfolio turnover was  for the period to march  compared to  the previous year however the  turnover figure for the gottex multiasset endowment master fund which invests in common stocks etfs and mutual funds as well as hedge funds was the main contributor to this high figure the median figure portfolio turnover was  only slightly above the median portfolio turnover of  in the previous year the aq multistrategy fund had the second highest portfolio turnover at  as the equity hedged allocation was increased from  in the previous year to  to march  the largest allocations in the equity hedged category went to two new managers the tiger eye fund and shellback offshore fund the portfolio turnover of the cpg jpmorgan alternative strategies fund was also over  despite only having seven underlying managers davidson kempner and double black diamond were redeemed over the period and were replaced by atlas global and citadel kensington global strategies fund the rics offer an insight into the investing trends of fohfs as they share a number of common holdings and it is interesting to see the disparity in the categorisation of the funds across the different advisers for instance king street capital silver point capital and anchorage capital partners were among the most featured funds but all three funds were categorised across the distressed credit or eventdriven allocations depending on the ric portfolio all three of these funds were listed in the portfolios of the  million aetos capital distressed investment strategies fund the  million grosvenor registered multistrategy master fund and the new pine grove alternative institutional fund likewise with eton park the fund is listed as a manager in a number of the rics but the fund’s categorisation in the various portfolios ranges across multistrategy event driven and arbitrage pelham longshort features in the equity allocations of nine of the portfolios while blue trend is listed in either the managed futures or macro allocations of eight rics both hedge funds featured in the  million morgan stanley institutional fund of hedge funds ric and offered monthly liquidity another manager in the morgan stanley institutional fund of hedge funds ric is the magnetar capital fund which appears in seven of the ric portfolios including the  million alternative investment partners absolute return fund other magnetar funds that contributed to the  return of the alternative investment partners absolute return fund portfolio include the magnetar equity opportunities fund and the magnetar global event driven fund luxor capital partners tybourne equity trient global macro and monarch debt recovery fund all featured in six of the ric portfolios and all the funds were listed among the underlying managers of the  million asgi aurora opportunities fund corvex partners and senator global opportunity fund also had investments from over six of the rics both funds contributed to the  return of the  million nt alpha strategies fund along with the trient global macro fund wide range of fees and fee structures fee structure is an important differentiating factor between hedge funds and mutual funds the total expense ratio is the figure that investors need to consider in the mutual fund industry compared to the management and performance fees that are generally utilised by the hedge fund industry the expense ratio of the rics in the table ranges from  at the highest end of the spectrum to  at the lowest with the median expense ratio figure at  of those master rics that have an associated feeder fund the feeder funds generally have higher expense ratios as these facilitate certain investor types the tei feeder funds appear to have the highest expense ratios as the hatteras core alternatives tei institutional fund the endowment tei fund and the rochdale high yield alternative strategies fund tei all have expense ratios of over  hatteras core alternatives tei institutional fund’s expense ratio was  more than double the  of the hatteras master fund on the other hand the difference between the rochdale high yield alternative strategies fund tei expense ratio of  and the master fund at  is significantly lower the expense ratio of the arden sage multistrategy tei institutional fund is the lowest of the tei feeder funds at  with a return of  arden’s ric was invested across seven strategies including equity event multievent driven and credit event the largest holding was to lakewood capital partners which accounted for  of members’ capital the lowest fee among the rics is with one of the feeder funds offered by blackstone alternative asset management which with nearly  billion in overall assets is the largest fund of hedge funds group in the world the latest ric fund in the blackstone stable was launched in  and has approximately  million in assets and charges  to underlying investors who have seen an annualised gain of  as investors look to alternatives to diversify their portfolios the hedge fund investing industry is continuing to look at ways of diversifying the investor base by offering products in differing structures looking at the registration filings entrust partners appears to be ready to enter this market by offering a registered product for their investors without constraints the closedend ric remains a useful tool to achieve those business development aims unlike their openended counterparts the closedend ric structure allows fohfs to access a much wider investor base without
