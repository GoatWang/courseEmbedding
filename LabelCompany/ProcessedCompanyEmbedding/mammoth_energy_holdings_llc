in mammoth llc to mammoth inc in exchange for shares of common stock of mammoth inc and mammoth llc became our whollyowned subsidiary industry overview the oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of longterm shortterm and cyclical trends including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling completion and related services and products budget the oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions political instability in oil producing countries government regulations both in the united states and elsewhere levels of customer demand the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control demand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in the third quarter of  continued into february  when the closing price of oil reached a year low of  per barrel on february   the low commodity price environment caused a reduction in the drilling completion and other production activities of most of our customers and their spending on our products and services the reduction in demand and the resulting oversupply of many of the services and products we provide has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for our products and services and has had a negative impact on the utilization of our services this overall trend with respect to our customers activities and spending has continued in  however oil prices have increased since the year low recorded on february   reaching  per barrel in june  and have ranged from  to  per barrel during september  as commodity prices have begun to recover we have experienced an increase in activity if near term commodity prices stabilize at current levels and recover further we expect to experience an increase in demand for our services and products particularly in our completion and production natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling businesses our remote accommodation revenue remained stable through the third quarter of  however we currently project that our remote accommodation revenues will decrease in the fourth quarter of  if we are unable to replace one customer that represented approximately  of our remote accommodation services during the first nine months of  when it completes the construction phase of its project which is currently estimated to occur in november  nongaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a supplemental nongaap financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization expense impairment of longlived assets equity based compensation and other nonoperating income or expense net which is comprised of the gain or loss on disposal of longlived assets as well as charges associated with mammoth partners proposed public offering in  we exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at adjusted ebitda because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted ebitda should not be considered as and alternative to or more meaningful than net income loss or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a companys financial performance such as a companys cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets none of which are components of adjusted ebitda our computations of adjusted ebitda may not be
