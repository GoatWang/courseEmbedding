box reveals a funds investment style for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii moderate greater than  and less than equal to  years iii extensive greater than  yearsunsubsidized yields reflect

article brands are proliferating rapidly companies must now bring them under control in theory at least most marketers recognize that they should run their brands as a portfolio managing brands in a coordinated way helps a company to avoid confusing its consumers investing in overlapping productdevelopment and marketing efforts and multiplying its brands at its own rather than its competitors expense moreover killing off weaker or illfitting parts of the product range—an important tenet of brandportfolio management though not one that should be applied at all times—frees marketers to focus resources on the stronger remaining brands and to position them distinctively it thus reduces the complexity of the marketing effort and counteracts the decreasing efficiency and effectiveness of traditional media and distribution channels theory however is one thing practice another marketers today face heavy pressure to produce growth in an era of fragmenting customer needs understandably they often react by expanding rather than pruning their brand offerings after all killing tired brands and curbing the launch of new ones isnt easy when the remaining portfolio must capture nearly half of a discontinued brands volume merely to break even marketers also worry about the repercussions of using a portfolio approach and making the wrong call companies today are more likely to punish brand managers for missing an emerging opportunity than for failing when they try to exploit it for these and other reasons brands including subbrands and line extensions are proliferating at a breakneck pace in industries such as beverages consumer durables food household goods and pharmaceuticals  roughly threequarters of the fortune  consumer goods companies manage more than  brands each from  to  the number of brands increased by  percent in the pharmaceutical industry by  percent in white goods and travel and leisure by  percent in the automotive industry and by at least  percent in food household goods and beverages among other ills this explosion makes it harder to define customer segments and positioning objectives consistently consider for example the predicament of automakers that have stuffed their brand portfolios with dozens of alltoosimilar sport utility vehicles discerning indeed is the consumer who can pick out meaningful differences among them costs reflect the profusion of brands as well since companies with too many of them suffer from increased marketing and operational complexity and from the associated diseconomies of scale if marketers are to thrive they must resist the compulsion to launch new and protect old brands and instead shepherd fewer stronger ones in a more synchronized way anheuserbusch for example uses a coordinated approach it recognizes that customers shift to different beers from lower to higherend or fuller to lighter brews for example and its portfolio strategy aims to keep those customers within its family of brands when they do so procter  gamble has carried out a successful global rationalization over the past few years and several other consumer goods companies have achieved rates of revenue growth two to five times higher than their historic norms and saved  percent of their overall marketing expenditures by managing their brand portfolios more effectively how do such companies do so in part by establishing clear roles relationships and boundaries for their brands and then within these guidelines giving individual brand managers plenty of scope subject to oversight from one person who is responsible for the portfolio as a whole topdown goals such as pgs recent desire to prune brands that arent toptwo performers in their categories also play an important role—provided that the goals are informed by a deep understanding of consumer needs in addition since new portfolio strategies frequently prompt reactions from competitors and have unanticipated consequences companies will have to change the organization to facilitate quick coordinated responses for the portfolio as a whole and for individual brands robust metrics that highlight unexpected shifts are critical to both exhibit  more brands lower revenues the portfolio problem its easy to see why marketers resist the portfolio approach to brands after all entrepreneurial brand managers not portfolio managers built most of the worlds great ones such as tide pg and cheerios general mills in the united states and persil henkel in europe even if most of these brands are part of portfolios today a portfolio approach wasnt necessary when the pioneers were developing smaller numbers of brands but managing them has become more difficult since companies in maturing sectors have not only used new brands and products to pursue continued growth but also resisted pruning existing ones in hopes of maintaining market share cash flows and longlived consumer franchises mergers which became much more common during the s and s  global merger activity increased by  percent a year from  to  compounded the problem all too often an acquisition motivated by the allure of a specific brand such as pepsicos purchase of quaker oats to obtain gatorade also brought a legacy—from breakfast cereals like capn crunch to dinner favorites like ricearoni—that complicated the portfolio managers task although the search for growth provided the main impetus for launching new brands and sheltering old ones most industries failed to achieve the desired result in confectionery for example the number of brands increased by more than  percent in recent years but overall revenue and volume havent kept pace exhibit  most individual candy brands have a smaller market share than they did a few years ago in addition an evergrowing number of brands imposes complexity costs affecting the entire life cycle from product development and sourcing more rd resources to manufacturing and distribution more labor schedules to coordinate to sales and channel management more training and more brands than the sales force can really focus on to marketing and promotions more documentation and more coordination of marketing vendors and agencies the demanding nature of the solution makes matters even more difficult restoring order calls for centralization and restraint both of which run against the grain of even the most sophisticated marketing organizations  for a summary of the promise and pitfalls of brand consolidation see lars finskud egil hogna trond riiber knudsen and richard törnblom brand consolidation makes a lot of economic sense the mckinsey quarterly  number  pp – brand moves that look economically attractive or strategically tidy may founder because of the complex interrelationships between products and segments or a backlash from consumers volkswagens impressive success at repositioning seat and koda auto for instance raised the bar for some of volkswagens core products such as the golf even proctor  gamble had to backtrack on its effort to replace fairy dishwasher detergent with dawn in germany after its market share in dish soaps dropped to  percent from  percent in less than two years crafting a portfolio strategy to deal with the mess companies need a flexible portfolio approach sensitive to consumers and current brands alike while bold topdown declarations of intent do have a place marketers will be better served by first clarifying the needs that brands could satisfy and then assessing both the economic attractiveness of meeting them and their fit with the positioning of existing brands only then should marketers move to increase the portfolios value by making strategic decisions on the restructuring acquisition divestiture or launch of brands start with the consumer the starting point for marketers is to define categories as consumers do over the past decade or so pepsico for example has recognized that customers choose among all nonalcoholic beverages not just carbonated ones to satisfy their need for refreshment it has therefore made acquisitions gatorade sobe tropicana developed new products amp aquafina and completed several joint ventures the one with starbucks led to the bottled frappuccino strong operating results have followed  pepsis share of the us noncarbonated segment increased from  percent in  to  percent in  at the same time cocacolas share increased to  percent from  percent these figures exclude tropicanas  percent fruit juice products had they been included pepsis lead over coke would be even higher pepsi has the numberone brand in water juices iced tea and sports drinks successes such as pepsicos—as well as kelloggs winning move from breakfasts to nutritional minimeals and procter  gambles repositioning of olay from moisturizing products to all skin and beautycare offerings—result from a judicious deliberate broadening of a companys frame of reference the revised view of consumer needs is neither too narrow and category constrained nor too broad and conceptual moving gradually often helps companies to strike such a balance pepsico for instance initially expanded its frame of reference from cola drinks to all carbonated beverages and only later moved into nonalcoholic nondairy ones the fit between the redefined frame of reference and existing organizational capabilities also provides a reality check when an expanded frame of reference implies brandextension opportunities that a company cant easily seize by itself it must weigh the benefits of acquisitions or partnerships to broaden its portfolio against their complexity costs within a given frame of reference marketers need a disciplined way of evaluating their brands opportunities one is to scrutinize need states—the intersection between what customers want and how they want it exhibit  many marketers think about need states from time to time but most define their brands by product for instance an economy brand or consumer segment young adults say instead of consumer needs people consume this brand when they want something cheap dont care about nutrition and cant spend time cooking at home although thinking through need states is demanding it often suggests new ways for existing brands to satisfy the needs of customers thereby helping marketers avoid the common trap of launching a new brand every time they want to enter a market exhibit  analyzing the customers need states when a global brewer scrutinized the need states of its customers for example it discovered that there was no single import segment a wide range of people bought imports across several need states such findings show that the one brand per customer segment approach can be mistaken if the occasions when consumers use a product largely shape their needs it is often appropriate to offer the target consumer a number of brands balance economic opportunity with brand reality need states are more than descriptive tools they also represent market opportunities to evaluate them marketers must begin by estimating their size since need states rarely coincide with conventional market definitions it is often necessary to piece together known segmentshare and channelmix figures creatively category consumer product and packaging trends can point to the likely future size of need states and potential shifts in the intensity of competition can shed light on future profitability the resulting profit pool map exhibit  reveals attractive opportunities for brands to target exhibit  mapping future profits through need state analysis but make no mistake a profit map is no portfolio strategy for starters to target some seemingly attractive need states it may be necessary to reposition brands so much that they no longer appeal to their original consumers such considerations help explain toyota motors  decision to launch lexus as a separate brand and not as a new toyota model by contrast mazda motors muchpraised millenia luxury car struggled with its brand identity from introduction in  until it was phased out in  to avoid positioning mistakes marketers must understand each brands unique contribution to the portfolio mapping its current brands against the universe of relevant need states is a helpful starting point the most valuable insights often emerge when marketers use statistical tools and market research to assess the relationship between the things customers value in a given need state and the attributes that differentiate the brand for them  such an analysis is also frequently the starting point for efforts to set individual brand strategies in fact the mapping of brands against need states represents the intersection of portfolio and singlebrand strategies for more on individual brand strategies and statistical tools see nora a aufreiter david elzinga and jonathan w gordon better branding the mckinsey quarterly  number  pp – combining this consumer knowledge with conventional metrics such as each brands market share within a variety of need states as well as the proportion of each brands volume that a need state represents helps clarify the attainable opportunities for each brand and the amount of differentiation or overlap within the portfolio many companies mapping out their portfolios find that they have at least one relatively weak brand some choose to retain and improve underperformers rather than jettisoning them or targeting them toward new customers but that approach carries risks frequently companies that hold on to underperformers cant really support all of their brands and thus have to make small cuts in the resources allotted to each thereby undermining the performance of their portfolios one benefit of developing a profit map is that it helps catalyze more dramatic action by painting a clear picture of the economic opportunities companies forgo if they dont take the portfolio approach make the tough choices marketers generally have two options for achieving their portfolio goals first they can restructure their brands by repositioning those that have lost relevance to the target segments by consolidating two or more mature brands competing for the same consumers or by divesting a brand that absorbs more resources than it contributes and holds little promise of a turnaround restructuring doesnt involve pursuing customers whom a company doesnt currently serve rather it means changing the brands that serve its present customers the other option is to change the portfolio to drive new growth by launching a new brand by acquiring or licensing one from another company or by redefining an existing brand to target a new category of customers restructuring is scary because it involves modifying brands and consumer attitudes but though careful management is certainly needed to restructure brands without losing customers the risk of adding new brands or categories is often greater—and so are the investments valuecreating brand acquisitions are few and far between roughly threequarters of all new brands fail and stretching brands into any new category is risky because its easy to go too far and lose their identity brand managers are accustomed to making headlines through launches or acquisitions but those tactics are usually the last to consider for a portfolio strategy of course companies can rework their brand portfolios in a number of ways which are often interconnected—if one brand is repositioned that may have ripple effects for others—so it isnt practical to evaluate each brand move in isolation marketers must therefore develop and compare a manageable number of plausible scenarios that bundle compatible moves each scenario should involve only a few of them exhibit  more than four or five can overwhelm a marketing organization and confuse consumers to define those moves a company must make decisions about issues such as the right number of brands—and which to have—and the advisability of offering umbrella brands with subbrands beneath them rather than a medley of individual ones exhibit  adjusting a brand portfolio through carefully defined moves several rules of thumb help marketers to avoid playing a trialanderror game first they can build their strategies around leading brands if wellknown ones are financially successful their role in the portfolio shouldnt change much but when they underperform its critical to adjust their positioning before recrafting the roles of other brands second marketers must ensure that their sophisticated and ambitious portfolio ideas are feasible in view of internal resource constraints and likely competitive reactions finally they should know when a brand is the consumers second choice research techniques such as conjoint analysis can help them learn whether two or more adjacent brands are taking share and margins from each other or from competitors for an international industrialequipment manufacturer building the portfolio around a leading global brand has been a straightforward affair in many markets but problematic where the companys other brands are powerful leaders in those countries the company makes styling adjustments and includes features valued locally even though they increase the complexity of its offerings it also found that in some markets it sold similar products for different prices the resulting cannibalization—people usually bought the cheaper offering—was costly by clarifying brand roles making local adjustments when necessary and doubling the number of shared parts in products the manufacturer has raised its portfolio sales by  percent in a stagnant market and cut its development costs by up to  percent managing the portfolio getting strategy right is only part of the battle companies must also make organizational changes if they are to adapt their brand portfolios quickly to shifting trends competitive responses mergers and newproduct launches while also managing the natural life cycle of their brands since taking action with one often means doing so with another companies must appoint a dynamic portfolio manager who can ensure that the whole portfolio moves nimbly how can a company centralize this kind of authority without handcuffing the managers of its individual brands that depends largely on how it constitutes the portfolio managers role the crucial thing is that the person who holds it must have the ability to determine on an ongoing basis how well individual brands are fulfilling their part in the portfolio strategy and whether the strategy itself still makes sense the portfolio manager must of course have certain traits and skills but much will also be required of the organization including unity of purpose across functions and businesses and robust metrics for tracking performance structural options to articulate and monitor a brandportfolio strategy the portfolio manager must have the authority the marketing skills the facts and the analyses to sway the brand managers sometimes the chief marketing officer the vice president for marketing or a person who rose through the ranks of the marketing organization and then became general manager of a business unit can serve as portfolio manager while still carrying out his or her primary duties the support team might consist primarily of swing analysts who have some responsibility for individual brands but can be called up by the portfolio manager for major events such as a newproduct launch or the acquisition of several brands at the extreme brand teams might have a fluid membership in other cases—particularly in industries characterized by rapidly changing tastes fashion many subbrands autos or rapid consolidation—a fulltime portfoliomanagement structure may be warranted one global automobile manufacturer relies on a central organization to coordinate its brand strategy pricing is one key area of focus because although each of the portfolios car lines has a specific role that its list price reflects differences in base features and functions make applestoapples comparisons difficult the central team gets around this problem by creating virtual cars with identical features across brands setting the value of each brand according to its role in the portfolio and then building in or stripping out standard features to arrive at real pricing essential tasks whatever structure a company selects it is vital for the portfolio manager to channel the entrepreneurial energies of the brand managers in the right direction and when necessary to make them trim their sails or change course building agreement the portfolio manager must get individual brand groups to endorse the portfolio strategy formally incentives that reward them for the whole portfolios performance help to ensure that they dont revise their brands strategies when no one is watching meanwhile the portfolio manager should reconcile the portfolio strategy with functional agendas elsewhere in the company it might for example be necessary to set up focused rd initiatives to fill gaps in the brand portfolio to work with the finance organization to include key brand metrics in annual and longrange plans and to have the sales organization develop a calendar and resourceallocation guidelines the calendar would be linked to key dates in the strategys rollout and the guidelines would include directions for presenting brands to intermediaries such as grocery stores or car dealers tracking progress measuring whether each brand is fulfilling its role in the portfolio is crucial standard metrics show whether consumers know about have tried or ever considered purchasing a brand their attitudes toward it for instance is it worth paying more for rates for converting prospects into customers and for retaining customers in target segments and levels of customer satisfaction other metrics should be tailored to the strategic goals for each brand if the managers of several brands in the same portfolio track identical metrics the company often has a problem either the metrics are at too high a level to shed light on the relative performance of different brands or the brands are positioned so closely together that the strategy needs a rethink an appliance maker introducing a new lowerpriced line to its portfolio for example found it helpful to track productmix changes by sales channels it discovered that in some of them its existing premium products were positioned close to the new line a problem that leads to cannibalization and falling margins this timely channel data prompted the company to stop the bleeding quickly wellconceived metrics also clarify major competitive moves in the value end of the appliance industry for instance lg electronics and samsung have made advances that are prompting several other manufacturers to rethink the role of value offerings in their own portfolios although the annual planning process is a natural time for such dialogues brand managers should raise red flags whenever these issues appear particularly if the portfolio managers likely response to them includes adding a brand when market researchers recognize a new consumer trend the portfolio manager must get involved to avoid a familiar outcome a number of similar products for similar customers and need states marketers are uneasy about rigorous brandportfolio management but overcoming this mindset can pay big dividends for companies that succeed setting the portfolio strategy isnt a onetime event its a living breathing part of daytoday

service please be aware that the ability to realize significant tax benefits from taxloss harvesting depends upon a variety of factors and no assurance can be offered that a particular investor will in fact realize significant tax benefitsthis page illustrates the possible benefits of reinvesting federal income tax savings if the portfolio weights associated with a hypothetical portfolio of moderate risk held in a taxable account had been in existence and employed for the period specified and does not reflect actual results the hypothetical example is designed to allow investors to understand and evaluate the application of tax loss harvesting to a portfolio by seeing the potential benefits from federal income tax savings that may have occurred during a certain time period while the hypothetical results reflect the general application of tax loss harvesting they have certain limitations and should not be considered indicative of future results by any client in particular the example results do not reflect actual federal income tax savings in an actual account so there is no guarantee that in fact an actual account would have achieved the results shown moreover the potential federal income tax savings do not reflect investments outside the program that could impact the utilization or realization of such savings the hypothetical example results also assume that federal income tax rates would have remained static over the period index returns were used when etfs in the portfolios were not in existence hypothetical fees were not applied to index returns to simulate etf net of fees performance and therefore the federal income tax savings would have been higher had actual simulated etf fees been applied in the hypothetical portfolios the simulation used total return data for purposes of estimating hypothetical historical federal income tax savings the portfolio weights associated with a hypothetical portfolio of moderate risk were assumed to be static throughout history in reality the portfolio allocation is likely to change over timethe taxloss harvesting example is based on a hypothetical moderate risk portfolio based using the following asset allocation and strategic benchmarks  us large company stocks  us small company stocks  int’l developed large company stocks  int’l developed small company stocks  int’l emerging market stocks

market bonds  gold and other precious metals and  cash investments tax savings can improve your returns over time because more of your assets stay invested returns on a  investment the chart above illustrates how tax loss harvesting could have affected your account value from  through  based on a hypothetical moderate risk portfolio the actual benefit of taxloss harvesting will vary from year to year and from investor to investor for example there may be fewer losses to harvest in years where markets are consistently rising and investor’s personal tax circumstances may mitigate or eliminate the benefit of tax loss harvesting and the future sale of replacement assets may result in higher capital gains than otherwise would be the case source charles schwab investment advisory click to view more detail this example is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only it is not intended to represent a specific investment product it is not tax advice and each investor is strongly encouraged to consult its own tax advisor about the utility of tax loss harvesting the example is based on a hypothetical k moderate risk portfolio held in a taxable account daily etf returns were used when available when not available returns were backfilled with the underlying index when the underlying index was unavailable then the strategic benchmark returns were used a  federal tax rate was assumed on ordinary income and shortterm capital gains and no allowance was made for state taxes tax loss harvesting opportunities were checked for all asset classes the losses being captured had to be greater than a set threshold before the trade was made at the end of every calendar year the tax savings were reinvested in the portfolio the tax savings are equal to the assumed tax rate multiplied by the amount of ordinary income offset by losses captured through the program the amount of ordinary income that may be offset by losses is limited to  or the amount of losses captured plus any tax loss carry forwards whichever is smaller the hypothetical example shown resulted in  of losses that could potentially carry forward to future calendar years there was no rebalancing assumed in the hypothetical portfolio the example assumes that there are no capital gains from any other portfolio the example does not consider the potential future sale of replacement assets which

funds mutual funds stocks there are two moments when checking on the value of your investments may be almost irresistible when your balance is soaring—and when it is tanking but that’s just when emotions have a nasty way of clouding the minds of even the most seasoned investors it is better to give your portfolio a regular checkup at the very least you should check your asset allocation once a year or any time your financial circumstances change significantly—for instance if you lose your job or get a big bonus your checkup is a good time to determine if you need to rebalance your asset mix or reconsider some of your specific investments we believe that setting and maintaining your strategic asset allocation are among the most important ingredients in your longterm investment success no matter what your age or goals we believe this means being diversified both among and within different types of stocks bonds and other investments why diversify the goal of diversification is not necessarily to boost performance—it won’t ensure gains or guarantee against losses but once you choose to target a level of risk based on your goals time horizon and tolerance for volatility diversification may provide the potential to improve returns for that level of risk to build a diversified portfolio you should look for assets—stocks bonds cash or others—whose returns haven’t historically moved in the same direction and to the same degree and ideally assets whose returns typically move in opposite directions this way even if a portion of your portfolio is declining the rest of your portfolio hopefully is growing thus you can potentially offset some of the impact of a poorly performing asset class on your overall portfolio another important aspect of building a welldiversified portfolio is that you try to stay diversified within each type of investment within your individual stock holdings beware of overconcentration in a single stock for example you may not want one stock to make up more than  of your stock portfolio fidelity also believes it’s smart to diversify across stocks by market capitalization small mid and large caps sectors and geography again not all caps sectors and regions have prospered at the same time or to the same degree so you may be able to reduce portfolio risk by spreading your assets across different parts of the stock market you may want to consider a mix of styles too such as growth and value similarly when it comes to your bond investments consider varying maturities credit qualities and durations which measure sensitivity to interestrate changes diversification has proven its longterm value during the – bear market many different types of investments lost value to some degree at the same time while it may have felt as though diversification failed during the downturn it didn’t the major asset classes were more highly correlated but diversification still helped contain portfolio losses consider the performance of three hypothetical portfolios a diversified portfolio of  stocks  bonds and  shortterm investments a  stock portfolio and an allcash portfolio diversification helped limit losses and capture gains during the  financial crisis source strategic advisers inc hypothetical value of assets held in untaxed accounts of  in an all cash portfolio a diversified growth portfolio of  us stocks  international stocks  bonds and  shortterm investments and all stockportfolio of  us stocks and  international stocks this chart’s hypothetical illustration uses historical monthly performance from january  through february  from morningstaribbotson associates stocks are represented by the sp  and msci eafe indexes bonds are represented by the barclays us intermediate government treasury bond index and shortterm investments are represented by us day tbills chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of any investment past performance is no guarantee of future results by the end of february  both the allstock and the diversified portfolios would have declined the allstock portfolio would have lost nearly half of its initial value – however the diversified portfolio would have lost a bit more than a third  yes the diversified portfolio would have declined but diversification would have helped reduce losses compared with the allstock portfolio the allcash portfolio  would have outperformed the allstock and diversified portfolios over this month period investors have averaged lower returns than some market indexes january  – december  source quantitative analysis of investor behavior qaib  dalbar inc wwwdalbarcom average equity fund investor and average bond fund investor performances were  from the dalbar study qaib  see the footnote dalbar study below for important information watching the value of a stock or diversified portfolio fall that much is just the kind of situation that can stir an investor’s emotions—and sometimes lead to shortterm decision making including dumping your stock holdings indeed keeping your money in cash might have seemed like a good idea in february  but look at what happened as market started to come back five years after the bottom our hypothetical allstock portfolio would have risen by  the diversified portfolio by  and the allcash portfolio by  the allstock portfolio got the biggest lift during the market’s upswing this is a good example of how such portfolios can behave when the market is in an upward trend—the diversified portfolio may gain less than the allstock portfolio and more than the allcash portfolio now let’s look at what happened over a longer cycle from january  through february  the diversified portfolio was up   while the allstock portfolio was up  this is what diversification is about it will not maximize gains in rising markets but it captured most of the gains while delivering less volatility than just investing in stocks the high price of bad timing why is it so important to have a risk level you can live with as the example above illustrates the value of a diversified portfolio usually plays out over time unfortunately many investors struggle to realize the benefits of their investment strategy because in buoyant markets people tend to chase performance and purchase higherrisk investments in a market downturn investors tend to flock to lowerrisk investment options which can lead to missed opportunities during ensuing market recoveries the degree of underperformance by individual investors has often been the worst during bear markets studies have consistently shown that the returns achieved by the average stock or bond fund investor have lagged often by a large margin the reported returns of the average stock or bond index the data from dalbar see chart right shows that fund investors trail the market significantly this means the decisions investors make about diversification within and across asset classes and trying to time when to get into or out of the market as well as about fees or underperforming funds cause them to generate far lower returns than the overall market “being disciplined as an investor isn’t always easy but over time it has demonstrated the ability to generate wealth while market timing has proven to be a costly exercise for many investors” observes an executive vice president at fidelity investments “having a plan that includes appropriate asset allocation and regular rebalancing can help investors overcome this challenge” building a diversified portfolio to start you need to make sure your asset mix eg stocks bonds and shortterm investments is aligned to your investment time frame financial needs and comfort with volatility the sample asset mixes below combine various amounts of stock bond and shortterm investments to illustrate different levels of risk and return potential choose the amount of stocks you are comfortable with data source morningstar inc  – past performance is no guarantee of future results returns include the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings this chart is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual or implied performance of any investment option see footnote two below for detailed information the purpose of the target asset mixes is to show how target asset mixes may be created with different risk and return characteristics to help meet a participants goals you should choose your own investments based on your particular objectives and situation remember you may change how your account is invested be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals diversification is not a onetime task once you have a target mix you need to keep it on track with periodic checkups and rebalancing if you don’t rebalance a good run in stocks could leave your portfolio with a risk level that is inconsistent with your goal and strategy how an investment mix can change over time this charts hypothetical illustration uses historical monthly performance from january  through december  from morningstaribbotson associates stocks are represented by the sp  and msci eafe indexes bonds are represented by barclays us intermediate government treasury bond index and shortterm investments are represented by us day tbills chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of any investment past performance is no guarantee of future results what if you don’t rebalance let’s look at a hypothetical portfolio over a historical year period to illustrate how changing markets such as last year’s large rise in the sp  can have an impact on an investment mix—and in turn on the amount of risk in a portfolio consider a hypothetical growth portfolio with  in stocks  us and  foreign  bonds and  shortterm investments in january  two decades later at the end of december  the investment mix has changed dramatically—to  in stocks  us and  foreign  in bonds and  short term see the chart right the resulting increased weight in stocks both domestic and foreign meant the portfolio now had more potential risk why because while past performance does not guarantee future results stocks have historically had larger price swings than bonds or cash this means that when a portfolio skews toward stocks the portfolio has the potential for bigger ups and downs in fact as the chart below shows the portfolio’s risk level as of december  was nearly  greater than that of the target mix due to changes in the asset allocation associated with the relative returns to stocks bonds and cash the standard deviation eg risk was  for the rebalanced portfolio and  for the buy and hold portfolio portfolio risk is measured by the annualized standard deviation of monthly returns which shows the variability of a portfolio’s returns let’s take a closer look at the risk levels of the hypothetical portfolio over time the chart below shows the hypothetical portfolio’s risk for two scenarios if the investment mix were rebalanced back to the target every year and if no rebalancing ever took place—in other words a buy and hold strategy as you can see the risk of the buyandhold portfolio varied more widely than that of the rebalanced portfolio on average during this time period the buyandhold portfolio experienced higher risk annualized portfolio volatility rebalancing is not just a riskreducing exercise the goal is to reset your asset mix to bring it back to the expected and appropriate risk level for you sometimes that means reducing risk by increasing the portion of a portfolio in more conservative options but sometimes it means adding more risk to get back to your target mix that could mean increasing investments in riskier asset classes such as stocks investing is an ongoing process you need to create a plan choose appropriate investments and then conduct regular checkups to keep your portfolio on track here are the three steps to do just that  know your target investment mix if you haven’t already done so choose a mix of stocks bonds and shortterm investments that you consider appropriate for your investing goals take into account your financial situation tolerance for volatility and when you will need the money you are investing not rebalancing led to more risk over time january december  chart is for illustrative purposes only the chart depicts observed historical risk based on the performance of broad diversified indexes named in the chart “how an investment mix can change over time” a portfolio that is not diversified within asset classes may experience different levels of risk stocks have historically had higher potential for growth and longer time periods can help to smooth out volatility on the other hand if you’ll need the money in just a few years—or if the thought of potentially losing money makes you too nervous—consider a higher allocation to generally less volatile investments such as bonds and shortterm investments by doing this of course you’d be trading the potential of higher returns for the potential of lower volatility  review your portfolio regularly we suggest you—on your own or in partnership with an investment professional—monitor your asset mix at least annually or whenever your financial circumstances change and rebalance your portfolio to correct for significant drift away from the mix you choose as a guideline you may want to consider rebalancing if your stock allocation moves away from your target by more than  percentage points  rebalancing when needed there are a variety of ways to rebalance your portfolio one is to sell those asset classes you currently have too much of and reinvest the proceeds in those that fall short of your target but selling securities in taxable accounts generally has tax consequences in the year of a sale so be sure to consider taxes when making any decisions to sell a way to rebalance without immediate tax consequences is to invest any new money you have savings contributions bonus etc either gradually or all at once in investments in asset classes that currently fall below your target regardless of which approach you take one important aspect of rebalancing is that you do it in a way that also keeps your portfolio diversified within each type of investment achieving your longterm goals requires balancing risk and reward choosing the right mix of investments and then periodically rebalancing and monitoring your choices can make a big difference in your outcome learn more get a holistic view of your retirement
