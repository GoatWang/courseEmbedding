new president and chief executive officer ceo contemplated the future growth opportunities of the company that he now controlled the ceo was taking the reins of rogers at a high point  it was a force to be reckoned with in all areas of the telecommunications sector including wireless television internet telephone and landline telephone however competition in the industry was also at an alltime high and innovations were abounding the ceo knew that in order to successfully develop rogers strategic direction for the future he would have to make a number of tradeoffs that would require a strong understanding of the competitive landscape and the future of the industry the case provides the following questions  can rogers afford to be a leader in all four product areas wireless television internet and landline telephone  should rogers maintain the industry trend toward offering quadruple plays  where should it be willing to lead and where should it be willing to lag behind competitors  should rogers think about its future as four or less distinct businesses or as one company  should rogers think about entering markets in which it does not currently have a strong presence  how do ancillary businesses such as media fit into rogers future  how much financial flexibility does rogers have for enacting any future strategies in making these tradeoffs rogers will have to explore its resource strengths and weaknesses this will allow it to gain an indepth understanding of its competitive advantage understanding its competitive advantage will help rogers make decisions concerning future resource investments that will allow it to lead the industry no matter which tradeoffs rogers considers making the results must help rogers continue to outperform its competitors by maintaining
