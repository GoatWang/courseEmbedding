the riskreward tradeoffs at play in their respective portfolios we believe that risk management is not only a responsibility of the firm but a critical component of our success investing in mlps involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock including risks related to cash flow dilution and voting rights each funds investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by mlps which may increase volatility energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities environmental hazards changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather mlps may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling mlps are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment including the risk that an mlp could lose its tax status as a partnership additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in mlp funds the oppenheimer steelpath mlp funds are subject to certain mlp tax risks an investment in an oppenheimer steelpath mlp fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an mlp with the exception of oppenheimer steelpath panoramic fund which is organized as a registered investment company the funds are organized as subchapter “c” corporations and are subject to us federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate currently as high as  as well as state and local income taxes the potential benefit of investing in mlps generally is their treatment as partnerships for federal income tax many mlps accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of mlp distributions considered to be a taxdeferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation on its investments this deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily nav and as a result a mlp funds aftertax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pretax performance is closely tracked to the extent that a fund obtains leverage through borrowings there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses investing in debt securities involves additional risks including interest rate risk credit risk duration risk and duplication of advisory fees and other expenses high yield securities involve more risks than investment grade securities and tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions private equity investments may be subject to greater risks than investments in publicly traded companies due to limited public information and lack of regulatory oversight × related resources tools 📊 historical prices access fund performance

the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

the rapid changes in the north american energy landscape “we are investing in companies that are best positioned to gain longterm advantage from these shifts and deliver relative performance across different commodity price scenarios” said brian watson cfa senior portfolio manager and director of research at oppenheimer steelpath “our longterm investment view allows us to benefit from expected dislocations in the evolving global energy market” oppenheimer steelpath’s investment process and understanding of the energy landscape honed over more than a decade of managing investments in the midstream energy sector are employed in the panoramic fund to provide investors with a more balanced portfolio of investments across the energy renaissance beneficiaries “the north american energy landscape has transformed creating a generational shift in relative competitive advantage as well as new opportunities across the entire energy value chain” said krishna memani chief investment officer at oppenheimerfunds “brian and his team are using their extensive knowledge of the energy sector to identify durable investment opportunities for our clients” the fund seeks to identify value by eschewing megacap exposure – such as international oil companies – and instead focusing on small and midcap companies with visible drivers and longterm advantages that will allow them to benefit the most from the us energy revolution though watson and the team believe the portfolio is likely to demonstrate greater volatility than oppenheimer steelpath’s current midstreamfocused portfolios they expect to find opportunities for greater returns oppenheimer steelpath has been a leader in energy investments since  and watson has two decades of energyfocused investment experience the group employs seven analysts dedicated to understanding the energy value chain and broader energy sector highlights the fund focuses on small and midcap companies with longterm advantages brian watson will
