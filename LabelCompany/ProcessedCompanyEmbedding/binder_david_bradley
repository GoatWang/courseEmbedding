of chainsaw is best for you there are several different types on the market including arborist mini pole and top handle chainsaws each comes with its own set of pros and cons and what works for one person might not work for someone else as with any power tool safety should be your number one concern so know your machine how it works how it stops and where to keep your hands at all timeswhats powering your chainsawlike most power tools pressure washers lawn edgers log splitters etc chainsaws have different options when it comes to how the machine is powered most people think that gas is the only way to go but others prefer to use one that runs on electricity for those that only do small jobs and do those jobs close to home or the garage a corded electric chainsaw will work or if the job is small but not around electricity a battery operated chainsaw gets the job donehow long is long enoughsize does matter on average you will find bar lengths that range from  inches to  inches in size for most people a bar length of  inches to  inches will cut easily through whatever needs to be cut down however professionals typically use one that is greater than  inches one thing to remember is a longer bar length means that there will be extra weight thus making it harder to use for extended periods of timebrand loyaltyusers often have a brand they love and prefer to buy only tools that come from that company thankfully brands like stihl craftsman husqvarna and echo continue to manufacture chainsaws that keep up with the demands of your workpick your featuresthere are many features available on different models not all models have the same features for example one model might include an antivibration feature which reduces fatigue and makes the saw more comfortable to use another model might include features such as a chain brake to stop the chain if a sudden movement or impact is felt by the saw and an automatic oiler that lubricates the chain as you cuttell us what you think

his effort to save the oncestoried national journal as “ years in the wilderness” marvin josephthe washington post david bradley made his fortune riding the great era of business consulting during the s and ’s he built two companies and reaped hundreds of millions as he sold them around the turn of the century “then i entered print magazines right as it went off a cliff” said the yearold chairman of atlantic media sitting on a recent friday afternoon in his eighthfloor office at watergate  the office building he recently sold that overlooks the potomac and kennedy center after enduring more than  million in losses over a decade bradley has secured the future of the atlantic the yearold monthly magazine that positions him at the commanding heights of the national conversation he expects to make back his investment in atlantic media when he finds a new owner for it in six to ten years “i want to find somebody who will love it as much as i’ve loved it” he said the recent sale of his watergate headquarters for  million to washington reit may have been part of a succession plan he and his wife katherine are also investors in axios the news company started by washington journalists mike allen and jim vandehei the bradleys recently set washington abuzz when they announced another atlantic media property — the businessoriented digital news site called quartz — was profitable the announcement spurred rumors about a sale “there are no plans to sell quartz” an atlantic media spokesman said “atlantic media is proud of quartz’s achievement of profitability anything beyond that such as the reported speculation about quartz’s future is pure speculation” but if anything illustrates david bradley’s steely calculus for running a business it’s the national journal he calls folding the oncestoried trade magazine on national politics “the biggest business failure of my life” his “ years in the wilderness” trying to break a path to assure its survival was emblematic of the media crisis of his day for decades the magazine had a solid business and loyal following selling inside information to lobbyists legislators and journalists the internet changed all that wellfunded entries moved in including politico and its politico pro bloomberg government cq roll call huffington post realclear politics and even google whose google alerts decimated national journal’s hotline political tip sheet the rivals turned the lucrative insidethebeltway media market into a commoditized freeforall national journal subscribers no longer wanted to pay to get something that they could read online for free the first issue of the national journal from  atlantic media to its credit national journal did what startups do all the time try and fail try and fail try and fail “one theory was we would get into the breakingnews business — a real fool’s errand” bradley said “the second theory was that we would make the national journal a national property the way we made the atlantic a national property a third theory was that we would succeed by having a very expensive paywall we would be a digital media company but with a multithousanddollar paywall nobody comes across a paywall your mother won’t go across a paywall” bradley finally saw a way forward which was solving problems for the same client base but with new customized products such as charts slides and informational analysis that help navigate washington’s power centers he chose survival that meant closing the flagship weekly print magazine deemphasizing national journal’s journalism giving up its public service mission and disappointing the faithful washington insiders including journalists who followed the publication over decades “it used to be a unique washington institution with a public mission” said brian kelly the us news  world report editor who has successfully navigated the news magazine into a digital enterprise known primarily for its rankings of hospitals cars and colleges “if you were researching f sales to saudi arabia you looked it up in national journal now it’s just another business” huge changes at national journal the final issue of the national journal from december  atlantic media national journal  the resurrection of national journal  into a profitable business with virtually no resemblance to its print version mirrors the existential challenges many oldmedia companies including this newspaper have faced over the past two decades as their bedrock advertising revenue evaporated bradley and national journal president kevin turpin ii have reinvented the company into an unglamorous assortment that resembles something out of mckinsey  company’s consulting playbook turpin whom bradley refers to as “my fourth son” is a potential heir apparent to the sprawling atlantic media which includes the atlantic the quartz online news site live event organizers video and studios that create advertising over the past  years during countless dinners lunches breakfasts and office meetings bradley has become turpin’s mentor and is comfortable with his style and poise instead of overseeing a repertoire of mustread bylines turpin  is selling insider information wrapped in wonky names such as presentation center policy brands roundtable and network science initiative which is headed by a former counterterrorism expert who worked on the obama administration’s national security council some journalism remains in the hotline and national journal daily reports but nearly threequarters of its  employees work on things that did not exist in  building road maps to washington power players analyzing potential effects of executive orders and legislation and providing companies with inside dope on what washington influencers think of them new services are planned that include “house calls” on clients and a damagecontrol toolkit for companies under socialmedia attack both businesses are in response to clients who want more handholding on strategy and the risks of social media “it’s sort of deep research on the ways of washington” bradley said it’s expensive stuff even by paytoplay washington standards policy brands roundtable runs  a year network science initiative  to  the leadership council which includes the presentation center the national journal print daily hotline and a research arm averages about  depending on the size of the client “what national journal does is no longer journalism it’s data analytics” said ed newberry managing global partner for squire patton boggs one of the biggest law firms on the planet “it’s the ability to gather and process data for our clients” bradley and turpin have unapologetically turned the institution into a modern imitation of the advisory board and the corporate executive board the subscriptionbased business intelligence companies that made bradley immensely wealthy two decades ago the irony thickens when you consider the original name of the national journal when it was started in  as government research corp distributed as a stack of papers with holes punched for a threering binder ‘a very natural leader’ david bradley right and kevin turpin the president of national journal who has steered the brand back to a business intelligence outfit for washington insiders marvin josephthe washington post the national journal’s business model echoes the advisory board and corporate executive board in other ways hire smart somethings work them hard pay them  a year until they leave for law school business school or something else repeat a few who stand out get promoted kevin turpin ii stood out the georgetown university graduate and preacher’s son blew through his sales goals within two months of joining the company in  after answering a posting on monstercom he had a knack for persuading corporate or association executives to make the heavy lift and purchase national journal’s  annual magazine subscription and the  hotline promotions followed over the next three years after a juicy offer from a rival publication hit turpin’s desk in early  bradley invited his star salesman to breakfast at the owner’s favorite corner table at the four seasons hotel “this is the first time david and i really sat down oneonone” turpin said turpin arrived early for breakfast wearing an illfitting suit he had bought at a discount store in virginia beach bradley who said his own unique strength is spotting talent spoke for almost  minutes while his nervous employee attacked a plate of pancakes “david starts talking to me about my career” he said “thinking back he was interviewing me to see if he wanted to keep me” an email arrived in turpin’s inbox the next day which was followed by a personal letter bradley wanted to map out a future for turpin at national journal he wanted to map out a future for national journal itself “i really think my gift is seeing gifts in other people” bradley said he sees many gifts in turpin “he is quite different he is a very natural leader” bradley an inveterate letterwriter said in the followup letter that he wanted turpin to partner with him in a product that would lead to the evolution of national journal together they would build businesses essential to washington’s decision makers “he wanted me to go out and do the market research to help prepare the way” turpin said bradley asked turpin to start a person sounding board comprised of associations nonprofit organizations and clients of the national journal they spent the next year listening “i met with everyone from mastercard and microsoft to the environmental defense fund national wildlife federation squire patton boggs procter  gamble i went out and made  pitches” turpin said “i would ask them about challenges what kept them awake at night” on the plate for atlantic editorinchief jeffrey goldberg what to do about news some lobbyists said they were spending too much time building powerpoints writing memos and briefing colleagues at the home office that led in february  to the rollout of presentation center which built powerpoint slides on politics congress and legislation for lobbyists and others to use in their briefings presentation center would anchor the new national journal others said they needed to know what washington thought of their company or their issue were there any minefields what was around the corner who were their friends that led to policy brands roundtable which launched in august  and soon infused  million in revenue at a  percent profit margin it informed clients what washington decisionmakers thought of them and offered ways to shape that thinking think of it as reputational management by  pesky rivals such as politico and its politico pro the bradleyesque data provider that mined “verticals” from cybersecurity to ehealth were consuming more and more of the magazine’s customer base the financial crisis and ensuing recession — and the lack of legislation during the obama years — shrunk insidethebeltway advertising demand further “the cookie was getting smaller” turpin said “so we created another cookie” bradley and turpin teamed up on yet another product called network science initiative bradley had spotted a new field in academia called network science pioneered by yale university’s nicholas a christakis essentially it is figuring out who the most influential people are whether it’s tracking obamacare influencers on social media or terrorists on cellphones in afghanistan the us military uses network science to track the cellphone calls numbers and voices to create a matrix that tells them who does what in the taliban “i just came and said ‘i wonder if washington works in networks’ ” bradley said after trial and error he and turpin devised a new business that is one of their stars the yearold network science has grown its staff from four to  it has more than  clients and expects to turn a profit this year by  national journal’s ad business was wheezing and profitability depended on how the numbers were counted “the national journal had atrophied” said john fox sullivan a shrewd media executive and longtime president of national journal who retired from daytoday operations at the publication and left to become mayor of rural washington va in  “you were throwing all your weight into the world of politics where you had a gazillion competitors who were better and bigger and weren’t charging a lot of money the company had changed so much i said to david ‘what is the point in publishing the magazine anymore the strategy
