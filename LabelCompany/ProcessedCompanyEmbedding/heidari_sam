sam sam sam heidari thank you vern good afternoon everyone thanks for joining us today q of  marked another excellent quarter for quantenna please note that this was our first full quarter as a publicly held company today we have a lot of good news to share with you and i appreciate your interest and support in quantenna let us start by briefly reviewing our q financial highlights im pleased to report that quantenna produced record revenues delivering  million for the first quarter this represents an impressive  growth over the first quarter of  and to add we have a strong balance sheet with  million in cash regarding quantennas product mix our ac wave  performed well and we expect incremental growth in q that will exceed its record q level further our n product saw continued strength in q that was driven by increased market share finally our g wave  revenue continued to grow as we have seen increasing interest from our customers and we expect this momentum to continue through the rest of the year during the first quarter we had three announcements across our ecosystem that reinforced our position as the leading provider of the highest performing wifi technology on the planet first we announced the qsrgax this is a followon product to industrys first ax introduction or stream qsrgax the qsrg leverages quantenna proprietary architecture and is ready to take advantage of our customer pipeline and established footprint of ac solutions we expect this product to position us well for success in the mainstream wifi market we expect our gax and our gax will be critical new products for the next generation of wifi convergence to the next standards will take time to unfold as has been the case historically but we anticipate to be the first to the market and ready to lead our customers to a better wifi experience second we introduced a carriergrade fullduplex wifi range extender with greenwave systems and finally we introduced soniq or self optimizing network software that unites various network devices coupled with our semiconductor solution for residential gateways repeaters and video clients soniq can transform the home wifi experience via an intelligently managed network it will detect and route the best connection for any of your client devices in addition im also excited to report that in the first quarter we sold past the shipment of our  millionth wifi chip this is a major milestone that represents over a decade of intense development efforts led by our worldclass team this milestone demonstrates a scalable operational efficiency as you may recall what makes our wifi technology unique on the last call we discussed what makes our wifi technology unique on the last call this is demonstrated on slide  of the earnings presentation now i would like to take an opportunity to share with the investors the market growth forecast for premium wifi solution if you refer to slide  we have a chart that shows our market opportunity abi research forecasts that the nonportable wifi enabled devices that have x mimo technology or greater which we define as premium will grow from  million in  to  billion in  that is a  compound annual growth rate even though we dont separately break this out the x mimo market is expected to have a more impressive growth rate of  compound annual growth from  through  please note that we are still the only x solution currently offered now i would like to turn the call over to sean sean sobers thanks sam and good afternoon everyone as vern previously stated our financial commentary should be referenced in conjunction with both my remarks and the earnings press release issued today we are pleased to report record revenue of  million in the first quarter this represents  growth over the first quarter last year and is up  sequentially from the fourth quarter of  the sequential growth was particularly strong given the typical seasonal industry softness experienced in q also let me remind you that q  was an extended week quarter and q  we are back to our normal week quarter taking this into account and adjusting for the extra week the sequential growth over q would have been  our first quarter gross margin was in line with our expectations at  and declined  basis points sequentially but gained  basis points yearoveryear as we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call our gross margin is typically impacted by mix our operating expenses were in line with our expectations reflecting increased staffing levels and costs associated with being a public company that were recognized in sales and marketing and ga rd expenses declined sequentially due to the timing of development projects we used  in cash from operations in the first quarter or  per share due to expanding our working capital as the business continues to grow our nongaap eps which excludes stockbased compensation was  for the first quarter compared to  for the fourth quarter of  and a loss of  in the first quarter of  turning to our balance sheet we closed q  with  million in cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable ended at  million or  days sales outstanding this compares to  million or  days in q  this increase was primarily due to the timing of customer payments inventory ended at  million or  annualized turns in the first quarter compared to  million or  annualized turns in the fourth quarter this decline was due to heavier shipments of our legacy products coupled with an inventory decline due to improving operational efficiencies now for a discussion of revenue segmentation by wifi technology as we anticipated our ac wave  product declined  sequentially in q due to typical seasonal softness from our customers as well as one less week in the first quarter relative to the fourth wave  products doubled over the first quarter of  growing  yearoveryear due to continued strong customer interest we anticipate wave  revenue to grow sequentially in q and exceed our q levels our legacy n revenue grew  sequentially in the first quarter on relatively smaller revenue levels as a result of increased market share n products declined  yearoveryear in the first quarter in line with our overall expectations that this product area will decline over time our wave  g product grew from  of revenue in the fourth quarter to  in the first quarter or  million while still relatively small to our overall revenue we expect wave  revenue to grow sequentially in q and continue to grow throughout the second half of  as service providers ramp design wins into volume production i will now cover our guidance for the second quarter of  as the second quarter progresses we have seen continued demand from our customers for our ac wave  products coupled with the ramp of our g products taking this into consideration we expect second quarter revenue to be between  million and  million we expect our product mix to improve in the second quarter accordingly we anticipate our nongaap gross margin for the second quarter to be between  and  however as we have stated in our prior call we anticipate the gross margin on our g product will be below the corporate average until we complete cost optimization efforts toward the end of  thus gross margin performance may fluctuate in the second half of  in q we plan to invest in rd and add incremental headcount as well as incur increased expenses related to development projects note that our rd expenses will generally fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of these projects also we anticipate sales and marketing and ga to grow modestly thus we expect second quarter operating expenses to grow  to  sequentially with rd accounting for most of this increase in the second quarter we expect tax expenses to be in the range of  to  so to summarize for the second quarter we anticipate a gaap loss of  to  per share and the nongaap eps to be between  and  please refer to our gaap to nongaap business outlook reconciliation contained in our earnings release for more information we are excited about our revenue growth as the demand for our products continues finally i would also like to note that while we understand there is interest related to our large service provider customers we do not plan to share specifics about our customer relationships therefore we will not be discussing or updating specific design wins or details with investors on a regular basis we appreciate your understanding i would like to now turn the call over to sam for concluding remarks sam heidari thank you sean as i discussed earlier on the call we continue to work diligently to bring the best wifi experience with service providers strategically we are finding our efforts are much more readily monetized in this area relative to retail and enterprise of course we are still working closely with key partners in both retail and enterprise market we continue to partner with our service provider customers as they broaden their presence in the residential market they are absorbing a very dynamic market here such as traditional cable operators that are quadbundling mobile phone services and satellite operators being bought by mobile carriers for us this presents a significant opportunity the key to this augmentation often therefore is a very reliable and highperformance wifi fabric because of our positioning the market is rapidly moving toward us for example if you were to look at one of our key target markets the residential hotspots the growth is exceptional according to cisco total wifi residential hotspots will grow from  million in  to  million in  this represents a  compound annual growth over the fiveyear period quantenna is not just participating in this growth we are enabling it if you think we are crazy about wifi you are right but you are not alone in a recent study conducted by comcast xfinity  of multiunit residential managers ranked wifi as an amenity thats most important to their renters this compared to just  who identified inroom laundry facilities wifi could soon be considered a utility just like electricity and running water so in summary we are very proud of our heritage of enabling the bestinclass wifi solution that improves everyones life we just posted a backtoback record revenue in the quarter and announced a strong outlook for q we have a portfolio of leadingedge products that are capturing the market needs of today and tomorrow we couldnt be more excited about our future and finally we have a great team that brings their agame to work every day i couldnt be more proud of that now this concludes our prepared remarks we would like to open the call for your questions stephanie questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from suji desilva with roth capital suji desilva congratulations on the strong results here as a gate and also congratulations on making  million units i wanted to ask about the unit number here its about  million two quarters ago it was about  million that metric helps us kind of understand your unit shipments can you talk about how we should think about blended asp along with that in the trend any puts and takes we should think about as you roll out the newer products and multiple products sean sobers i think as we discussed in the past asps are climbing as we migrate towards g thats for two reasons one overall the higher end and higher performance but youre also getting more real estate from the overall chipset so we are having both  ghz and  ghz before our products were only  ghz so if you think about asp as you migrate to g you are seeing around doubling of that if not more suji desilva okay good and then in terms of the competitive landscape can you give us a sense versus three months ago and your thoughts there competitors certainly are trying to catch up to you and then what youre seeing in the design competitions that you have encountered more recently sam heidari so as far as we are concerned today i mean easily we are still the only x product out there offering in the designs we have not seen any evidence of any other product having been in our customers hand so we are leading that meanwhile we are continuing to ship and win even new design wins with our legacy x solution suji desilva very good and then last quick question you talked about carriergrade extender sam is that a meaningful incremental market opportunity for you guys and would that show up in whatever interface and protocol its handling or would it be a separate line item help us understand if thats something we should be paying attention to as an incremental opportunity sam heidari so the entry to the market i dont think that is going to be identified as a separate line item for the time being i dont think it will have – and it is definitely a – the significance of that and importance of that is it provides a complete solution to the service providers and their end customers as a onestop shop but it is going to be maybe more meaningful in the years to come i dont see it in  suji desilva okay fair enough thanks guys congrats again operator your next question comes from quinn bolton with needham  company quinn bolton i want to echo my congratulations on the strong results and guidance sean just wanted to come through the guidance for the second quarter you said that wave  would be back to or above record levels from the fourth quarter so it sounds like wave  solution should be about  million or better i think you said n would decline and that was around  million so it kind of sounds like the core business is probably somewhere around  million if thats right it sounds like the wave  or g solution could be anywhere from about  million to  million in the second quarter and i just want to make sure that thats kind of the right expectation you are setting or do you think that the wave  ac stuff sees some significant growth above the previous q  record level sean sobers its a very good question and you do know how to do math very well but were not going to be more specific than what we said earlier we are expecting over time obviously on the wave  g product to continue to grow and grow significantly but i cant give you any more specifics sam heidari we did say that wave  will be higher than q sean sobers yes exactly quinn bolton okay and then i guess just with your mixing towards the g solutions yet your gross margin sort of uptick in the second quarter despite that mix towards the g solution can you tell us whats going on in wave  product line thats standing for the better mix shift or is the g solutions coming a little bit better than perhaps previously expected sean sobers so i mean we talk a lot about kind of the three pieces n and then wave  ac and then wave  or g ac when we talk about it on that level inside that level there is a multiple chipset that could make up different product sets that have different profiles so when the product mix is in there and it comes in differently it can have a different impact on the overall outcome but theres nothing – were still working towards cost optimization on the g product as we progress through the end of  quinn bolton okay and then just one more for sam and then ill hop back in the queue just sam what are you seeing in terms of demand for the x mimo youre still the only provider with x on the market are service providers kind of waiting for kind of first design wins for x to ramp before making their decisions or are you already layering in additional x design wins on top of your initial qsrg ramp sam heidari quinn if i may go back to the conversations we have had at the time of ipo even as earlier as a couple of months ago i stated how many different service providers are there in deployment and the new ones which are coming on which we kind of showed that landscape to you before we talked about  at the time being deploying service providers and we have about  overall design wins in deployment so a good number of them are coming up a good number of the ones which are coming up are x design wins so x is getting good traction in the market today and we expect multiples of this going to deployment this year and then follow up to be by the following year quinn bolton great thanks for the additional color operator your next question comes from blayne curtis with barclays blayne curtis ill echo my congrats as well sean just wanted to go back on the prior question i know you dont want to breakout specific numbers but it sounded like with the opex line going up im assuming thats a tapeout so maybe if you could just talk about the timing of wave  is it progressing as you expected and have talked about prior and then if you are taping out the cost down is that also going to – can you talk about the timing of that and the impact to the gross margin sean sobers so you are right in a sense that the developments that are happening in rd when we talk about projects those are generally tapeouts were not going to talk about specifically which one but we are tracking in what we believe we forecasted for the full year as it relates to g and when the costdown is going to come as well as when the revenue ramp is going to come so no real changes there from anything we talked about or thought about in the past blayne curtis okay and maybe you could just talk about the strength youre expecting in june in wave  coming back where are you seeing that strength from sean sobers i think generally its across our customer base we have quite a few service providers that are in rollout and ramping up across their customer base so we can have a view to whats going to happen in q obviously were halfway through q as we speak right now so we have a good visibility towards whats going to happen in the quarter blayne curtis perfect and then just the opex guidance for june just want to make sure i understand the moving pieces obviously youre a small company and tapeouts can matter so march was depressed it was lower than expected now june is with  million how do you think about that opex line in the back half of the year sean sobers and i think you are right on the impacts of the tapeouts are going to be the things that fluctuate mostly obviously were a company thats growing pretty rapidly above  so hiring is going to be a big portion of that as well so those are the big drivers the focus areas for expense growth is going to come out of rd its not going to be for the most part sales and marketing and ga but as tapeouts happen and hiring comes thats where the driver is going to be operator your next question comes from joe moore with morgan stanley joe moore with regards to the g product it seems like its a differentiated product for the retail market as well and it seems like there would be demand for that can you talk about any potential milestones we may see in terms of their ability to just start ramping more of a presence in the retail router market sam heidari as we have mentioned earlier retail is an opportunistic market for us we definitely have our eyes on it we have been engaged with a toptier retail oem and we execute towards having a presence there it is going to be – in a shorter term i think its not going to be a significant portion of our revenue and in the longer term it will be meaningful but not significant portion of our revenue our focus today i think that is service provider market is growing very rapidly and we are going to leverage from there what we have into the retail market when there is an opportunity joe moore okay great and then in the service provider market there were a bunch of supply disruptions earlier in the year around one of their customers struggled to get dram and another one was struggling to get chipsets and obviously youve grown nicely through that but have you seen any impact of that supplychain disruption and is there any effect on your either q or q numbers sean sobers this is sean no we havent actually seen any impact of that i mean we were obviously getting similar questions as we were going through closing our q and such but we havent seen any impact to us on that case joe moore great thank you and congratulations operator your next question comes from anil doradla with william blair anil doradla sam and team congrats from my end too so sam when you deal with the service providers today and there are discussions that you have with them the choices are between different mimo streams between wave  and wave  can you share some insights into kind of the types of discussions or some of the criteria that is pushing these service providers in configuring their mimo streams versus wave  and wave  right now sam heidari so the problem statement has been the same and it is i think what you hear from the service provider is very clear the wifi connectivity is frequently linked usually in the full network and the devices performance and the bandwidth into the home is judged based on an endtoend measurement of the throughput so when they select a technology its not just about x versus x which i think x contributes significantly toward the right direction and better performance of the system its about guaranteeing the whole home coverage futureproofing it for the services reducing the service cost and being able to advertise the differentiation of their network compared to someone else and these are the fundamental needs which have been indicated for the past few years that weve been in the business and weve foreseen it to be the reason for going forward and it includes all those things that i mentioned that is it differentiates us and is needed for service providers anil doradla what i was hoping sam is that is it like a tipping point like when you talk about x is it  gigabit per second that people the service providers are pushing at x or is there some bandwidth requirements where a certain mimo constellation is made in sam heidari right so i think that  gigabit per second for example or you take any number  megabits per second for entire home coverage its still going to get a benefit from x because x is going to take that curve further out in your home coverage at the same time within the home communication going from one device to another doing a backup and your home networking channel within the home is going to take a benefit of the higher throughput that x analysis has to offer at the same time the wifi is a shared medium you share the frequency with your neighbors so the faster you can communicate the more air time you can free up in order to help your neighbors or not to get hurt by your neighbors by being able to transmit your packet and open a slot over the air all of these are the reasons that x gets selected today anil doradla okay and finally when do you think competition will come in with x solutions you said you are the only guys there today thanks a lot sam heidari right so i mean last earnings call we had a conversation about that based on the news release we have not seen anything otherwise since then and i might add we have had this product for a couple of years it does take time to mature it so we think that there is a level of lead time for us here still because of our maturity of the product as coming together anil doradla congrats guys operator your next question comes from ross seymore with regiment ross seymore just wanted to look first in the quarter you got substance ph of your guidance nicely what was the cause of that sean sobers so a big driver perhaps in general on growth is going to be service providers introducing new products and rolling out them across their customer base so i think thats kind of general but we do see the growth is going to be coming from wave  ac as well as g as we migrate towards the back half of the year obviously both of those are somewhat of a driver as it relates to qs activity as well ross seymore so a similar question the n market share gains little surprised that that performed so well i know you said earlier that it will go down over time but what led to the market share gains there in what i would assume to be a more competitive market sean sobers on the n side its actually a smaller group of customers there and we have one customer in particular go and convert kind of an older sku that wasnt quantenna into a quantenna sku so now they are only selling quantenna wifi so that was able for us to capture market share that way it did have somewhat of a meaningful impact i guess when you look at what n has done historically recent and near quarters too what was able to be done in q but we think over time as with all the standard products they migrate on to the next generation from n to ac and then ac to ax ross seymore then the last question one for sam and you touched on this a little bit earlier about the g product but i just wondered if in lieu of talking about one specific customer or any specific customer which i know youre not going to do can you talk a little bit about the breadth of adoption of the x solutions and is there any way for us to judge by the number of service providers that are adopting that to get a good idea of what the revenue trajectory of the company may be going forward and also as a sign of the competitive intensity and your ability to stay ahead of those competitors sam heidari right so we do have a definite lead against the competitors today and these design wins that we have mentioned earlier with the service providers are very sticky and for the longterm so the ones that you establish and go to deployment you get to deploy them for a while so now if you want to quantify that the numbers of the design wins that we are talking about right now are intense so there are a meaningful number of the design wins that are going to convert to x as a function of time so i mean thats all i can tell you about but it is not a novelty number of designs ross seymore great congrats guys thanks operator there are no further questions i will now turn it back over to sam sam heidari thank you on the behalf of quantenna worldwide team i would like to thank you for your interest and continued support operator this concludes the call operator thank you this does conclude

as the th annual roth conference in orange county on march th now i’ll turn the call over to sam sam dr sam heidari thank you vern good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today  was an excellent year for quantenna and i’m excited to share with you our accomplishments today we have a lot of good news to share and i appreciate your interest and support in quantenna let us start by briefly reviewing our q and  financial highlights i’m pleased to report that quantenna produced a strong revenue growth delivering  million for the fourth quarter and  million for the year this represents a growth of  over the fourth quarter of  and  over the full year  we have a very strong balance sheet with  million in cash and generated positive cash from the operations in both fourth quarter and the full year  during the fourth quarter we had several milestones that reinforce our position as a leading provider of the highest performance wifi technology on the planet i’m excited to report that in the fourth quarter we started shipping production quantities of our qsrg products this product was first announced in september  qsrg’s unmatched performance takes wifi technology to a whole new level addressing additional markets and applications qsrg offers the fastest wifi speed available on the market today we’re now going to start offering investors quality update on our g wave  revenue in addition to the revenue from our core growth in ac wave  and legacy  offerings please refer to our financial commentary and information which sean will discuss later today also during the fourth quarter we announced the industry’s first ax wifi chipset built on and is pin compatible to our qsrg wave  platform we believe we have a time to market advantage and we are wellpositioned to address users high density needs when the ax standard starts rolling out to customers and lastly something which i think most of you are aware of we successfully priced our ipo and raised approximately  million in net proceeds not only being a public company made us more attractive to hire top engineering talent it has also boosted our profile with our customers and supply chain and under ipo i would just like to take a moment to thank all the employees who have created the most innovative a stateoftheart product it really does take a strong team to push the envelope on what is possible and i couldn’t be more proud of our employees i would also like to thank our customers every single one of them particularly the especial thanks goes to the ones who supported us in our early growth phase now i would like to address the questions that we have heard from some investors for our news or story what makes quantenna differentiated from other wifi chipset vendors isn’t the wifi technology built on welldefined standards well while it’s true that our products are based on the ieee ax standard the opportunity for differentiation is broad implementation of the mandatory standard features matter above that there are optional and proprietary features that are implemented uniquely by chipset vendors using the automobile analogy to our mandatory set of features for cars such as engine tires and steering wheel but not all cars are created equal the technique and the knowhow in the implementation of these mandatory features significantly matters these basic features embody essentially what the ieee specs outline for minimum wifi functionality while vendors’ implementation makes all the difference furthermore to add ieee spec also outlines optional features such as mimo order higher channel bandwidth and beamforming it is up to the chipset vendor to implement or not these optional features the chipset vendors based on their cost performance and scheduled trade off may or may not decide to implement these features quantenna has always taken a pioneering approach in implementation of these standard optional features we have been the first with beamforming first with x mimo first with multiuser mimo first x with the highest bandwidth utilization and there are many other examples as such additionally we laid on top of this our proprietary features that truly separates us from our competitors these include but are not limited to our unique algorithm for the utilization of radar bands or network analytic platform or network optimization software and more much like we are entering a new era of traveling by automobile where navigation and diagnosis are driven by sophisticated algorithm or wifi solutions are algorithmic intensive and enable another domination of intelligence and performance this unique layer that we have created on top of their standard has enabled us to win top tier account addressing challenging needs such as a whole home coverage on wireless linear video distribution in the latter we succeeded against the only competition at the time which was a wired connection as many of you know we are partnering with the leading service providers in their mission to deliver the best connectivity experience to the end users so the major change occurring in the web service provider are approaching their business model traditionally it has been a risk to bring the largest broadband pipes to your doorsteps today however we are inside your home building a stateoftheart highperformance network that is ready for the future they want to own these signal path endtoend not only to solve the current home connectivity challenge but also offer a wide range of services that are only beginning to emerge we plan to be the strategic partner for this highest performance and most reliable wifi technology today and for the future now i would like to turn the call over to quantenna’s chief financial officer sean sobers sean sean sobers thanks sam good afternoon everyone as vern previously stated our financial commentary should be referenced in conjunction with both my remarks and the earnings press release issued today we are pleased to report record fourth quarter revenue of  million and record annual revenue of  million this represents  growth over the fourth quarter last year and  growth over full year  our fourth quarter gross margin was a record  gross margin improved due to a combination of factors but primarily due to favorable customer mix we also generated  in positive cash from operations in the fourth quarter and generated  million for the full year  our nongaap eps which excludes stockbased compensation was  for the fourth quarter and  for  turning to our balance sheet we closed  with  million in cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable ended at  million or  days sales outstanding this compares to  million or  days in the third quarter the improvement was primarily due to favorable timing of customer payments inventory ended at  million or  annualized turns in the fourth quarter compared to  million or  annualized turns in the third quarter this increase was due to an increased purchases of inventory in anticipation of future product sales in subsequent quarters for the first quarter we expect inventory to remain flat or mostly decline  or moderately decline as we continue to ramp products into our channels to support customer demand we are pleased to share with the investment community our revenue segmentation by wifi technology which should help investors better understand the adoption curve and lifecycle of our technology innovations our ac wave  products increased from  of revenue in the third quarter to  in the fourth quarter our legacy n revenue decreased from  of revenue in the third quarter to  in the fourth quarter and as sam mentioned earlier we experienced our first production shipments of our ac wave  g product which at  of revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to grow materially off this relatively small base throughout  i will now cover our guidance for the first quarter of  for background please note that quantenna just completed a week period in the fourth quarter in our current we shift to a regular week period as the first quarter progresses we have seen continued demand from our customers in our n and ac wave  products coupled with the ramp in our g products as a result and prior years have indicated historically q revenue is seasonally lower than q revenue additionally we are operating with one last week sequentially taking all this into account we expect first quarter revenue to between  million to  million our product mix in the first quarter is not anticipated to be as favorable as we experienced in the fourth quarter although less meaningful as we’ve discussed previously with investors we anticipate the gross margin on our g product will be below the corporate average until we complete cost optimization efforts toward the end of  accordingly we anticipate our gaap gross margin for the first quarter to be between  and  we continue to invest in sales and rd however we’ll have one less week in the first quarter relative to the fourth thus we expect first quarter operating expenses to decline between  to  sequentially as we shift to a standard week first quarter in the first quarter we expect upfront tax expenses related to establishing our new corporate structure as a public company as a result we’re expecting additional tax expenses in the range of  to  in the first quarter plus what we believe will be our normal tax rate of  to  to summarize for the first quarter we anticipate a gaap loss of  per share to a  per share loss and for nongaap earnings per share to be between breakeven and  please refer to our gaap to nongaap business outlook reconciliations contained in our earnings release for more information i would also like to note that while we understand there’s interest related to our larger service provider customers we do not plan to share specifics about our customer relationships therefore we’ll not be discussing or updating specific design win details with investors on a regular basis we appreciate your understanding i’d like to now turn the call over to sam for concluding remarks sam dr sam heidari thank you sean as i discussed earlier on the call we continue to work diligently to bring the best wifi experience to our customers in the service providers’ space on top of that opportunity we’re also working with key partners in the retail space for high performance wifi solutions furthermore in the softwareintensive enterprise space we’re focused on our customer engagement one final thing i’d like to discuss the market opportunity for our products abi research forecast that nonportable wifi enabled devices will grow at a compound annual growth of  from  through  diving in to that data a layer deeper the x mimo market is expected to have a  cagr from  through  and x mimo market is expected to have an  cagr from  through  we’re effectively the only wifi  the only x solution currently offered in the market so in the summary we’re very proud of our heritage of bringing the bestinclass wifi solutions to the market to better everyone’s life we’re wifi perfector this concludes our prepared remarks we’d now like to open the call up to your questions maria questionandanswer session operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of joe moore of morgan stanley joe moore you talked a little bit about the g ramp you still have the same assumption that the cost down products sort of improves the gross margins in the fourth quarter any new updates there and then how quickly do you see adoption if you can talk about your new customers from existing customers how quickly do you see g rolling into production thank you sean sobers this is sean we expect the g product ramp to be kind of as we talked about it in the past to be a really second half event our customers generally take a while for rollout so it will happen in the back half of  from a gross margin perspective we are continuing to do cost optimization which will start to impact the financial statements in the back half of  as well joe moore and i noticed that one of your competitors today press released their ax solution pump i know you guys are sampling early this year i don’t know if you can sample that yet if you can give an update there and then is that product that can go into production you see volume more   just an update on your latest thoughts on ax thank you dr sam heidari yes traditionally all competitors have followed us as a function of time we did notice the announcement today and we think that this  what they have announced and their performance matches our g product that we announced earlier we still believe that we have the highest performance available in the market and the fact that we are ahead of them in the market with the product maturity operator our next question comes from line of ross seymore of deutsche bank ross seymore on the revenue side in the quarter and the guide were both couple million stronger than i had expected can you talk a little bit about  was that just conservatism in our prior discussions or was something actually better than you had expected and if so what was it sean sobers our overall philosophy is to be able to print the numbers not guide them so we want to see that it’s there so you can maybe say there’s a little bit conservatism in there but we also did feel we had a strong quarter and we are very comfortable with our outlook ross seymore and as i look at the opex side of the equation sean i know you had  weeks so that messed up the comparisons a little bit but if i think about opex going forward from the mid level that you are applying  million that is how should we think about that growing as we go through the rest of the year sean sober we are going to continue to invest in the business specifically in rd on the technical sales as well so you are going to see us grow over time obviously it’s going to grow less than we expect revenue to grow so that’s where we have  or expect to have margin expansion so it’s similar to things that we discussed in the past ross seymore then i guess the last question on my side on the gross margin side of the equation joe asked a little bit about the trajectory when the g product really ramps but generally speaking as we think about the mix that you are now segmenting by those different products is it almost always going to be that it’s the new products initially ramp up that pulls the gross margin down for a period of time or is this specific to the g product launch sean sobers no i think that’s a reasonable assumption we are generally opting ph the leading edge trying to make the best things and get into our customers’ hands as fast as possible then the evolution of the products and the cost of the products go through the cost optimization over time so that’s when you start to see margin expansion operator our next question comes from the line of blayne curtis with barclays blayne curtis maybe a followup couple of on the gross margin sean maybe if you could just talk about you said mix throughout the trend in december if you could just maybe elaborate on what the puts and takes there and i think when you look into march i am just trying to figure out the puts and takes as well was december just a high mix and it is kind of reverting back to a more normal and then maybe you could talk about g timing of that and the impacts to gross margin in march versus prior expectations seas sobers yes i think as we stated little bit in prepared remarks is g is going to have a below corporate average margin which will have some impact on the margin as it grows that’s one of the impacts into q and then there is just general mix expectation as we go into q that’s going to have the gross margin itself off late blayne curtis okay and then maybe just from a revenue perspective i don’t know if you want to address it by either customers or maybe geographic it’s easier to talk about where you saw particular strength in the summer sean sobers i think it was essentially across the board i mean we’re seeing the highest level of wifi need across the board in general obviously you start to see our ac product the traditional or mainstream products x ac products continuing to pick up and n going down so you are starting to see that but it wasn’t any one geography or any one customer blayne curtis and then just one housekeeping the share count that you are implying for march just given all the moving pieces sean sobers it’s not much different blayne curtis okay sean sobers hold on a second we around  million yes it’s about that operator our next question comes from the line of quinn bolton of needham  company quinn bolton hey guys i will offer my congratulations on the nice revenue and margins sean i just wanted to come back to the fourth quarter results can you give us some sense was the upside sort of  you said was across the board was that really with existing customer or were there any new service providers that ramped in the quarter that also contributed to the results sean sobers yes quinn that’s a good question there was definitely growth across our existing customers for sure and then we had a couple of guys turning online in q but in insignificant amount so wasn’t really big number movers so it was really the existing customer base quinn bolton okay and any similar comments about q is that mostly existing customers or couple of guys that started to turn on in q start to contribute a little bit more substantially in that q sean sobers that’s exactly they are turning on and it should get bigger as we go through q and that’s our expectation so those newer customers in addition we expect to continue to maintain and grow our existing customer base quinn bolton great and then for sam this qualcomm x mimo solution was introduced this morning but i think their total throughput is about  gig versus your  gig solution i think the difference is sort of the  megahertz channel as you look at that really from the competitor are there other things that you think you’ve got a leadership position other than the channel capacity of your chipset versus their chipset dr sam heidari we’re definitely looking at that closely right now and studying it obviously we just saw the announcement today as well what you identified is definitely one of the parameters definitely this product that we have today which is shipping and is reaching a level of maturity and twice the performance is definitely an advantage there too because the level of maturity and work which has been on it it is definitely differentiation for the foreseen future and obviously performance as you mentioned quinn bolton okay and then last question from me i know that ax standard is still sort of being finalized any sort of sense when you think you might see these ax solutions coming to market dr sam heidari yes so we are still under same forecast as we have talked about that it will be toward the end of the year when you start seeing the ax products making into market you saw the announcements of qualcomm today which we do welcome in a sense that it does bring clients into the market we do believe it is going to take time for them to get those products ready and shipping and we are going to be ready with that with our super  ax aps to serve them the best way possible operator our next question comes from the line of suji desilva of roth capital suji desilva can you talk about the revenue visibility you see into the first quarter how do you guys think about it in terms of backlog coverage or any other ways you can describe… sean sobers yes i think one of the things that we’ve talked about in the past is our lead time from build to revenue is about  weeks so we have a really good view to the coming quarter you can quickly do the math and we’re half way through the quarter so we’re even more confident on where we think we’re going to be as we close out the quarter so visibility for the quarter is good and we’re obviously and looking towards q already suji desilva and then on the opex side can you talk specifically about the rd and whether there’s tape outs coming at certain points in the year that we should call out to know that there’ll be movement in rd versus a typical linearity sean sobers the tapeouts do cause some movements in rd there’s nothing of significance to note in q and if there are things to point out we’ll point them out to you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of anil doradla of william blair anil doradla a couple of questions so sam when you look at  clearly there’s an upgrade cycle going on with the docsis  whether you talk to the tuner guides antenna guides there’s clearly a trend there can you share how much you guys are going to benefit in  with this  dr sam heidari well that is a hard question for me to answer because i know it’s going to lead toward some customer assumptions but nevertheless any type of upgrade of the residential gateway it is in our benefit i would say docsis  is going to require a higher  well it’s a highest performance docsis yet to deploy and therefore it should have a matching wifi to go with it and when that cycle happens i hope that the cable providers are providing the best wifi performance to match their docsis performance anil doradla so your engagements if we go beyond the united states and north america do you see engagements with cable operators beyond north america at this stage in  dr sam heidari yes north america has been our  the design wins that we’ve had with the cable guys has been mostly focused around north america we’re exploring other geographies as a functional plan anil doradla and you talked about the state of the industry’s being around x some of my peers have asked questions about qualcomm solution so all these deployments that are going on is it fair to say that anything above x today is prewifi alliance certified dr sam heidari anything above x today is prewifi alliance certified that’s correct the features above x because everything above x is a super set of x so you can’t have the wifi alliance certification but some of those features have not made it to the wifi certification yet anil doradla and that’s your strength to some extent so as i look at  sam should i be looking at  most of your incremental growth especially as we look at some of the g some of the ac products largely structured around greater than x prewifi certified alliance deployments dr sam heidari so  is going to be a mix of new designs that we have had  or x designs so we are still wining designs in that arena as recent as last few months and we have obviously  we are the only one who is providing solutions above x or in x so  revenue growth is going to be a mix of both there are yet products to be introduced in the market which are not there or x raised to ac product going back to the earlier conversation this is again another way of looking at the product maturity matters so even though our competitors have announced x solutions for some time now we are still winning in that market even though our competitor has announced the x solution today which has yet to reach a level of maturity and the features set that we have today is not included in that so we strongly believe we will win with both products that we have in our disposal today in those markets anil doradla and if i can squeeze one in for sean sean can you give us some qualitative color on the breakdown between enterprise and service provider today sean sobers yes anil i think historically we are very focused on the service provider and from a revenue split perspective most of revenue is from service provider today we are focused on enterprise going forward as sam talked about and i think that will become more impactful as we leave  and into  operator i am showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to sam heidari for any additional or closing remarks dr sam heidari thank you maria and thank you everyone on the behalf of quintana’s worldwide team i would like to thank you for your interest and continued support operator that concludes the call operator thank you ladies and

updated may   sam heidari perfecting wifi technology by jahandad memarian with the goal of harnessing the untapped potential of iranianamericans and to build the capacity of the iranian diaspora in effecting positive change in the us and around the world the west asia council has launched a series of interviews that explore the personal and professional backgrounds of prominent iranianamericans who have made seminal contributions to their fields of endeavor our latest interviewee is sam heidari dr sam heidari serves as the chief executive officer of quantenna communications inc chairman of the board of directors of situne corporation board member of global semiconductor alliance and member of advisory board to the department of electrical engineering at the university of southern california previously dr heidari served as the chief technology officer of ikanos communications inc dr heidari has authored and published over a dozen refereed journals and conference papers for more details please click here tell our readers where you grew up and walk us through your background how did your family and surroundings influence you in your formative years i was born in northern iran in the green province of gilan by the caspian sea i moved to the us when i was  and finished my high school here in menlo park i think that there were two main factors that have influenced me till today first the value of education was ingrained in me like many iranians since an early age i grew up in a learned family surrounded by likeminded friends growing up the value of education was way above anything else such as wealth and luxury the second factor was the drive to make a positive difference in the lives of others which was also ingrained in me since an early age a combination of what my parents emphasized and the idealized version of our cultural background which stresses in its classical literary texts of prose and poetry that care for humanity is a main purpose of life what has been your personal key to success what were the biggest inspirations for your career it is a strange question for me since success can be defined in different ways i think of life as a journey and material success is very relative with an expiration date associated with it if you look at it financially given the poverty and the hardship in the world the majority of professionals living in this country are doing very well now the question is am i the top single digit percent or fraction of percent etc but who cares but the sources of my inspiration have evolved through time in all candor as a young man my inspiration and ambition was to make a name for myself i wanted to leave a legacy behind in a good way but i have come to realize that i enjoy the process of building nurturing and enhancing things things being products companies or my fruit trees in my backyard planting and harvesting it being part of the team to build the fastest dsl modem in the world or being part of the team to build a unique innovative company with a set of values and culture that is to become an innovation and creation engine give me similar satisfaction so does putting our homegrown fruits on the table the satisfaction of creating and building that is what drives me the process of building and looking at the end product and feeling growth inspire me under your leadership quantenna has been raising the bar on users experience by delivering the most advanced wifi hardware and software solutions and enabling new applications can you describe its significance wireless connectivity is an essential part of our lives today and within that wifi is the dominant interface in the world there are billions of wifi devices in operation today more than any other kind of connectivity wired or wireless in history meanwhile by pushing the performance bar on wifi quantenna is enabling applications that were not possible before through wireless technology our technology not only enables a new consumer experience but also ends up saving operating costs and equipment costs for service providers for example tv service providers such as your typical cable or satellite companies can bring programming into every room of your house or as matter of fact into your back yard without spending a lot of money on cabling your house or you dont have to worry about noaccess areas in your home or spend a lot of money on new equipment or service to fix it meeting the demands of seamless connectivity is only going to get more challenging with time as more devices are connected to the wifi network with bandwidth requirements per device increasing and with interference from other wifi networks increasing quantenna is working to make sure that success of wifi continues for years to come and new applications are more and more enabled on those wifi networks since you have a phd in electrical engineering can you address the relationship between academia and industry in your field how can their relationship be optimized university is obliviously where it all starts both in terms of talent development and ideas creation industry is in continuous need of welltrained and educated talent and a continuous supply of engineering and science talent is a core requirement of our economy but it is also certain that many of the great ideas of our time were created in academia away from the pressure of quarterly financial reporting from the other end of the spectrum a main contribution of industry to academia besides providing financial support through grants is to provide the feedback required to close the loop on intended use of academic research no system ever evolves for better without a feedback mechanism industry must be the feedback mechanism to academia and the builder of bridges to bring ideas to practice and enabling the commercialization of ideas to see if and how ideas work in practice you have spent almost all of your career in startups how is that different from working for large companies first i must say that startups are not for everyone just as large companies are not for everyone to use an analogy being in a large company is like a bus ride in general it is safe and predictable but you are only a passenger with little input of where it goes and when it goes but the safety could go away when a crazy or drunk bus driver takes over and you have zero say in the drivers selection small companies start like a bike ride it takes more energy but the ride could be fun and you are in control on rainy days especially when you have a flat tire you regret being there but the ride on the nice days makes up for everything it is the challenge that you cannot let go of and the journey itself independent of the destination makes you a better person you are in charge so you can take the short cut in the woods to be way ahead of the bus the excitement of the dealing with first taken paths the excitement of the unknown and chaos in front of you and defining it these make up for a lot it is up to you to grow the bicycle to a motorcycle or graduate to an eventual sports car or even a bus you are in charge of the ride on the team level in a startup there is a huge camaraderie and there should be a huge care factor everyone in a startup should realize that while everyone has an influence on the direction they are all rowing together for a common goal they will all succeed together or sink together there is little office politics furthermore in todays economy where wall street quarterly reporting is dictating much of your business the most innovative work happens in the startups if you like to work on the latest and greatest with faster impact startups are probably for you how do you see silicon valleys innovation ecosystem can it be replicated the short answer is no you cannot and here is why technology startups are impacted in general by five factors  access to capital  government regulations and  access to experienced management and technical talent  local culture of innovation and entrepreneurship and  a supportive ecosystem of customers and partners while one can argue that most of these could be provided in other geographies silicon valley is unique in most or all of these factors  access to capital no jurisdiction in the world is as rich in venture capital as siliconvalley while we see that governments are financing startups and technology innovation in many jurisdictions essentially to imitate silicon valley but it is not the same silicon valley is financially driven and is riding on decades of investment and entrepreneurship experience the fact that they have no other motivation than building great standalone businesses does manifest itself in the great companies technologies and outcomes that we have seen coming from this area  government regulations i must say that while government does provide little or no financial incentives to start a business in california it has not overly regulated the process of starting a business and the flexible labor laws do enable the risk taking nature of the startup  access to experienced management and cuttingedge technical talent some of the greatest universities in the world are located in california and some within miles of silicon valley which supply graduates to areas economic and technological engine you seldom see these graduates leaving the area for work elsewhere the historically entrenched culture of migration and the ease of movement from overseas to the us  and the reverse  provides access to the best and brightest talent in the world the open immigration policies of the us for talented and motivated individuals enables access to a global pool of technology talent the multicultural environment of the valley encourages many to move here from the four corners of the earth and feel at home  local culture of innovation and entrepreneurship put simply there is nowhere like it in the world the conversations in the restaurants bars parks and bus stops is about the latest and greatest companies as well as innovation and entrepreneurship it does not take long to convince your spouse that you are letting go of your well paid job to join a group of young kids with great ideas the historical record of success provides a very unique environment the model of building a growing company is well understood and is common knowledge  ecosystem many of your present and future customers and partners are close by it makes it easier to validate ideas develop winning designs and have access to complementary technology when needed there are thousands of companies and businesses that can complement you within miles from your business is based you hold more than  us and international patents can you tell us which ones have been your greatest achievement what is the first thing new inventors should consider what should they avoid i am not sure if i have a favorite there were a couple that have a level of excitement associated with them and some took a long time to become reality in products they were a bit too much ahead of their time the first thing that an inventor new or old should consider is the problem statement what is the problem that heshe is trying to solve they say that need is the mother of invitation you cannot innovate for the sake of innovation the problem comes ahead of the solution there are too many times when i see that we have a solution that is looking for a problem that is not the most productive approach to innovation what was your motivation for writing timefull friendship what is this book about this short childrens book is about three friends mr hour mrs minute and miss second and it is meant as a fun educational means to teach the concept of time and the operation of a clock to kids i first got the idea during my english class when i had just moved here where i was asked to describe the concept of machinery and i thought that by giving life and character to the building blocks of a clock we could make it fun for kids to learn it took me many years but it was a personal desire to take the class story to the next stage by getting it published the second motivation or what gave me energy to work on it were my kids it was a great opportunity for me to interact with my kids in the process i did appreciate their thoughts and feedback all along and in the end we committed to give our proceedings to childrens charities i hope it thought them and me about the most important things in life jahandad memarian media advisor at the iranian americans
