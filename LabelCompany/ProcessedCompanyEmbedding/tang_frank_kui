kui tang kui tang machine teacher when you are perfectly free to feel stuck or not stuck then youre unstuck alan watts papers talks code expository cv resume i have worked on machine learning research for nearly five years i had the privilege to work with prof tony jebara while i was an undergrad at columbia university and then to continue my phd program there under prof david blei as well my academic work has included approximate inference in graphical models of both directed and undirected varieties convex optimization probabilistic word vector embeddings and probabilistic models for matchings permutations and graph structures after receiving my ms i left in order to focus on realworld applications of machine learning machine learning will grow increasingly fundamental to technology and society as the quantity and complexity of our data and our ambition to make use thereof increase without bound the field requires algorithms that scale to big data are practical and easy to use outside the academy and are grounded in firm mathematical principles so that their accuracy and speed can be depended upon for missioncritical applications papers k tang n ruozzi d
