claim amount of about half a billion too much but then the ancillary market clause was found disney lawyers tried to indicate a decline situation which reveal some of the problems in the company abc had declining rating and increasing costs while the film segment had two film failures while neither party revealed the settlement amount it is estimated at  million eisners controlling style
