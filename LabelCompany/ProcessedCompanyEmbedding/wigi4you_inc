update asu  development stage entities topic    amongst other things the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from topic  thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap  in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information on the statements of income cash flows and shareholders equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity   disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage  the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim reporting periods beginning after march   however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued   revenue recognition   the company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with fasb asc  “revenue recognition”  revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured  the company recognizes revenues on sales of its services based on the terms of the customer agreement  the customer agreement takes the form of either a contract or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price  if the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the customer   fair value of financial instruments   the company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement   level  – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   level  – inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability   in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments   f        as of march   and june   the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair value approximated fair value due to the shortterm nature and maturity of these instruments   advertising   advertising expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  a change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on wigiyou inc’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred actual results could differ from those estimates wigiyou inc’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented   capital stock   the company has authorized seventy five million  shares of common stock with a par value of  seven million two hundred and fifty thousand  shares and five million two hundred and fifty thousand  shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as of march   and june   respectively   income taxes   the company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income regardless of when reported for tax purposes   note b – going concern   the companys financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern   under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   during the next year the company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the securities and exchange commission and the payment of expenses associated with app development the company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital   historically it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the company’s stock or through loans from private investors although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing the company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders   f        in the past year the company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock for the coming year the company plans to continue to fund the company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above   note c – common stock   on february   company issued  common shares to the director of the company at

nearest onehundred thousandth     a stock splits and reverse stock splits if a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred then once such split has become effective the adjustment factor will be

events if the fund is delisted liquidated or otherwise terminated a  liquidation event  and a successor or substitute exchange traded fund exists that the calculation agent determines in its sole discretion to be comparable to the fund then upon the calculation agents notification of that determination to the trustee and the company any subsequent fund closing price for the fund will be determined by reference to the fund closing price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a  successor fund  with such adjustments as the calculation agent determines are appropriate to account for the economic effect of such substitution on the holder of this security if the fund undergoes a liquidation event prior to and such liquidation event is continuing on the date that any fund closing price of the fund is to be determined and the    calculation agent determines that no successor fund is available at such time then the calculation agent will in its discretion calculate the fund closing price for the fund on such date by a computation methodology that the calculation agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate the fund provided that if the calculation agent determines in its discretion that it is not practicable to replicate the fund including but not limited to the instance in which the sponsor of the index underlying the fund discontinues publication of that index then the calculation agent will calculate the fund closing price for the fund in accordance with the formula last used to calculate such fund closing price before such liquidation event but using only those securities that were held by the fund immediately prior to such liquidation event without any rebalancing or substitution of such securities following such liquidation event if a successor fund is selected or the calculation agent calculates the fund closing price as a substitute for the fund such successor fund or fund closing price will be used as a substitute for the fund for all purposes including for purposes of determining whether a market disruption event exists if any event is both a reorganization event and a liquidation event such event will be treated as a reorganization event for purposes of this security unless the calculation agent makes the determination referenced in the last sentence of the section entitled antidilution adjustmentsreorganization events above alternate calculation if at any time the method of calculating the fund or a successor fund or the underlying index is changed in a material respect or if the fund or a successor fund is in any other way modified so that the fund does not in the opinion of the calculation agent fairly represent the price of the securities of the fund or such successor fund had such changes or modifications not been made then the calculation agent may at the close of business in new york city on the date that any fund closing price is to be determined make such calculations and adjustments as in the good faith judgment of the calculation agent may be necessary in order to arrive at a closing price of an exchange traded fund comparable to the fund or such successor fund as the case may be as if such changes or modifications had not been made and calculate the fund closing price and the redemption amount with reference to such adjusted closing price of the fund or such successor fund as applicable calculation agent the calculation agent will determine the redemption amount and the ending price in addition the calculation agent will i determine if adjustments are required to the fund closing price andor the adjustment factor under the circumstances described in this security ii if the fund undergoes a liquidation event select a successor fund or if no successor fund is available determine the fund closing price of the fund and iii determine whether a market disruption event or

for the first twelve  months after successful completion of the company offering none of the expenditures itemized is listed in any particular order of priority or importance since the company does not intend to pay any offering expenses from the proceeds from the company offering and assuming that       or   of the company offering is sold the net aggregate proceeds will be allocated as follows expenditure item         professional fees         advertising and marketing         design software and web application         office and miscellaneous expenses         total         there is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this offering no expenses associated with this offering will be paid by the company and any funds received from the sale of stock by the company will be immediately available to us  since the web design and software adaptation are critical to our success if we do not successfully sell  of the company offering we will depend on other funding to complete the project such as loans from our officers or shareholders the above expenditures are defined as follows professional fees pertains to legal services and accounting fees that will be incurred by the company costs associated with being a public company pertains to filing fees associated with edgar filings stock transfer agent fees and other miscellaneous fees advertising and marketing pertains to the cost of advertising and marketing our services design software and web application pertains to the development of our software and applications and integrating it with the web site office and miscellaneous expenses these are the costs of operating our office including telephone services mail stationary accounting office supplies bank service fees and charges and other miscellaneous expenses associated with running our office working capital pertains to the funds allocated to general working capital there is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire  from the sale of stock by the company under this offering therefore the following details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only   or  of this offering if  of this offering is sold we estimate that this would provide sufficient capital to begin operations and develop our business plan it may however place potential restraints on our ability to handle unforeseen expenses attributable to working capital and may require us to seek additional funding if only  of this offering is sold we estimate that this would provide sufficient capital to commence with operation and development of the business plan but we would only be able to spend  to spend on advertising and marketing our services under this scenario we estimate that we would be able to generate enough revenues to sustain our business should we be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business we will have to find other sources of financing if we raise less than  we will have difficulty in implementing our business plan our expenses would be prioritized in order of importance and would affect how we allocate funds for developing the business if less than  is raised we would be able to develop our website with less features and we would not be able to allocate any funds to advertising and marketing if only  of the offering is sold we would still incur expected professional legal and accounting fees of  which will have to be paid to maintain reporting status during the next  months we will not be able to apply sufficient funds to any other areas of developing our business such as advertising and marketing and would only provide a minimal amount to develop the website and software this would seriously hinder the development of our business and our ability to generate revenues we would not be able to develop the business andor generate any revenues in the first year without additional financing the business of an application providing a comprehensive entire package of event planning and concierge services is very competitive barriers to entry on the internet are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful websites operated by proven companies that offer similar niche social networking to event planning service which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service if we cannot gain

on march   wigiyou intends to provide a website and mobile app to assist event planners in locating performers bands and speakers booking locations and planning events in areas around the united states and canada   wigiyou’s business and corporate address is derech magdiel  hodhasharon israel  and our telephone number is  our registered agent for service of process is state agent and transfer syndicate inc  north curry street carson city nevada  our fiscal year end is june    our business is in the startup phase and we have no operational history to date we have generated no revenues from operations and cannot guarantee we will generate revenues in the future   at the present time we are classified as a “shell company” under rule  of the securities act rule b of the exchange act as such all restricted securities presently held by the affiliates of our company may not be resold in reliance on rule  until  we file form  information with the securities and exchange commission “sec” when we cease to be a “shell company”  we have filed all reports as required by section  and d of the securities act for twelve consecutive months and  one year has elapsed from the time we file the current form  type information with the sec reflecting our status as an entity that is not a shell company   bankruptcy or similar proceedings   there has been no bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding involving the company   reorganization purchase or sale of assets   there have been no material reclassifications mergers consolidations or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets involving the company                effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business   the company will be subject to numerous national international regional state and local laws the company does not know when or whether additional legislation may pass or whether any such legislation would relate to the types of services currently planned to be provided by the company or which the company intends to develop accordingly the company cannot predict the effect if any that any such future regulation may have on its business   research and development activities during the last two years   we have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception   outsourcing of software programmers   wigiyou plans to hire independent subcontractors programmers and web site developers to customize the public domain software that will be the foundation to our website and mobile application we believe that these services may be obtained at competitive prices from software outsourcing companies operating in the united states however we may encounter good programmers at competitive rates within the united states at this time we have no arrangements with any vendors or third parties to obtain hardware or programming   number of total employees and number of full time employees   wigiyou has no employees our sole officer and director is donating his time to the development of the company and intends to do whatever work is necessary in order to bring us to the point of earning revenues we have no other employees and do not foresee hiring any additional employees in the near future we will be engaging independent contractors and subcontractors to design and develop our website manage our internet marketing efforts   item a risk factors   an investment in these securities involves a high degree of risk and is speculative in nature in addition to the other information regarding the company contained in this prospectus you should consider many important factors in determining whether to purchase shares following are what we believe are material risks related to the company and an investment in the company investors are urged to perform their own due diligence with the help of their investment accounting legal andor other professionals and to make an independent decision regarding an investment in the shares    risks associated with our business   our independent auditors have issued an audit opinion for wigiyou which includes a statement describing our going concern status our financial status creates a doubt whether we will continue as a going concern   as described in note b of our accompanying financial statements our auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding the company this means there is substantial doubt we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and investors could lose part or all of their investment in the company   we lack an operating history and have losses which we expect to continue into the future there is no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues if we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably we may suspend or cease operations   we were incorporated on march   and we have not fully developed our proposed business operations and have realized no revenues we have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made our net loss for the years ended june   and  was  and  respectively most of which is for professional fees our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon     • completion of the share offering                  • our ability to attract customers who will use our services     • our ability to generate revenue through the sale of our services   based upon current plans we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating revenues we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenues in the future in the event the company is unable to generate revenues it may be required to seek additional funding such funding may not be available or may not be available on terms which are beneficial andor acceptable to the company in the event the company cannot generate revenues andor secure additional financing the company may be forced to cease operations and investors will likely lose some or all of their investment in the company   because management does not have relevant experience in managing a software and electronic products company our business has a higher risk of failure   our sole officer and director has limited business experience related to the marketing and development of event planning and concierge services and applications consequently management will initially have to rely on the experience of third parties further we have budgeted only  toward sales and marketing efforts over the next  months which by industry standards is a very limited amount of capital with which to launch our effort given the relatively small marketing budget and limited experience of our officers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful further if our initial efforts to create a market for our website are not successful there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified individuals with marketing and sales expertise to attract subscribers to our website our future success will depend amount other factors upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that our application will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services there can be no assurance that they will be successful in obtaining adequate assistance or cooperation from third parties at a cost consistent with the resources of the company   we have no clients or customers and we cannot guarantee we will ever have any even if we obtain clients or customers there is no assurance that we will make a profit   we have no clients or customers we have not identified any clients or customers and we cannot guarantee we will ever have any even if we obtain clients or customers for our services there is no guarantee that we will develop products andor services that our clientscustomers will want to use if we are unable to attract enough customersclients to purchase services and any products we may develop or sell it will have a negative effect on our ability to generate sufficient revenue from which we can operate or expand our business the lack of sufficient revenues will have a negative effect on the ability of the company to continue operations and it could force the company to cease operations   some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than do we   there exists in our industry many competitors that have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than do we there are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful we are a relatively late entry into a mature market for electronic concierge services and applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop a profitable niche in this market   we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of an application providing a comprehensive entire package of event planning and concierge services is very competitive barriers to entry on the internet are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful websites operated by proven companies that offer similar niche social networking to event planning service which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected                we do not have any additional source of funding for our business plans and may be unable to find any such funding if and when needed resulting in the failure of our business   other than the shares offered no other source of capital has been identified or sought as a result we do not have an alternate source of funds if we do find an alternative source of capital the terms and conditions of acquiring such capital may result in dilution and the resultant lessening of value of the shares of stockholders as widely reported the global and domestic financial markets have been extremely volatile in recent months if such conditions and constraints continue or if there is no investor appetite to finance our specific business we may not be able to acquire additional financing through credit markets or equity markets even if additional financial is available it may not be available on terms favorable to us at this time we have not identified or secured sources of additional financing our failure to secure additional financing when it becomes required will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business   if we are not successful in raising sufficient fund we will be faced with several options    abandon our business plans cease operations and go out of business    continue to seek alternative and acceptable sources of capital or    bring in additional capital that may result in a change of control    we possess minimal capital which may severely restrict our ability to develop our services if we are unable to raise additional capital our business will fail    we possess minimal capital and must limit the amount of marketing we can perform with respect to our services we feel we require a minimum of  to provide sufficient capital to commence with operations and development of the business plan our business plan contemplates the development of a website and associated software to assist users to find local events performers bands and speakers our limited marketing activities may not attract enough clients to generate sufficient revenue to operate profitably expand our services implement our business plan or continue operating our business our limited marketing capabilities may have a negative effect on our business and may cause us to limit or cease our business operations which could result in investors losing some or all of their investment in the company   if our estimates related to future expenditures are erroneous or inaccurate our business will fail and you could lose your entire investment   our success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our management’s estimates of our future cost expenditures for legal and accounting services including those we expect to incur as a publicly reporting company for website marketing and development expenses and for administrative expenses which management estimates to be approximately between  and  over the next twelve months if such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate or if we encounter unforeseen costs we may not be able to carry out our business plan which could result in the failure of our business and the loss of your entire investment   our auditor has raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern and if we are unable to continue our business our shares may have little or no value   the company’s ability to become a profitable operating company is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues andor obtain financing adequate to fulfill its research and market introduction activities and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure has raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern we plan to attempt to raise additional equity capital by selling shares and if necessary through one or more private placement or public offerings   however the doubts raised relating to our ability to continue as a going concern may make our shares an unattractive investment for potential investors these factors among others may make it difficult to raise any additional capital                any significant disruption in our website presence or services could result in a loss of customers   our plans call for our customers to access our service through our website our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our customers will be dependent upon the reliable performance of our website network infrastructure and fulfillment processes how we deliver services purchased by our customers prolonged or frequent interruptions in any of these systems could make our website unavailable or unusable which could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and potential customers   our servers will likely be vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations and loss misuse or theft of data it is likely that our website will periodically experience directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service which is not uncommon for webbased businesses any attempts by hackers to disrupt our website service or our internal systems if successful could harm our business be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation  efforts to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of our services any significant disruption to our website or internal computer systems could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business and results of operations   the loss of the services of either our sole officer and director or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our website and sell our services   the development of our website and the marketing of our services will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel management and other resources our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officer omri revivo who is developing our business and on our ability to identify and retain competent consultants and employees with the skills required to execute our business objectives the loss of the services of officer or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our website and sell our services which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth      our sole officer and director may have conflicts of interest in that he has other time commitments that will prevent him from devoting fulltime to our operations which may affect our operations    because our sole officer and director who is responsible for all our business activities will not devote his full working time to operations and management of us the implementation of our business plans may be impeded our officer and director has other obligations and time commitments which will slow our operations and may reduce our financial results and as a result we may not be able to continue with our operations mr revivo will devote  hours per week additionally when he becomes unable to handle the daily operations on his own we may not be able to hire additional qualified personnel to replace him in a timely manner if this event should occur we may not be able to reach profitable which might result in the loss of some or all of your investment in our common stock   we are dependent upon our current officer   we currently are managed by one officer and we are entirely dependent upon him in order to conduct our operations if he should resign or die there will be no one to run wigiyou and the company has no key man insurance if our current officer is no longer able to serve as such and we are unable to find other persons to replace him it will have a negative effect on our ability to continue active business operations and could result in investors losing some or all of their investment in the company   our business model may require the use of outside personnel who may not be available when needed   we will require the service of software programmers we intend to obtain these services through software outsourcing companies operating in the united states and israel software outsourcing companies contract with programmers in countries such as pakistan malaysia china the philippines israel ireland mexico russia and chile these countries offer low costs well trained personnel with english language capabilities the services of offshore programmers may be overseen by third party outsourcing companies whose performance is beyond our control we cannot reliably predict if the services will be available as we need them                there is a potential security risk using foreign programmers   we will make reasonable efforts to assure that the outsourcing companies have verifiable security procedures in place however by outsourcing we face the potential loss of control under which our software is developed without programmers of our own we will rely on the integrity of the outsourcing company to examine source code to assure that there are no potential security risks   our controlling stockholders have significant influence over the company   as of june   omri revivo our sole officer and director owns  of the outstanding common stock which becomes  if all of the shares offered are sold as a result revivo possesses significant influence over our affairs his stock ownership and relationships with members of our board of directors of which mr revivo is the only one may have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company which in turn could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock   one investor hold a controlling interest in our stock as a result the ability of minority shareholders to influence our affairs is extremely limited   our president owns a controlling interest in our outstanding common stock he has the ability to control all matters submitted to the stockholders of wigiyou for approval including the election and removal of directors a significant change to the composition of our board could lead to a change in management and our business plan any such transition could lead to among other things a decline in service levels disruption in our operations and departures of key personnel which could in turn harm our business   moreover this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control which in turn could materially and adversely affect the market price of the common stock   having only one director limits our ability to establish effective independent corporate governance procedures and increases the control of our president over operations and business decisions   we have only one director who is our principal executive officer and secretary accordingly we cannot establish board committees comprised of independent members to oversee functions like compensation or audit issues   until we have a larger board of directors that would include some independent members if ever there will be limited oversight of our president’s decisions and activities and little ability for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions even if they are not in the best interests of minority shareholders   the lack of public company experience of our management could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of us securities laws   our management lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by the sarbanesoxley act of  our management has never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis our management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal regulatory compliance and reporting requirements including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financials reporting any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” which is necessary to maintain our public company status if we were to fail to fulfill those obligations our ability to continue as a us public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment                because we are currently considered a “shell company” within the meaning of rule b pursuant to the securities exchange act of  the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their shares may be limited by applicable regulations   we are currently considered a “shell company” as that term is defined in rule b pursuant to the securities exchange act of  and rule  pursuant to the securities act of  in that we currently have nominal operations and nominal assets other than cash accordingly the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their shares may be limited by applicable regulations   as a result of our classification as a “shell company” our investors are not allowed to rely on the “safe harbor” provisions of rule  promulgated pursuant to the securities act of  so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with the sale of securities until one year from the date that we cease to be a “shell company” additionally as a result of our classification a shell company     • investors should consider shares of our common stock to be significantly risky and illiquid investments     • we may not register our securities on form s an abbreviated form of registration statement     • our ability to attract additional funding to sustain our operations may be limited significantly     we can provide no assurance or guarantee that we will cease to be a “shell company” and accordingly we can provide no assurance or guarantee that there will be a liquid market for our shares accordingly investors may not be able to sell our shares and lose their investments in the company   we do not expect to file a form a on a preeffective basis because our common stock is not registered under the exchange act we will not be subject to the federal proxy rules and our directors executive officers and  beneficial holders will
