favorite email print text size  − fechheimer brothers flying cross — december   while quality and service are critical to all apparel manufacturers fechheimer brothers co takes them to a whole new level   the company founded in cincinnati oh in  and still based there is the leader in uniforms and gear for public safety markets such as police fire and ems under the flying cross and fechheimer brands owned by berkshire hathaway warren buffetts investment company it also makes uniforms for the military postal workers train conductors and even baseball umpires   but its core business is providing shirts and pants for police officers whose working conditions demand higher standards for quality and consistency than the average apparel customer   its more like gear than apparel says bob getto fechheimers president and ceo youre really putting together a product that somebodys going have to look great in and perform in seven days a week  weeks a year and in four seasons and for a number of years that uniform has to look the same so the quality with which we produce the garment is well above the standards of the commercial market   providing performance and consistency critical to the law enforcement business is the ability to present a consistent uniform appearance across the police force in order to foster a level of respect with the public they serve to help preserve their authority this requires that a new recruits uniform matches the seasoned veterans   they have to look exactly like the people that have been working there five years says getto who joined fechheimer in february of this year after a year career in the textile and apparel industry at burlington industries and duro textiles the color and the make of the shirt must be very consistent or it will impact their image in the community   in addition to its focus on quality fechheimer has to stay on the cutting edge of innovation including in the area of performance fabrics which are often more critical in the public safety arena   all the performance things that you hear about in fabrics really matter in the uniform business says getto its not just a gimmick to sell something   for fechheimer the needs of the public safety markets require that it not only stays on top of the latest innovations in moisturewicking antimicrobial stretch and colorretention but also keeps tabs on developments in niche areas of the market   for ems workers for instance fechheimer employs fabrics that blood cant pass through for the troops in iraq and afghanistan the company is working with canadian outdoor apparel specialist arcteryx on fireresistant nomelt nodrip uniforms to protect troops from incendiary devices which have tended to melt regular fabric to a soldiers body   for police officers fechheimer continually works to develop fabrics and new methods of general construction to meet the needs of a more demanding job   it used to be that when a law enforcement officer said stop people actually stopped now people run away try to run over them with a car shoot at them or tackle them says getto so the performance of the uniform in that environment is different than it was before   body armor  not very common  years ago  is now worn by almost all police officers some wear it under their shirts and some wear it on the outside fechheimer also makes waistbands able to support a topound duty belt containing an officers gun pepperspray billy club radio and handcuffs it also has to provide the right fits and styles for women who comprise about  percent of the us police force   youve got to bring solutions and the key word is solutions in uniforms notes getto it really has to solve a problem   reliable service keeps officers focused on their jobs another cornerstone to fechheimers success in the public service sector has been reliable service fechheimer has become a trusted resource over the years not only because of its consistent quality but also because of its large instock program that enables it to fill orders quickly  frequently on nextday delivery chiefs of police and fire turn to fechheimer and its  north american dealers for nextday shipments   chiefs really dont want to worry about how they are going to get their guys in uniforms and whether or not the uniforms are going to be good quality and look the same says getto   were a very trusted source of supply for a program that is critical to their image and critical to their performance we put that program in place and support it like weve always done and they just forget about it and go do what they do well   one way fechheimer is making life easier for its customers is through its proprietary quartermaster software program which enables a department to manage its uniform distribution program to its officers   under a program recently set up for the massachusetts bay transportation authority mbta for instance transit employees can walk up to computer terminals to order their sweater outerwear pants or shirts and the items are delivered to them   were making it easy for a city to distribute its uniform program to their employees says getto its one thing to get the uniform right but its another thing to deliver it to  people on a timely basis with the turnover they have to deal with   customers also count on fechheimer for special orders for instance the company made a uniform for   miami heat basketball star shaquille oneil also a reserve officer for the orange county sheriffs department and a super plussize uniform was recently made for a sumo wrestler in hawaii   manufacturing knowhow spurs innovation partly to meet this demand for special orders fechheimer still manufactures close to  percent of its product at three plants in the united states it also produces domestically because military and postal products by law must be made in the united states and some law enforcement departments only use usmade product as well   having some inhouse manufacturing expertise also helps fechheimer come up with solutions for its customers it then works with its outside sourcing partners to push design and fabric innovations across the uniform marketplace says getto   fechheimers ability to deliver consistency has been helped by having only three owners in its 6year history this includes the founding fechheimer family the heldman family that ran it from  to 6 and berkshire hathaway which acquired the company in 6 getto believes fechheimer fits berkshire hathaways focus of investing in companies that provide its customers with core underlying value   berkshire likes to be in businesses where real value is provided says getto when you provide real value its not that easy to be replaced v related links brooks sports  grand allstar
