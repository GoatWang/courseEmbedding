management jure sola — biography  merging sanmina with sci sources for further information home business biographies sz jure sola — biography jure sola – chairman and chief executive officer sanminasci corporation nationality american born  in croatia education san jose state university bs  family married michelle maiden name unknown children three career lika corporation – various management positions sanmina corporation – various management positions – chairman and president sanminasci corporation – cochairman and ceo – chairman and ceo address sanminasci corporation  north first street san jose california  httpwwwsanminacom ■ jure sola founded sanmina corporation in  for the manufacture of advanced electroniccircuit cards back planes and enclosures for the telecommunications market in  sanmina completed its acquisition of the competitor sci and in  sola became the chief executive officer and chairman of the newly named sanminasci corporation as of  the merger was the largest ever in the electronic manufacturing services industry the combined company was a leading global electronics contract manufacturer building parts and providing manufacturingmanagement services for originalequipment manufacturers in the communications industrial and medical instrumentation and computertechnology sectors building the electronic manufacturing services business born in croatia sola came to the united states as a yearold in  after receiving an engineering degree from san jose state university he joined the management of the electronic manufacturing company lika producing electronic transducers and control instruments for factory automation in  he cofounded sanmina and began serving the company in various management capacities sola became chairman and president of sanmina in  for most of its history the contract manufacturing business received little respect many engineering firms preferred to design products and then let originalequipment manufacturers oems build the parts in the s most of the companies that manufactured end products decided to reduce redundant resources and staff by seeking out other firms with which to outsource ongoing production sola took advantage of this trend early on to advance sanmina ranked ninth among contract manufacturers in  the company avoided consumer products in order to concentrate on highend networking and telecommunications applications sola stated his business strategy in electronic business  we go after the products that are more difficult to manufacture internally august   throughout much of its existence sanmina maintained a  percent operating margin a figure that impressed other contract manufacturers sola credited the companys results to the niches that he chose good management and a history of closely watched costs comparing sanminas operations from well after it became profitable to those of its infancy when the company had almost as much debt as it did revenue sola remarked we dont run any differently  electronic business  august   merging sanmina with sci in the s oems and contract manufacturers had begun to operate like identical companies—both had become truly cooperative and integrated contract manufacturers like sci joined oem design sessions and provided services throughout the supply chain from designing to box building sci was a pioneer in vertical integration once designing and producing almost everything for the apollo space project by the latter part of the s sci derived most of its revenue from personal computers and government contracts in the late s sola decided that he needed to give sanmina a more diversified revenue stream by appealing to a broader group of customers he pursued a friendly merger with the larger sci sola noted we built the company to a certain level with niche technology but we needed to have the fundamentals of system assembly in place  electronic buyers news  december   acquiring sci would result in quicker improvements than would developing such capabilities internally sanmina derived more than twothirds of its revenue from the communications market which was highly depressed at the time the substantially cyclical nature of that business as well as high operating leverages made diversification necessary for sanminas survival in july  sola and sanmina took over sci in a stock swap valued at about  billion making it the largest acquisition in the history of the electronic manufacturing services industry the merger saved the new sanminasci about – million annually through combined operational efficiencies and the internal sourcing of components the new company operated manufacturing facilities in  countries and had annual revenue in the  billion range it was ranked among the five largest electronic manufacturers in the world sanminasci generated revenue from communications highend computing personal computers multimedia and medicalaerospaceindustrial sales with a technicalsales organization that he now personally deemed the largest in the electronic manufacturing industry sola set his sights on asia planning to take advantage of the cheaper labor available in china he explained our approach is winning newproduct introductions and designs in japan but doing the manufacturing in china  electronic buyers news  december   analysts expressed concerns over solas ability to blend the business models of sanmina and sci sanmina provided high levels of manufacturing technology to clients while sci specialized in highvelocity assembly the two platforms required different customer interactions and pricing strategies sola maintained that the potential of the acquisition outweighed the risks sources for further

jure sola founded sanmina corporation in  for the manufacture of advanced electroniccircuit cards back planes and enclosures for the telecommunications market in  sanmina completed its acquisition of the competitor sci and in  sola became the chief executive officer and chairman of the newly named sanminasci corporation as of  the merger was the largest ever in the electronic manufacturing services industry the combined company was a leading global electronics contract manufacturer building parts and providing manufacturingmanagement services for originalequipment manufacturers in the communications industrial and medical instrumentation and computertechnology sectors building the electronic manufacturing services business born in croatia sola came to the united states as a yearold in  after receiving an engineering degree from san jose state university he joined the management of the electronic manufacturing company lika producing electronic transducers and control instruments for factory automation in  he cofounded sanmina and began serving the company in various management capacities sola became chairman and president of sanmina in  for most of its history the contract manufacturing business received little respect many engineering firms preferred to design products and then let originalequipment manufacturers oems build the parts in the s most of the companies that manufactured end products decided to reduce redundant resources and staff by seeking out other firms with which to outsource ongoing production sola took advantage of this trend early on to advance sanmina ranked ninth among contract manufacturers in  the company avoided consumer products in order to concentrate on highend networking and telecommunications applications sola stated his business strategy in electronic business  we go after the products that are more difficult to manufacture internally august   throughout much of its existence sanmina maintained a  percent operating margin a figure that impressed other contract manufacturers sola credited the companys results to the niches that he chose good management and a history of closely watched costs comparing sanminas operations from well after it became profitable to those of its infancy when the company had almost as much debt as it did revenue sola remarked we dont run any differently electronic business august   merging sanmina with sci in the s oems and contract manufacturers had begun to operate like identical companies—both had become truly cooperative and integrated contract manufacturers like sci joined oem design sessions and provided services throughout the supply chain from designing to box building sci was a pioneer in vertical integration once designing and producing almost everything for the apollo space project by the latter part of the s sci derived most of its revenue from personal computers and government contracts in the late s sola decided that he needed to give sanmina a more diversified revenue stream by appealing to a broader group of customers he pursued a friendly merger with the larger sci sola noted we built the company to a certain level with niche technology but we needed to have the fundamentals of system assembly in place electronic buyers news december   acquiring sci would result in quicker improvements than would developing such capabilities internally sanmina derived more than twothirds of its revenue from the communications market which was highly depressed at the time the substantially cyclical nature of that business as well as high operating leverages made diversification necessary for sanminas survival in july  sola and sanmina took over sci in a stock swap valued at about  billion making it the largest acquisition in the history of the electronic manufacturing services industry the merger saved the new sanminasci about – million annually through combined operational efficiencies and the internal sourcing of components the new company operated manufacturing facilities in  countries and had annual revenue in the  billion range it was ranked among the five largest electronic manufacturers in the world sanminasci generated revenue from communications highend computing personal computers multimedia and medicalaerospaceindustrial sales with a technicalsales organization that he now personally deemed the largest in the electronic manufacturing industry sola set his sights on asia planning to take advantage of the cheaper labor available in china he explained our approach is winning newproduct introductions and designs in japan but doing the manufacturing in china electronic buyers news december   analysts expressed concerns over solas ability to blend the business models of sanmina and sci sanmina provided high levels of manufacturing technology to clients while sci specialized in highvelocity assembly the two platforms required different customer interactions and pricing strategies sola maintained that the potential of the acquisition outweighed the risks sources for further information ristelhueber robert sanminasci begins to take shape as merger is completed electronic buyers news december   p  —— special
