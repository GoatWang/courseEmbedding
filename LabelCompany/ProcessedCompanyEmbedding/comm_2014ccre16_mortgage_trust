underlying collateral pool since issuance as of the february  distribution date the pools aggregate principal balance has been reduced by  no loans are defeased interest shortfalls are currently affecting class g there is currently one fitch loan of concern which represents the only specially serviced loan in the pool  four loans  are currently on the master servicers watchlist including the largest  broadway and fourth largest google and amazon office portfolio loans in the pool both loans are on the watchlist for a decline in their debt service coverage ratios dscr since issuance both loans had concession periods which were accounted for and escrowed for at issuance neither is considered to be a fitch loan of concern the other two watchlist loans are both related to minor issues and are anticipated to be resolved without transfer to the special servicer the specially serviced loan is secured by a hotel portfolio comprised of a total of  rooms from three hotels a quality inn modern inn and comfort inn all of which are located throughout indiana the loan was transferred to the special servicer in november  as a result of the borrower terminating their inplace franchise agreement in august  without lender notification according to the special servicer they are working with the borrower to remedy the default by approving the change in their franchise agreement the loan continues to perform with underwritten expectations with a  partialyear net operating income noi dscr of x which is nearly identical to issuance the largest loan in the pool is  broadway which is secured by a story office building located in the financial district in new york city the loan is subject to a  million paripassu note that is within the comm cr transaction as of september   broadway was  occupied which is in line with issuance the yeartodate ytd noi dscr through september  was x down from x at issuance as mentioned above the decrease in the dscr is a result of free rent for multiple tenants the amount of free rent was approximately  million and was escrowed at issuance according to the servicer had the escrowed rent been included in the analysis the resulting dscr would be x the second largest watchlist loan is the google and amazon office portfolio which is secured by two office properties containing  million square feet located in sunnyvale ca both properties are  leased to google  and amazon  who reportedly just took occupancy the ytd noi dscr through september  was reported at x compared to x at issuance the loan is on the watchlist due to the decline in dscr that is attributable to rent concessions to amazon according to the servicer reserves were distributed for the free rent and if the reserves were included in the dscr calculation the dscr would increase to x rating sensitivities all classes maintain stable outlooks due to the recent issuance of the transaction and stable performance fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings
