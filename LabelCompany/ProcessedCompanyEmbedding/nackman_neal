thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fullyear results with me today on the call are sammy aaron our vice chairman wayne miller our chief operating officer neal nackman our chief financial officer and jeff goldfarb our director of strategic planning fy  was another record year of growth operational success and strategic progress for giii of course as you know warm weather and soft traffic made for a very difficult retail environment in the fourth quarter our fourth quarter sales increased by  to  million versus last years  million this was roughly  million below our forecast the shortfall was entirely related to lower outerwear sales in both our wholesale and retail businesses our adjusted net income per diluted share was  per share compared to  in the fourth quarter last year this was  below the low end of our previous guidance the profit shortfall reflects lower than forecasted wholesale and retail sales in outerwear as well as higher discounting and promotion of outerwear i would like to provide some fullyear highlights we grew fullyear sales by  to a record of  billion we grew our fullyear adjusted ebitda in fy  by  to a record  million similarly our nongaap net income grew by  to a record  million and adjusted eps for the full year grew  to  per share beyond the good annual financial performance we captured a number of important initiatives across multiple categories with powerhouse brands weve dramatically expanded the range and size of our growth opportunity we expect to see positive sales and profit impact from our deals with karl lagerfeld and tommy hilfiger to accelerate into the back half of the year longer term we believe tommy hilfiger and karl lagerfeld represent a  billion annual revenue opportunity for giii were pleased that our consistent execution and great product has continued to reinforce our leadership position in the industry we work hard to be a creative force for our customers and consumers and to be a reliable and trusted partner we made that evident in the context of a tough fourth quarter for retail in general and for outerwear in particular we worked with our customers effectively and collaboratively and ended the season with manageable levels of inventory both for them and for us even so were planning prudently and have a reduced outerwear plan for fy  versus fy  we see strong growth in every other category this coming year and believe it is prudent to protect the expectation of relatively secure diversified growth in sales and operating profit from the kind of seasonal risk weve just experienced the balance of our wholesale business is on a great trajectory following a solid holiday performance to be clear our understanding is that this was not very common this past year our performance in a wide range of categories has continued to set us apart from the pack we think this superior performance gives us good momentum and a competitive advantage for this upcoming year now lets discuss in more detail how each of our businesses are doing this past holiday dress sportswear performance handbag and womens suit businesses all continued to sell through well and our margins remained strong team sports also had an excellent fall and holiday season lets put numbers to each of these businesses in dresses we had net sales of approximately  million this past year we see good opportunity to sustain a doubledigit rate of topline growth in the dress category calvin klein eliza j vince camuto and jessica howard dresses were standout performance this past year for fy  tommy hilfiger dresses has just launched for spring and we expect to quickly establish a strong position for karl lagerfeld dresses as we build our successful launch this past fall and holiday in sportswear and performance we had net sales of about  million in fy  were pleased with these results but at the same time this is the single biggest category in the industry at  million were only at the beginning stage of our long term opportunity so far our success in the sportswear and performance business has primarily been driven by calvin klein were now poised for major growth expansion and diversification across a number of brands including what we see as a tremendous opportunity with both tommy hilfiger and karl lagerfeld we think sportswear and performance is likely to be our largest as well as our fastest growing business handbags has been a great business for us this year in which we achieved approximately  million in net sales here too were in the early days of a long term plan in a very large category thus far our business is essentially all with calvin klein we like the sales opportunity we see in handbags the margins were achieving and the breadth and depth of expansion opportunities this is another key brandbuilding category for our lagerfeld strategy and were pleased to have launched karl lagerfeld handbags this past holiday season were confident that like dresses and sportswear handbags is a strong doubledigit growth business for us womens suits and suit separates was about a  million business for us this past year weve done a good job of leading this category for key department store customers with a range of brands this year we have some really great catalysts to cement our leadership position in the category we will launch tommy hilfiger womens suits in the second half of the year karl lagerfeld womens suits will also be available this august we believe that having three great brands calvin klein tommy and lagerfeld will enable us to further dominate this category again our expectation is sustainable and strong doubledigit growth team sports had a great year led by nfl and the launch of hands high by jimmy fallon this past holiday season we have a great business with expanding rights and again we see strong sustainable growth for us over the next several years there is great excitement in our organization for all these businesses to have the opportunity to create a worldwide resurgence of the karl lagerfeld brand is something special to have the opportunity to help greatly expand an iconic brand like tommy hilfiger in north america is equally powerful theres also tremendous energy around the ongoing turnaround of gh bass a storied authentic american brand more in a moment on gh bass wilsons fourth quarter and fullyear comp sales were disappointing at a negative  and  respectively clearly the warm weather this winter season impacted outerwear sales which is key to the business we also saw softness in our touristdriven outlet locations were looking closely at how we can continue to evolve the business and regain the profitability wilsons had achieved prior to this fiscal year weve realigned our wilsons management organization and recently hired a talented chief merchandising officer were working on reassorting and rebalancing our product mix for the upcoming fall holiday season as well as launching new branding initiatives both in our stores and online gh bass had comp sales increases of  and  in the fourth quarter and full year respectively here too weve taken steps to improve our profitability we have more work to do in our footwear assortment where were now beginning to produce our own shoes we also are working hard to capture what we view as an untapped ecommerce opportunity were also cognizant that beyond our approach of greater store productivity and a stronger online business we have a great brand in gh bass that is not constrained to its own stores gh bass has potential in retail wholesale and licensing both here and abroad we have a great licensing partnership already in place with pvh overland and genesco and were working aggressively on new licensing and wholesale initiatives were also looking closely at some meaningful international distribution partnerships both for wholesale and for retail turning to our vilebrequin business it is fundamentally sound that the brand remains healthy even so our reported results are off from last year our european business has been hit by the macroeconomic and political environment over the past year in addition the stronger us dollar impacted sales in our us stores as international tourism spending declined with regards to what we can control our team is doing a great job with respect to product innovation and this will help the business globally regardless of the environment our real estate portfolio is excellent we still see the same long term opportunity for the brand ill reserve some comments for closing and will now turn the call over to neal for a closer review of our financial performance neal nackman thank you for the full fy  we grew net sales by  to  billion compared to last years net sales of  billion net sales of our wholesale operation segment increased  to  billion from  billion primarily as a result of increased sales of calvin klein products with the largest increases occurring in womens suits handbags dresses and performance wear in addition we had increases in sales of ivanka trump products eliza j dresses and our team sports products and privatelabel programs net sales in our retail operation segment increased  to  million from  million due to an increase in samestore sales of  for gh bass offset in part by a comp decrease of  in wilsons as compared to the same period in the prior year our gross margin percentage was  in both fy  and fy  gross margin percentage in our wholesale operation segment improved to  compared to  in the prior year the gross margin percentage in our retail operation segment was  compared to  in the prior year selling general and administrative expenses increased to  million or  of sales in fy  from  million or  in the prior year this reflects greater cost for personnel facilities and advertising personnel cost increases were attributable to staffing additional retail stores the expansion of certain product lines and for bonus accruals related to increased profitability facility cost increases reflect greater rent expense for additional retail store leases open since the prior year in addition we increased our use of thirdparty shipping facilities to satisfy the higher shipping volume advertising costs were related to the increased net sales of licensed products as well as greater cooperative advertising pursuant to many of our license agreements our effective tax rate was  in the current year compared to  in the prior year the lower rate in the prior year was significantly impacted by certain nonrecurring transactions recorded in other income in the prior year that were not subject to income tax were anticipating a  tax rate in our outlook for fy  net income for the year increased to  million or  per diluted share from  million or  per diluted share in the prior year included in our net income in the current year is approximately  million of other income equal to  per diluted share which primarily consists of the reduction of the estimated contingent consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of vilebrequin the prior years other income was  million or  per diluted share and primarily consisted of three items first payments for the sale of rights to operate calvin klein performance stores in asia including the sale of the companys interest in the joint venture that operated calvin klein performance stores in china second a gain in connection with the reduction of the estimated contingent consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of vilebrequin and lastly a gain with respect to the early extinguishment of debt at a discount constituting a portion of the consideration paid for the acquisition of vilebrequin on an adjusted basis excluding these other income items from the current and prioryears full results nongaap net income per diluted share was  for fy  compared to  for fy  regarding our fourth quarter net sales increased  to  million compared to  million in last years comparable quarter net sales in our wholesale operation segment in the quarter increased  to  million from  million net sales in our retail operation segment are consistent with the prior year at about  million in each period our consolidated gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter was  compared to  in last years fourth quarter the gross margin percentage for our wholesale operation segment was  in the fourth quarter compared to  in the prior years quarter gross margin percentage for our retail operation segment was  compared to  in the previous years quarter that was due to increased promotional activity in that segment sga expenses increased  million to  of net sales from  we have increases in payroll costs inthird party shipping advertising and design expenses all of which support our overall growth sga increases were impacted by new initiatives related to our launch of karl lagerfeld products tommy hilfiger dresses and gh bass wholesale initiatives our net income for the quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to  million or  per diluted share in last years fourth quarter regarding our balance sheet accounts receivable at fiscal yearend increased  to  million from  million at the end of the prior year our inventory at year end increased approximately  to  million from  million last year this is about  percentage points above our forecasted first quarter sales this increment is attributable to excess outerwear which were holding for this coming fall while this ties up some working capital we do not expect a negative impact on our margin in the upcoming season in fy  we spent approximately  million on capital expenditures primarily for fixturing in key department store doors as well as leasehold improvements for new and remodeled wilsons gh bass and vilebrequin stores we also invested approximately  million for a  ownership in karl lagerfeld north america at the end of the year we had no outstanding debt and cash on hand of  million compared to a prior year cash on hand balance of  million regarding guidance for the fiscal year ending january   were forecasting net sales to increase approximately  to approximately  billion compared to  billion in fy  we expect net income to increase between  million and  million or between  and  per diluted share as compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share and  per diluted share on a nongaap adjusted basis were assuming a fully diluted share count of approximately  million shares were forecasting fy  adjusted ebitda to grow between  and  to a range of approximately  million to  million from  million in fy  with regard to the first quarter ending april   were forecasting net sales of approximately  million compared to  million in last years first fiscal quarter we also are forecasting net income between  million and  million or between zero and  per diluted share compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share in last years first fiscal quarter the first quarter will also be impacted by additional expenses related to our new initiatives the sales impact from these new initiatives will accelerate in the latter half of the upcoming year that concludes my comments and i will now turn the call back to morris for closing remarks morris goldfarb thank you neal the fourth quarter aside our fy  was powerful both in terms of our financial performance and more importantly our strategic development over the past several years we certainly have been very fortunate to have found such a powerful partner with the calvin klein organization and pvh calvin klein is a truly powerful iconic global brand we view the opportunity now immediately in front of us with the tommy hilfiger and karl lagerfeld relationships in the same way these are also great iconic brands with tremendous potential i think its worth repeating that we have mapped out roughly  billion in annual revenue opportunity for giii from just these two brands and while im focusing on them given they are recent and have scale we also have great opportunities in every category across many brands in our diversified mix of businesses as we begin the new fiscal year a major challenge continues to simply rise to the goals and the high standards that weve set for ourselves we just finished a year where we drove decisively forward through one of the toughest outerwear seasons ever through one of the most challenging macro environments ever and yet we managed to post record results at the same time we also created the biggest set of future opportunities weve ever seen were confident that these opportunities will propel us to new record levels of sales and profits for many years to come thank you operator were now ready for some questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from ed yruma from keybanc capital markets please go ahead jessica schmidt this is jessica schmidt on for ed thanks for taking my question just first you talked about it a little bit but if you could just elaborate on inventories in the channel for outerwear and then i know you typically try to avoid doing some packaways but you did that for this upcoming fall can you just add some color on what some of your partners are doing in terms of packaway and then my second question just in terms of just given the severity of the miss is there any reason why you didnt necessarily preannounce at icr is this an indication that maybe trends  last a few weeks in the quarter thanks morris goldfarb our inventory levels are a little higher than normal we made a strategic decision to hold back some of the offprice sales that we historically do at this time of the year the rationale for that there were opportunities more opportunities than ever for the offprice channel to consume the leftover inventories or the troubled inventories in our sector so seeing that we decided that we would dispose of our fashionrisk inventory and hold onto our core basics because we believe that we can appropriately reassort them for the coming year and generate more value for them than we could have in a highdensity disposable area of business so we opted to hold onto our inventory the packaway segment of what we talk about today i would assume is quite deep and part of the rationale for what we believe is a fair analysis of what we might expect in the coming year is the knowledge that there is a fair amount of packaway product being held by our offprice retailers so we take that into consideration and we temper the growth of our business with that knowledge as far as the preannounce segment of the business weve had internal discussions as to the benefit of preannounce to our shareholders and to ourselves and inasmuch as were more of a wholesale business than a retail business it is a moving target we do not have visibility the same as a retailer does we do not know immediately the effect of inventory that the department stores hold on us so we wait we wait until we solve our problems with call it vendor assistance returns product that we have to solve for the retailer so that comes a little bit later the decision was made that we felt that we were best for the shareholder and for ourselves to announce as we do normally we view our business as very healthy we have all these great opportunities we believe that it was well understood that the weather that we had to deal with was well understood in all our conversations we alluded to how difficult the coat business was and how the weather impacted us thank you jessica operator our next question comes from erinn murphy from piper jaffray please go ahead erinn murphy just a couple of questions for you guys first just following up on jessicas question as you think forward into fall of  given what youre seeing with packaway and how youre seeing inventory in the channel are you still comfortable at the wholesale level indiscernible department store level with the flattish order book and is it really the offprice thats causing a little bit more concern just help us think about how you see the order book panning out right now for fall of  for outerwear morris goldfarb were forecasting our business as a conservative one going forward were comping the weather patterns that we just went through and i dont believe were going to have the same situation to deal with so there is upside to our plan were not incurring too much of an issue on the department store level the size of the department may decrease to some degree but our percentage of the pie as always is increasing in troubled times the retailer leans on their best resources the resources that protected them in a tough environment and the resources that sold best in a tough environment and we qualify for both of those so i would say that our business is fairly projected for the year id be disappointed if we merely hit the projection that were putting out on the coat side erinn murphy and this is probably more for neal but it sounds like you guys started adding some costs for the new businesses the tommy hilfiger dress business the karl lagerfeld businesses that started it seems like some of those charges started in the fourth quarter could you just help us think about the trajectory of some of these added expenses what was the impact specifically to the fourth quarter and how do you see that first half versus second half of this year if theres any way to break out the incremental expenses related to how youre fueling the growth neal nackman yes erinn we did start to incur expenses the karl lagerfeld business was launched in the third quarter we actually were building expenses although small in the earlier part of this year it certainly continued in q it continued in q we did not have a significant amount of sales in either one of those quarters but a small impact really overall to the deleverage for the current year as you move into next year were really starting to build all the new tommy hilfiger businesses thats going to be dependent upon how quickly we hire people some of those people have been hired already there will be more people hired for the karl lagerfeld initiatives there will also be a marketing spend relative to our gh bass business there will be more space that were going to need to incur so those things will continue to ramp up as we go through as far as the expense side as we go through fiscal yearend  of course the good news is that as the year progresses were in the karl lagerfeld business were shipping throughout the year tommy will start to ship more with strength in the latter part of the year karl will also probably accelerate so i think next year well be under pressure in terms of again levering sga at the wholesale side of the business but we do expect that come the end of next year we should be well aligned and then going forward to start to see more positive operating performance from the new initiatives erinn murphy okay and then two clarifications neal first is the tommy hilfiger business excluding the dress business the piece that you just picked up from pvh is that actually accretive this year in total neal nackman the tommy hilfiger dress business for this year would have been slightly accretive with all the businesses that we run when we start businesses weve been very very good at always having them accretive the issue is that theyre not at the same operating margin percentage as we would expect the overall erinn murphy and then sorry the other tommy hilfiger business the suiting denim sportswear the most recent licenses is that still accretive just not as accretive as if it was fully scaled neal nackman yes thats our anticipation for next fy thats right erinn murphy okay and then just last neal for you if we were to take the midpoint of your guidance call it from an eps perspective the  what are your expectations for gross margin and sga within that neal nackman just in total erinn were looking at a year thats going to be on the gross margin side were looking for pickup really in the retail side of the business the wholesale business margins have been good we expect that those will continue at relatively the same rates as they were for this year as i mentioned were expecting some sga pressure so well probably have a little bit of pressure on operating margin performance in general for that entire business as i said the retail businesses were looking for much more seasonal weather as far as wilsons is concerned that should help our margins and still continued increases on the gh bass business as well operator our next question comes from eric beder from wunderlich please go ahead eric beder youve talked before about how outerwear is about  of your business i think was the comment you made last year what should we be thinking about going forward is going to be the percentage of business with outerwear and when you look at karl and tommy how are you going to a karl what is going to be the distribution strategy initially and for tommy how are you going to expand that beyond its core at macys here in the us morris goldfarb the first question relative to the size of our outerwear business were just shy of  outerwear but if you look at wilsons wilsons alone is about  outerwear so where the serious impact in retail really exists for us is wilsons so just maneuvering through a business thats faced with outlet stores the premier outlet stores that we have that are in tourist centers that are dependent on foreign tourism that was off dramatically as well as the worst weather that i can ever remember i would say that were not likely to anniversary that with wilsons were changing our product mix to a degree we had some deficiencies in fashion not critical to the business but we believe we can alter the assortment and make it better than it has been were altering the levels of inventory that we have the sign on the door says wilsons leather leather is evaporated to a small percentage of what we do leather being the highest ticket in the store we were negatively impacted by that so were making the appropriate adjustments for wilsons and we include wilsons as part of that  coats on the wholesale side we really dont see a major issue in being the dominant supplier of outerwear were clearly the dominant supplier in the department store sector for both mens and womens in tough times as i said before the vendor base does change and we derive the benefits for that we provide great margin for the department stores they clearly dont want to give up the type of margin that they get on the outerwear side its the best that we provide for the retailer in any classification so theres a desire to grow it not to shrink it and were there for long term in outerwear as a matter of fact were adding another brand to it were adding karl lagerfeld as an outerwear brand this year so we dont have a fear of the outerwear business and your second question the distribution of karl and tommy are a little bit different karl the initial distribution is to lord  taylor and to dillards and several specialty stores its a breadth of product weve shipped footwear for the first time the footwear is retailing very well were pleased weve gotten decent distribution for lord  taylor we clearly are obvious on the footwear floor and were retailing exceptionally well the dillards to a lesser degree has distribution and those shoes are selling well also weve made a couple of fashion faux pas on our early distribution as we always do thats not a problem for us weve adjusted some of the retails to clear some of the inventory at retail for lagerfeld second delivery is much better and we believe that our third delivery is exceptional i encourage you to shop the store shop lord  taylor and dillards and see what the product looks like were proud of it as always weve got bestinclass associates that have joined our company to help grow it this being a troubled time for a lot of brands has given us the opportunity to get the best talent in the industry to spearhead all the initiatives that were going forward with tommy has got two issues one is the exclusive distribution to macys is ours to deal with in fy  we basically take over at the beginning of next year for the sportswear piece that services only macys all the other classifications and they are coats dresses suit separates denim all the other and performance apparel all those classifications are basically open to distribute its basically the same distribution as calvin klein its department stores its a level of offprice its a level of club business and its a large initiative its not often that youre able to sign a license and not make an acquisition not go outofpocket not affect your balance sheet and feel comfortable within three years you have  billion worth of business that you can generate and thats a fair number part of it comes through the guarantee from macys and the other pieces come from the knowledge that we have and the capabilities we have in building product shipping product and having great retail partners that are supporting the real estate that we need to make us feel comfortable that that numbers a realistic number operator our next question comes from rick patel from stephens please go ahead rick patel can you just delve a little deeper into your outlook as we think about your first quarter earnings guide for lower yearoveryear earnings growth are you being hit by continued mark downs in the new quarter or is it just a function of higher expenses thats the primary culprit there and to what extent is there an element of conservatism in those numbers neal nackman just on the first quarter really let me start in order of magnitude in terms of pl were probably most impacted in the first quarter with the incremental spend on our new initiatives i mentioned the categories before thats probably in terms of magnitude the greatest impact on our first quarter so well definitely see sga pressure were building those businesses and the sales are still nowhere near normal or where we expect them to be the second issue really is an impact of reduced gross margin percentages were still finding in our wilsons business has still continued to never have seasonal weather for the entire season thats impacted them theyve continued to move out of inventory theres also a drag to some extent on the gh bass business as that has impacted traffic as well so certainly some pressure on the retail side of the business in the first quarter much less of an impact in terms of mark downs just to be very clear when we end a season we accrue for all the mark downs as far as the items that weve shipped so weve had all our conversations weve cleaned up all of our inventory and our positions through the end of the year and we essentially go into the first quarter based upon how we perform at retail other than the general reality that retail is impacted coming off of a very weak fourth quarter and things have not really picked up extremely well we continue to see our brands performing at the best within categories but well see some pressure on the wholesale that will not be a function of catching up to prior mark downs its really more a function of what we see going on in the marketplace today so just to recap that for you a little bit gross margin pressure mostly on the outlet side of our business some of the wholesale side of our business certainly sga pressure from a leverage standpoint with respect to the new initiatives and since im giving you color on the first quarter i might as well lead a little bit into the second quarter as well the one thing that we do continue to see in the second quarter well continue to see that expense pressure hopefully by that point in time our retail business will start to normalize margins but we will have sga pressure into the second quarter we also think that well have to some extent the outerwear season is certainly one that is more challenged as we go into this year and the second quarter is the start of our outerwear shipping so we do see a little bit of pressure on the topline sales in terms of the ability to get that early outerwear out as early as weve done in the past there may be more of a focus on taking that outerwear closer to what will hopefully be seasonal weather next year for us so thats the additional guidance id be willing to give you at this point on the quarters rick patel and can you also just revisit your long term growth algorithm based on the guidance for  looking for mid to high singledigit eps growth has your thinking changed about the longer term potential for the company morris goldfarb the potential for the company has never been better i think weve cited three huge opportunities the opportunities we have between bass karl lagerfeld tommy hilfiger and the organic growth thats still achievable and that we still factor into our businesses can double the size of our business its an amazing spot that were in were explaining the situations of the past and the futures never looked better we have assets that are deliverable assets we have talent in place that can make it happen we have capital that can support the growth of the business we have no long term debt so i would tell you the prognosis for the future has never in my career been better than where we sit today rick patel and morris can you give us more color on the opportunity for hilfiger i know in the past youve mentioned that lagerfeld could be a  million opportunity so as we think about the  billion that would apply to hilfiger how do you see that breaking out across all the different categories that youve lined up morris goldfarb its difficult for me to break it out by category but all i can tell you is it took us a decade to assume all the rights that we have with calvin klein and with tommy hilfiger it took us two weeks to negotiate through a contract and we have what took us  years to amass with calvin klein and we have an amazing partner that is aligned with us in the desire to grow the brand steve shiffman who leads the charge has been an amazing partner cooperating at every level we believe that its a reasonable bet that we can achieve what weve achieved through calvin klein with steve shiffman we can achieve with gary sheinbaum in tommy hilfiger gary has worked with sammy aaron in carving out the essential elements of the business that can help us grow rapidly were on our way today the only thing we lack right now is a showroom that can properly house it the product got here before the showroom did and theres excitement in the industry for what were showing and what were beginning to deliver im comfortable that the numbers are realistic operator our next question comes from john kernan from cowen please go ahead john kernan i just wanted to go back to the first quarter again there is a pretty big acceleration in the yearoveryear growth in terms of sales i guess youre implying that things are looking better in certain categories can you walk us through whats gotten better since the end of the fourth quarter outside of outerwear neal nackman john really i would tell you that the outerwear story continues the only negative that were really looking at has been the outerwear story that continues slightly into the first quarter our nonouterwear businesses have been growing at either high single digits or doubledigit growth weve done well in dresses sportswear in suits and handbags and that continues into the first quarter as well john kernan okay and then just looking beyond the first quarter and this year the  billion in revenues that youve talked about the incremental revenues from hilfiger and lagerfeld can you talk about the expenses that are going to go into supporting that but also the long term goal of doubledigit operating margin that you spoke of in the past how far out does that get pushed now that there are expenses in building these two new businesses neal nackman i would tell you look ultimately when we build all these businesses out there will be probably at around the same operating margins that we experienced today for our wholesale business which is now really a doubledigit operating margin performance on the wholesale side of our business and ultimately the businesses that were adding will be in about that same operating margin zone the big issue for us in terms of getting to a consolidated doubledigit operating margin is improving the retail side of the business this is really the first time at the end of this year that well actually have incurred a loss or first time in over a handful of years that weve had a loss from that segment of the business while its small thats unusual for us we see no reason why that business cant get righted both the wilsons business returning back to where it had been and still improving just to remind you the wilsons business had really been a high singledigit operating margin business for several years prior to the rough patch of weather and now of course this year weather and tourism we see no reason fundamentally why that wont get back to high single digits and then ultimately be a doubledigit operating margin business gh bass has been a loser since weve taken it on from an operating margin standpoint weve significantly improved that loss this past year were expecting small profitability out of it as we go into next year and we continue to think that thats a doubledigit operating margin business for us so in total for us to get to the doubledigit operating margin that weve been talking about it really will be reliant on us improving the retail business and moving that from really what were now looking at is in the forecast a low singledigit operating margin up to the doubledigit operating margin level john kernan and then two quick housekeeping questions just going back to a prior question the percentage of your business that is outerwear in the fourth quarter did you give that neal nackman we didnt but it runs fourth quarter tends to be comparable to what we run for the whole year which is around  at wholesale of course much more impacted by the wilsons business is more significantly impacted in the fourth quarter where that would be slightly higher john kernan okay and then one final question it looks like theres working capital tied up in the business right now with the inventory elevated can you help us understand what cash flow free cash flow looks like in your fy  neal nackman sure without a doubt the slowdown in terms of retail selling weve got more inventory that we would have expected to have converted into receivables and then cash going into this year we were probably averaging about  million a year of free cash flow this last year we were probably down at around  million if you added back the investment that weve got in karl lagerfeld we were expecting to be probably closer to about  million of free cash flow this past year i think the slowdown in terms of our business forced us to tie up more of our free cash flow and working capital so i think youre right about that observation i think going forward well return to some nice healthy increases in free cash flow going forward should certainly be at that  million level or better going forward before we get into investments operator our next question comes from david glick from buckingham research please go ahead david glick neal just a clarification on your guidance that was very helpful on q and q on a consolidated basis for the fy where are you planning gross margins relative to last year and are you planning sga deleverage is my first question i have some followups neal nackman just to be clear again for the full year were anticipating increasing gross margin percentage and that will be offset by increasing sga deleverage and if you looked at our guidance and you rolled it out youll see were looking at a pretty flat year in terms of an operating margin percentage david glick and then from a sales perspective i just want to clarify where are you planning your wholesale outerwear business where are you planning your bass business from a topline perspective so that implies obviously probably a doubledigit nonouterwear business but im just wondering if you could break that out for us neal nackman were planning the outerwear business as morris said that it will be negative midsingle levels at this point the bass business were expecting essentially almost to anniversary the increasing comps we had this year we had a comp increase this year of about  were expecting that same type of increase on bass again next year just to give you a little more color even on the wilsons side where we were about negative  this year were expecting about high singledigit comps for next year on wilsons morris goldfarb david just to get back to bass for a minute bass isnt exclusively a retail play its a licensing model its wholesale for us both in coats as well as womens sportswear so there are elements of bass that are working better than retail for the moment as we get the retail aligned as we make some adjustments in the way we promote the way the store looks and the levels of inventory necessary to run the bass stores we have segments of the business that are working well the licensing piece is working extremely well david glick one last followup morris for you if i could you issued equity a few years ago now youve generated a lot of sales growth opportunities as you described without making a major acquisition given where the stock is trading at the moment you have a share repurchase authorization would you consider putting your net cash position to work to buy back stock at this point morris goldfarb we might our board has given us the right to repurchase  million shares were reviewing it all now and were going to do the prudent thing for ourselves and for the investment community if we view it as the best use of our capital we will absolutely buy back stock operator our next question comes from liz pierce from brean capital please go ahead liz pierce just a couple clarifications on the wilsons when you talked about comp thats a positive high single digit right neal nackman yes liz pierce okay and then in terms of also on the packaway i just want to make sure i understood what you said on the outerwear you packed away the core basic problem and moved the more fashion off into the offprice channel morris goldfarb yes we either promoted the fashion through the department store sector or sold the fashion elements off to the offprice channel liz pierce and thats just basically because you believe you can still sell right theres a longer shelf life theoretically if weather normalizes morris goldfarb absolutely liz pierce for the stuff that you packed away morris goldfarb the stuff that we packed away and didnt aggressively push through the retail venues that were there we believe that we can benefit long term by reassorting it then reshipping it for fall of  liz pierce okay so just feeling that it doesnt have as much risk just more shelf life and then in terms of wilsons you talked about the change of mix this is also largely an outerwear question given how difficult it is to predict the weather and consumers continuing to buy closer to need are you rethinking how you do outerwear on a larger scale like more layering pieces less heavyweight really changing that mix up morris goldfarb yes absolutely what were doing is creating either systems jackets that have the ability of taking off a layer and wearing an inner layer were producing transitional weight garments so the assortment is changing as the consumer needs and consumer taste levels change a lot of our outerwear can be worn in mild environments versus all the heavyweights that we had done historically liz pierce and then my final question just on jimmy fallon i think you had mentioned at icr that you had recently signed up more universities so two questions are you continuing to build that book of business not only in number of schools but across maybe other categories morris goldfarb yes very much so the number of schools that weve signed on are north of  important colleges and universities and the initiatives that were looking at dont necessarily have to have the application of team sports or colleges the concept of logo placements can work for premium product they can work for pedestrian just wearable apparel so were looking at all opportunities with jimmy fallon weve got a big launch thats planned for major league baseball and we have an ongoing situation with nfl operator operator instructions and our next question comes from jim duffy from stifel please go ahead jim duffy neal can you size the expected revenue contribution from the new tommy licenses and lagerfeld in fy  and then morris i have some bigger picture questions on strategy neal nackman jim its too early for us to do that weve been on sale for parts of the year we havent decided not to size that just yet jim duffy okay morris questions for you you have a lot going on in the portfolio do you see any opportunities for active portfolio management maybe exiting some businesses which are less strategic such that you can prioritize resources to others that have more attractive returns is that part of the thought process morris goldfarb we have done some of that weve exited some of the smaller businesses that are space intensive people intensive and really at the level that were at and the sights that weve set for ourselves dont rationalize in our business any longer there have probably been a half a dozen of those that have been eliminated things like sean john and jones new york to a major degree nine west the dress business at andrew marc there are a lot of elements that make up the portfolio of brands and businesses within giii and weve exited them were under review with several other pieces of business some that are mildly profitable and some that contribute to the reduction of our corporate overhead and some that dont will go away jim duffy and then a question for you just on the retail footprint given the challenges weve seen distort traffic of late do you view that as a transient phenomenon and what are your thoughts on allocation of capital towards owned retail on a goforward basis morris goldfarb im not aggressive on opening new stores currently were committed to several leases for this year for wilsons we have five new stores opening this year whereas last year we had about  so weve tempered the growth until we figure out what the consumer is all about were a little confused we dont know if theres long term instability on outlet centers such as orlando las vegas woodbury commons sawgrass these are premium centers for us premium in the sense that they provide the biggest share of our revenue and as i said earlier the traffic is down dramatically when youre down in your top stores its very hard to redeem it in your local centers so were reviewing what we do with retail we have three different models they all have different dynamics were finding some wonderful opportunities in vilebrequin we just opened three new locations in germany those locations werent available to us in the past the locations of vilebrequin are very small the capex in these locations is very small as well and they fit into the long term plan of the business we have an unblemished brand thats careful on how we open stores and we will continue to open those we flipped a little bit two years ago the strategy was to open more american stores and less european stores today we flipped it europe is doing better than the states and we have opportunities that we never had in stores the third model is the bass model and thats a little interesting i encourage you to walk into a bass today if you were in a bass store a year ago youd see a dramatic difference in how the product is presented the quality of the product the promotions that are being run throughout the store and i will tell you that were opening an outlet store in manchester vermont and another one a refit in woodbury commons in late april the woodbury commons will show you what the future of bass might look like the stores a little bit smaller it will be much more intensive on the footwear side of the business and we believe that we have a gem in our hands that just needs a little bit more love before it gives us the earnings stream that we think is still attainable operator and our last question comes from erinn murphy from piper jaffray please go ahead erinn murphy just two clarifications first on the outerwear order book i thought earlier in the call you mentioned that it was trending flattish at department stores but that was being somewhat offset by more of a cautious offprice outlook i think neal towards the end of the call said it was actually down midsingle digits is that accurate and thats all in thats my first clarification neal nackman what im referring to is the full year going forward and the order book really is soft at this point relative to where weve been in the past and i think thats retailers really also still trying to figure out and adjust to what their formal plans will be for outerwear next year erinn murphy what percent of your order book is completed at this point versus whats normal this time of year neal nackman were generally around  complete for the year in total all categories and were slightly below where we were last year erinn murphy okay so then if youre slightly below where you were last year with about  done to get to your negative mid single digit allin youre assuming that things dont meaning things actually get worse just to clarify whats in your guide neal nackman no its too early to do that math i think erinn were still anticipating lots of orders to come in on both categories so were not anticipating any future degradation to that book erinn murphy okay and then just a second clarification just on the comp outlook for wilsons i think you said high singledigit positive comp with the year that we just had what gives you confidence in this trend and is that something that youre seeing already quarter to date in the first quarter neal nackman were not seeing it yet were really still experiencing unseasonable weather and actively promoting to move goods where that makes sense what gives us confidence at this point is that we really think that this is a very unusual weather pattern that we experienced for this past year if you look at the previous few years of wilsons performance the performances was much better and we dont see anything fundamentally wrong with our box and our model of whats going on at wilsons we think that in terms of bounce back we think we will get a bounce back on weather in terms of tourism not sure that that bounces back quite as quickly or as robustly morris goldfarb erinn in a followup to neals answer on our order book when you have elements of our business that are bought theyre not seasonal there are multiple buys as we build a dress business that delivers many times a year as we build a sportswear business that delivers many times a year as we build a footwear business those orders come in by collection versus the coat business where your orders are in early there is an element that you can refer to that includes just the coat business but what weve just done is weve put online tommy hilfiger weve put online karl lagerfeld we’ve bass sportswear all these orders are not in theyre not in early theyre bought relative to a collection so the anticipation is that relative to our plan the percentage of our order book would be less thats the rationale
