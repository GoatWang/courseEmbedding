objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

the ability for insureds to receive up to  of their policy’s value upfront if diagnosed with a terminal illness additionally policyholders can convert a term policy to universal life at any period before the term ends as long as it’s before the policyholder’s th birthday several permanent life insurance policies are available depending on your needs the classic universal life policy has a guaranteed death benefit as long as regular premium payments are made these policies have a cash value that can be borrowed against but loans must be fully repaid for the full value of the policy to be distributed as a death benefit the “symetra sulg survivorship” plan is similar to regular universal life but it’s engineered specifically to act as an estate planning tool with optional riders for charitable giving and estate preservation for added flexibility in planning “symetra successor single premium” is exactly that a plan with a single premium you deposit a significant amount of money
