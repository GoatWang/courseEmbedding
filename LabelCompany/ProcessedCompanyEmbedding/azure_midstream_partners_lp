president dont show again next timeenter site as someone whos built a career in the natural gas business by consistently delivering success the events related to azures public company azure midstream partners amp were extremely challenging educational and profoundly disappointing for me eighteen months ago when crude and natural gas prices plunged and drilling activity declined to the lowest levels in recent decades some of amps gas volumes declined and our biggest customercounterparty defaulted on a contract the combination of these events caused amp to fall out of compliance with the terms of its bank covenants during  we sought and were granted a series of waivers from the banks to work through possibilities to fix the mlp the declining business environment and an onerous debt level limited our options with our bank group in parallel with this bank waiver process the azure management team tackled a multipronged strategic initiative to dramatically reduce costs restructure nonperforming contracts and raise capital through the sale of key nonessential assets this dramatically improved the balance sheet and streamlined operations in  alone we reduced our debt by  million from  million to  million while azures commercial team continued to capture new business despite the challenging environment unfortunately our progress failed to convince the lenders to continue taking reasonable steps forward with us and they indicated they would not continue to provide waivers this decision forced the board and management team to file chapter  on january   our goal in this action was to preserve and maximize value for all stakeholders after an auction process amps assets sold to enterprise for  million an increase of  million over the  million stalking horse bid closing this sale of the amp assets provided a complete recovery of the debt proceeds for our bank group and allowed for the confirmation of our bankruptcy plan on june nd  the estate will be wound down by a transition team over the next few months led by roy bertolatus and supported by our private company azure midstream energy llc while we appreciate the expertise and professionalism of our bankruptcy lawyers and advisors the process did cost the company approximately  million our focus and hope in this wind down is to recover all amounts owed to our creditors quickly settle all proofs of claim as approved by the court and obtain some value for our unitholders for losses sustained by amp unit holders i am personally sorry sometimes in business an unexpected current can wash you far from your intended destination in many ways amp was caught up by larger forces – including historically low energy prices and opecs strategy to weaken americas energy industry we make no excuses but we do hope that all stakeholders recognize that the azure management team and employees worked assiduously through extreme conditions to significantly improve the business value and trajectory as a year veteran of the natural gas industry i have been privileged to work with many outstanding professionals however the fortitude grit determination and sheer strength of will i witnessed by our cfo mandy bush and the entire senior management team working through  years of forbearances and chapter  all while running the business and marketing its assets was humbling if as they say character is forged in fire we have a team brimming with character and one that is battletested the lessons learned by the azure management team over the past year are now embedded in everything we do running azures private company azure midstream energy we incorporated new ways of streamlining operations and cost cutting while maintaining industryleading safety azure won the gpa midstream safety award last year for the third year in a row we understand what it takes to fight for and win commercial opportunities in the most competitive circumstances and we have a more highlytrained drive to continually improve our balance sheet through innovative initiatives azure midstream energy is on track for  million in ebitda this year and the future looks encouraging particularly given the april  report by the united state geological survey usgs that the oilgas resources contained within the bossier  haynesville formations are more than three times the estimate contained in their  report the increase in drilling rig activity in the region from  rigs in november  to  rigs in june  is another indication that the basin is becoming economically attractive azures system is in the middle of both the haynesville and cotton valley formations and we are well positioned to take advantage of this very positive news we look forward to a bright future with you   lj chip berthelot ii president azure midstream energy

and operating results for the three months ending december    azure had a net loss of  million for the quarter the president and ceo ij berthelot said “we continue to work our way through the financial challenges presented by this unprecedented extreme swing in the commodity pricing pendulum while executing consistently on all other aspects of our business our relentless focus is on doing everything possible to enhance corporate value for our unitholders” azure’s fourth quarter  recurring operating expenses were  million recurring general and administrative expenses were  million depreciation and amortization expenses were  million and interest expense was  million in summary azure midstream partners azur states that the decline in oil and natural gas prices during  and into  has had a significant adverse impact on their business and has impacted azure’s ability to comply with its credit agreement  they feel that is unlikely they will be able to comply with the leverage covenant currently contained in the credit agreement during the next twelve months  based upon their current estimates for commodity prices in  they do not expect to remain in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants contained in their credit agreement throughout  unless those requirements are waived or amended without those waivers or amendments failure to meet these covenants and ratios would result in a default and an acceleration of the existing indebtedness causing their debt of approximately  million to be immediately due and payable  these conditions raise doubt about azure’s
