gryphon audio designs dynaudio bang  olufsen   the best of high end   products of the year  and my favorite album of the year print email details written by doug schneider doug schneider category monthly column monthly column created  january   january  i’m not foolish enough to think that if i wrote an article focusing only on my favorite music releases of  many people would read it what audiophiles want from their hifi magazines print or online are articles about gear gear and more gear  which means that music reviews or articles no matter how well written are often passed by so to give my pick for best album of  as much exposure as possible i’m putting it right at the top of this annual article about the winners of our product of the year awards adam cohen’s we go home was released in midseptember joe taylor reviewed it on soundstage access and gave it higher marks for enjoyment than he did leonard cohen’s popular problems released one week later adam is leonard’s son according to a youtube video produced by adam cohen he had every intention of following up his very successful  release like a man quickly and easily in the studio but when he finished the recording he realized he’d “missed the mark” he scrapped what he’d done and retreated with his band to his childhood homes in greece and canada where he recorded what became we go home i’m glad he did  the  songs have resonated powerfully with me since the first time i heard them cohen and his group sing and play mostly acoustic instruments with such passion and feeling that the result feels almost like a live recording and despite sounding more like folk than rock or pop most of these songs have hooks that grab and don’t let go  i can’t count the number of times i’ve found myself singing in my head a song from we go home the last album that clicked this well for me was tracy chapman’s selftitled debut  and that was in  on his second time around with these songs cohen hit the mark  i like every tune on we go home  but for me the knockouts are “song of me and you” “we go home” “i swear i was there” and the strikingly simple “boats” each alone is worth the album’s price i recommend cd or lp for best sound but if you’re ok with lorez recordings from itunes you’ll get two additional tracks those physical formats don’t include “sun” and “don’t crack” i avoid anything of less than cd quality so i haven’t bought the downloads i’m hoping they’ll make it onto a future “special edition” cd or lp soundstage’s  product of the year awards for the first three categories  pioneering design

guitar review posted on april   by jim of vivid peace the gibson miii radical reissue reinvented electric guitar review one of the staples of recording electric guitar is to have an array of guitars that can make many different sounds without having to unplug and get a different instrument to do it the miii is just such a guitar – a tone machine i like being able to sit down with it and a set of ideas crank up the tubes and the recording world and get down to business while the mood and inspiration are hot my miii fits the bill nicely i recommend one if you’d like a great neck and versatile sound coupled with the rocksolid tuning stability of a doublelocking floyd roseequipped guitar quick opinion i have been looking forward to writing this review there’s a lot to say one of the first things that struck me when i unboxed my miii for the first time was the cool finish it is very much like the oldcarmetallicpoly yes it’s lacquer i’m speaking of ‘look’ appearance of my gibson elliot easton tiki bird firebird… mine is a radiant orange color with the look of the grain under a clear coat it looks deep it’s much cooler than other metallic finishes i’ve seen my orange glow gibson miii plays easily sounds fantastic and is a pleasure to hold whether sitting or standing it sounds great it feels good like an explorer’s neck on a doublecutaway body with stayintunethewholeday kind of playability nice i think if you’re looking for a shreddy guitar a quickplaying intuning whammying guitar and want a set neck with a maple fretboard this is the choice more details read on for more… there are customer reviews and more specs for the miii available here at zzounds features the gibson miii is very featurerich with a ton of great specs  nice doublecutaway mahogany body  excellent maple neck with maple fretboard with a profile something like an explorer with a reversed “explorer banana” headstock   degree radius on the fretboard – very comfortable and natural in the hands for bends   fret heaven – hit that ultrahigh e with ease  a floyd rose bridge and locking nut combination – if only most static bridges had the fine tuners gibson what about making the tp available on production guitars  tone and volume knob simplicity i can reach the volume with my pinky and do volume swells with ease  the master tone pops up to split the humbuckers into singles  hsh pickups with a way selector  a wonderful highgloss smooth finish that colors the body and the back of the neck and headstock  goldsilkscreened gibson logo on the headstock  those awesome oldschool upsidedown black fret marker inlays yeah the pickup selector is a traditional bladetype switch with the following configuration from neckside to bridgeside  neck only  neck and middle  middle only  middle and bridge  bridge only overall this guitar is loaded with lots of stuff buttons switches and downright coolness builtin i think its gutsy of gibson to have some fun with a maplefretboarded toneripper when you combine the poppedup splitting knob with the blade selector you can get loads of different sounds and strengths from these very versatile electronics i am not only an affiliate of zzounds i’m a major fan and customer i really like their zzounds guarantee “ days to try out your dream guitar” playability my miii is a dream to play i already love firebirds and explorers – and the neck is pretty similar in most ways to both… it was like a fun fireexplorersg with maple and a floyd… nice i am agnostic as to necks when it comes to the “perfect” neck for me i love flat necks fat necks medium necks even the flatwide neck of a classical – so i’m almost always comfortable when i pick up a qualitymade gibson of any kind given that i love my zshapes and my banana headstocks i must say that the miii felt right at home despite its funky thumbbassybody look the fretboard has an interesting feel to it it’s not glossy like some of the fender maple necks – rather it is almost “flat” or satin you can get your pure nickel ernie ball “rock and roll” strings out and get everything nice and gray from the nickel on your fingers the neck does have some kind of finish on it much like the raw power sg and les pauls a few years back so the black stuff doesn’t become permanent – but it looks cool when it’s been played quite a bit i have found that using the floyd with the last two fingers of my picking hand and then sliding down to pinky the volume is actually fairly easy for those who do this type of thing even though i’ve gone to using a morley steve vai alligator volume pedal i do still love the fineness of a slick volume control knob’s sweep these are quick and easy because of the metal black knurled knobs generally i carefully swap out my gibson witchhat knobs for this very reason to either knurled or speed knobs – but the miii already has it covered it’s not too heavy on the shoulder or the leg and it has a nice general balance to it – the neck sits out a good ways but the body is bigger and thicker than something like the sg so it’s not too much of a diver at all i am not only an affiliate of zzounds i’m a major fan and customer i really like their zzounds guarantee “ days to try out your dream guitar” sound here is one of the gibson limited edition miii’s strong points sound gibson has brought back the very cool dirty fingers humbucker with a vengeance it’s as crunchy and broad as the original with that nice ability to clean up pretty well when you pick softly and dig in a little less very nice… the humbucker single humbucker configuration combined with the way blade pickup selector and the coilsplitting tone knob you get lots of different sounds out of this beast i have found that the nicelysized body gives excellent sustain while not being too heavy although you don’t get solidbody les paul sustainforweeks sound you do get much better longlasting sustain than with the traditional boltonneckfloyd guitars i think the locking floyd system is a great strong suit to this guitar’s arsenal it stays in tune daytoday for me and i like that i’ve had great guitars with whammys with which i loved recording – but had to stop and tune them over and over again between takes because of their trem systems this miii has that beat and then some if you purchase a new gibson at zzounds qualified buyers can even play as they play with the  month select brands new guitars only payment plan fit and finish my miii is extremely well made the finish is bright smooth and doesn’t have lots of flaws around the neck pocket and the electronics i like the way the craftspeople at gibson did this one it was welldone out of the box i only had to adjust two saddles for intonation on the bridge – otherwise it was ready to go right out of the box the fretboard is perfect the fret ends were clean not rounded and invisible but clean just the same i think my most recent les paul a limited semihollowbody has the sweetest factory fret ends of any nonbound gibson i’ve handled this miii isn’t on par with that one – it has more edge and end to the feel than the lp the case is nicely manufactured the finish was completely cured and the bridge was nicely adjusted opening the control cavity reveals a simply done set of electronics that are neatly soldered and wellgrounded overall it’s really quite nice from stem to stern the new gibson  models are now in stock at zzounds celebrate  years of excellence and legendary tone wishes and wants i really love my miii i think the only thing that would have sent me over the top to buy a second one for more tuning options like keeping one in dadgad and one in cgcgcc with thicker strings would have been if gibson had taken the time to put the fretend neck binding on this guitar – black or body color or white… gibson’s fretend neck binding is in my opinion one of the sweetest features gibson offers i love the feel of it when i’m playing – or rather the lack of feeling the frets when i’m playing maybe just maybe a pickguard model with all the electronics behind the pickguard would be cool particularly if the guitar was wired with the gibson quick connect electronics wiring and changing system i would love to have a box of quick connect pickups that i could use to change things out on the fly… otherwise i love the miii – they did a great job with it please visit my sponsor zzoundscom for more
