openstack public cloud security customers racker culture newsroom home cloud insights my new role cloud insights my new role by lew moorman  july   i sent the following email to rackers this morning hey rackers i have not given you an update on my personal situation since early march i do have some news to share that impacts my life at rackspace my wife had successful surgery on her cancer in late march we remain hopeful for her future but there are real uncertainties and challenges ahead this has been a life changing experience for our family and coincides with some difficult ongoing health issues we face with our oldest daughter given these circumstances i have taken some time to assess my ability to balance the demands of leading the rack with the needs of my family the job of president for a company of this size and speed is a × endeavor like many of you when i am not here my mind is still mainly focused on our work i’ve found it a very rewarding trade because i get to build something special here with all of you but this is not a pace i can keep up in my current circumstances and you deserve full commitment from your leaders therefore over the next few months i will hand off of my daytoday responsibilities to other members of our senior leadership team at that time i will step down as president and chief strategy officer and assume a much more limited role i am not leaving rackspace i will remain involved as a member of our board of directors as a committed shareholder and as a parttime employee advising the company primarily on strategy and product direction our industry is in a time of transition which offers big challenges and opportunities and i am as excited as ever about our future i believe that the rise of openstack the appeal of a true hybrid cloud and the value and power of fanatical support will drive us to a great position in the market i am excited to watch the company’s progress evangelize for it and help in any way i can during the next few months of my transition i will remain  committed and focused on putting our leadership team in a position to win taylor rhodes’s transition to chief customer officer leading the sales and support segments is a great step a few weeks ago we added a new cmo in rick jackson to lead our marketing efforts i will continue to help with his integration but as of now he will report to lanham in terms of strategy product and corporate development i will continue to lead these groups fulltime during the transition i am working with the relevant senior leaders jim curry mark interrante and pat matthews on how best to structure these interrelated activities long term we have some strong approaches emerging  in addition i believe this will be the set of activities in which i will stay most involved as an advisor i cannot tell you how much the support from all of you has meant to me over the  years i’ve worked here and especially during my family’s health issues you truly are my friends and family i will not reminisce on my time here because this is not goodbye – i am still a racker i am open to discussing this change with you please reach out to me i will do my best to meet with anyone and everyone who has concerns and questions the rack is a huge part of my life and this change comes with very mixed emotions for me but i am confident it is right for me my

organizations officially announced the launch of openstack  from day one we have been shocked by the interest engagement and momentum of the community launched to build the de facto open standard cloud operating system  turns out the world was craving a truly open project devoted to cloud software and they quickly got behind openstack the stats are just amazing developer summits   –  attendees  –  attendees  –  attendees number of contributors who have signed cla   number of developer community members  number of downloads from launchpad alone   it was only with the cactus release in april that openstack compute nova became a productionready platform for most enterprises the number of companies — from large service providers across the globe to major fortune  companies — that are currently either deploying or experimenting will soon result in a huge spike in that number about  months ago rackspace decided definitively it would give away the intellectual property that built its cloud and embrace open source  our strategy rests on a few simple ideas   standards matter and the cloud really needed an open strong defacto approach  the core technology that runs datacenters should innovate faster and be available to all  in working with a great ecosystem of partners we could get access to better technology than we could on our own we have no regrets about the approach  yes we have and will continue to enable many competitors  true many companies will hold on to computing since they now have the tools they need to run it closer to the efficiency at which a cloud provider can but this was always part of the bargain  our job is to create a better experience to operate our cloud better to deliver scale and to offer an unparalleled level of service we call fanatical support™  in the end the tech won’t win the experience will  at least that’s how we see it what will the next year hold  here are just three of my predictions   mature code that is ready to deploy openstack is a young project the code is young and the ease of deployment is still too low however this is rapidly changing  not only is the code getting ready for major production systems deploying and operating openstack clouds will soon become easier  furthermore the number of features and capabilities will grow exponentially whether in core projects or in new projects emerging in networking identity management and webbased interfaces   big time deployments including rackspace the number of big name companies relying on openstack is going to shock people in the coming year  we are  percent committed to the openstack code base  in the coming months we will make several announcements regarding our plans and it’s our understanding we are not alone   the openstack economy startups

community you are missing a huge opportunity  as the network grows its value will multiple  interoperability standards will need to emerge and we hope to help make it happen together we will see how it turns out  as the project turns one we thank all those community members that have made it all possible  no question many organizations and companies have made huge contributions to this effort

modern networking  linuxcom  the source for linux information jump to navigation advertisement news for the open source professional login  create account facebook twitter google plus linkedin feeds brought to you by libby clark july   lew moorman open cloud key to modern networking rackspace president lew moorman made a splash late last month with his talk at gigaom’s structure conference on vendor lockin and the cloud he argued that simply cloning proprietary apis doesn’t solve the compatibility problem for developers that want to maintain ownership of their cloud applications here he explains and expands on that discussion in order for true innovation to happen in the cloud he says we need to develop open standards as a community it’s the best way to quickly advance modern computing it’s no secret that rackspace is placing its bets with openstack the open source cloud platform it launched with nasa in  and will soon turn over to the independent openstack foundation with openstack moorman says supporters are building an endtoend alternative to proprietary cloud systems and are thus reinventing the way modern networking happens this is the second article in a weekly series on linuxcom that will feature leaders of the open cloud in advance of the linux foundation’s cloudopen conference to be held aug  in san diego last week’s post featured richard kaufmann chief technologist for hp cloud services who discussed how openstack can overcome the adoption hurdle why build an open cloud join the conversation in our new open cloud forum  q how do you define open when it comes to the cloud lew moorman the modern computer is really the datacenter and a key question is what kind of software runs on that computer is that software going to be open will it be community driven free open and extendable and what will be the core operating system of the cloud there needs to be an open alternative the proprietary world created windows and the open world created linux it innovated on its own path and made windows better the open alternative really has to happen not only for pcs and laptops but for the cloud it really is the platform for modern computing openstack is setting out to be the operating system of the cloud it has incredible traction and it’s the fastest growing open source project in history it’s getting contributions from hundreds of companies and developers and maturing rapidly and many people are building businesses around it it’s the best shot the world’s got for an open cloud q you created quite a stir in the press with your talk addressing vendor lockin and the cloud at gigaom’s structure conference what were you hoping to accomplish moorman part of what i was talking about at structure was trying to build awareness of what the cloud really is the cloud is a very different way of running infrastructure and it depends on the application stack and when you decide to build your datacenter or all your apps around a certain stack whether amazon vmware or microsoft you need to recognize you’re making a big commitment to a stack your apps depend on that stack as if you made a decision to run java in oracle databases these are real commitments what we’re trying to make people aware of is there will be an open alternative and it may not be as mature as proprietary systems today but it’s evolving and we’ll get there it’s early in the cloud world we’re proposing that people be thoughtful about what they’re going to base their future apps on and make a conscious choice i don’t think the proprietary world should go away you could use both and many people will but an ecosystem that’s more fluid and extendible and open is comforting to people if you look at how modern apps are being built they’re so much more on open technologies it requires people to get involved and start using the technology and help it mature over time these open projects innovate q what did you mean when you said the cloud needs to be open from end to end it’s not just about open apis moorman some people seem to think that apis are the cloud and one thing that made the cloud so revolutionary is it’s programmatically accessible by api  but amazon s is a really complex distributed system the issue with a model that says “clone amazon” is that unless you have the core technology underneath it you can’t have a cloud we built swift it’s a totally distributed system and it’s not exactly like s having api compatibility for the basics like loading and getting an object is very easy but these technologies do complex things and will always be different because there are different technologies underneath the basic functionalities like file systems will be the same in the cloud but all you’ll ever get to is the lowest common denominator q what needs to happen to make your vision a reality moorman openstack is really setting out to build an open alternative from end to end they say we’re going to do networking not just set out to copy amazon they’re asking “how should networking be done in the modern world” we need to really innovate and build a visionary system that can power the future of computing amazon vmware and microsoft don’t have all the answers q how is rackspace involved in creating open standards and an open cloud moorman we’ve made massive investments in openstack and spent millions to get the project up and running we will be handing it over to the openstack foundation over the coming months and then we’ll just be another community member but a big contributor to the code we at rackspace are in the process of moving fully onto the code by august the compute side of our cloud will be on openstack and we will be launching database and block storage offers that we’ve been working on for  or  months we’re putting our money where our mouth is we’re also working to help people deploy privately and our services help with private deployments  eventually it will evolve from being deployed not just by specialists but by your typical it department q what are some lessons you’ve learned so far in moving to openstack moorman there’s no question these are incredibly complex technologies we have found that open source methodology for any given project can move more slowly than if you did it yourself because of the community process but the counterweight is that because you have so many people participating that in the long run things start running so much faster but it’s taken a bit longer than we would have liked we were hopeful it would go faster it’s also been a process learning how to build software in the open and work with the community it’s going in almost every way better than we would have expected we’re working with a lot of companies doing proof of concept it’s early days for the cloud and openstack is on the mind of pretty much everyone in big it it has real mindshare with that group and they’re kicking the tires you can see the community momentum q how does google’s entrance into the public cloud provider market change the open source scene dynamic moorman they’re another powerful proprietary stack they’ll create a lot of good options for people and it helps validate the future of cloud computing it looks like they’re targeting very large atscale buyers that typically do it themselves today they have the scale and experience to help people with that i’d love to see them to embrace an open system but they have their way of doing it and technology they’ve built themselves q what’s next for rackspace moorman we have a whole bunch of products getting ready to launch connecting openstack from public into the private world is a great value proposition the linux community has shown us the way we have built our whole business on open technologies from the beginning we started as a linux only shop and have built so many internal tools using open technologies and linux has been the heart of that the future of computing will be built on open
