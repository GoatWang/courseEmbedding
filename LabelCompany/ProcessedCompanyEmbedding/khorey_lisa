initiative december   by mark hagland  reprints lisa khorey shares her perspectives on upmc’s fiveyear  million enterprise analytics initiativeon october  the plushospital university of pittsburgh medical center upmc health system announced a new fiveyear  million enterprise healthcare analytics initiative to foster personalized medicine and other core strategic healthcare it goals for the organization partnering with several prominent vendors—oracle ibm informatica and dbmotion in a press release made public on that date the upmc organization noted that “upmc today announced that it intends to create a bestinclass data warehouse that brings together clinical financial administrative genomic and other information that today is difficult to integrate and analyze” the press release also included this quote from steven d shapiro md upmc’s chief medical and scientific officer “every patient is different every patient has a unique story this comprehensive analytics approach will enable us to treat each patient in a personalized way to produce the best possible results” shortly after the announcement of the initiative hci editorinchief mark hagland interviewed lisa khorey vice president of enterprise systems and data management regarding the initiative’s importance and its implications for the us healthcare system below are excerpts from that interview what was the origin of this initiative and what are upmc’s  strategic goals in all this the organization aims to really bring together new models of care based on good science and smart technology you can look at it as a triangle with all three elements feeding each other and that model really works for us because we have a very integrated organization where we’re trying to improve quality decrease cost etc we’re an integrated providerpayer system with close academic ties and a culture of innovation and it’s one where these goals are very present every day in our organization so it forces an awareness of how we might be able to solve these problems the center for innovative science which will open in  is our operational approach to good science and innovative models of care and one of the questions we want to ask through the center is how do we better understand medicine so the center will basically focus on personalized medicine and on cancer and aging lisa khorey meanwhile as we’ve moved forward as an organization we have a “happy” information management problem in that we spent ten years becoming very digital creating a truly digital environment and that’s terrific but the number of vendors that it takes to solve the problem of care delivery through electronic systems requires so many participants that you end up with siloed data medicine is very complex in itself and as a business it’s very complex as well so the consumer data set the business data set and the clinical data set those are all separate sets and our enterprise program and agenda are about putting data to work becoming much more actionable being able to qualitatively measure and to use sophisticated software and data models to support the science agenda and the emerging models of care and really to sum up to become more precise in our delivery of care which includes reducing variation in brief what needs to be done is to elevate relevant information and make it more available to endusers it’s not unlike what has happened in every other industry the challenge for medicine is that it’s the most complex data set anywhere our aim through this program and investment and the banner of personalized medicine is to take all that information and data and the business problems and the information management agenda and to put them all together and to bring that information to life to improve patient outcomes our goals are so simple they’re as simple as a doctor talking to a patient we want to elevate that experience to be as accurate and positive an experience as possible and to improve the outcomes of every such encounter so why upmc why this effort when we positioned it inside the organization and started to transform our organization to bring the different areas together—research corporate finance the whole provider division and our health plan—then we looked over what we had done for the past ten years and our investment in information technology and electronic medical records over the last decade really put us on a track to come together holistically to solve this problem together across all the lines of business and then there’s just our science agenda which is raising the bar on patient care that’s why this is happening in this particular organization right now might this add another layer of complexity or will it simplify thingspages  next › last » related insightswebinars solving data
