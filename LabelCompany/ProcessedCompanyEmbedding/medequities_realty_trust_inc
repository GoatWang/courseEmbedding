senior management and board of directors properties gruenepointeonpointe health texas portfolio leased to wholly owned subsidiaries of gruenepointe and managed by an affiliate of onpointe health one of the owners of gruenepointe this portfolio of  skilled nursing facilities is located in areas we believe have less competition and a stabletogrowing demand for additional patient services particularly higher acuity services that can sustain high occupancy levels which are characteristics similar to markets in which onpointe health has existing facilities and experience we believe that onpointe health’s experience and specialties in higher acuity services can allow these facilities to meet the needs of growing patient populations in markets previously underserved while achieving efficiencies within gruenepointe and onpointe health’s existing network of operations that would translate into higher profitability and solid regulatory compliance life generations portfolio the life generations portfolio is comprised of six high quality facilities located in attractive markets in san diego and the greater los angeles california area each of the five rated facilities in the life generations portfolio are rated four stars or higher by cms which differentiates them from other facilities in the same markets in addition the above average quality of care provided at the facilities operated by life generations as indicated by the cms star ratings has been a prominent factor in achieving robust patient occupancy levels we believe the locations of the facilities in major metropolitan areas and in close proximity to large population centers will allow the life generations portfolio to continue to maintain high occupancy levels the considerable replacement costs and development within these california markets should limit future development of competing facilities furthermore the health and safety code regulations imposed by the california office of statewide

over  clinics and other provider locations lakeway hospital is located in the highly affluent area of lakeway texas which is approximately  miles northwest of austin texas the population of the lakeway area has grown rapidly as the area has experienced strong investment in residential and commercial development we anticipate that the limited number of nearby competing facilities will allow

building kentfield hospital is one of only two licensed longterm acute care hospitals in the san francisco bay area market and benefits from a surrounding population of approximately  million according to the  us census which supports its bed demand kentfield hospital has been one of vibra healthcare’s top performing facilities in addition we believe kentfield hospital receives referrals

addition mountain’s edge hospital is expected to benefit from a daily bed minimum guarantee from a leading national managed care company mountain’s edge hospital includes imaging services an intensive

approximately  square feet and increase the number of licensed beds from  to  the property is located in spartanburg south carolina and benefits from significant entry barriers in the state the state of south carolina regulates the supply of certain healthcare providers through its certificate of need program the requirement to receive state authorization before developing new nursing and hospital facilities or expanding existing facilities creates a substantial barrier for bed expansion in south carolina we believe the expansion at magnolia place and restriction of skilled nursing facility

longterm acute care hospital licensed for  beds and located in henderson nevada horizon hospital is located in the affluent eastern section of the las vegas area and began admitting patients in february  prior to developing the property a detailed bed need analysis was performed to estimate potential demand for a new hospital using a census of acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities operating in the las vegas market in combination with zipcode level population and patient discharge data fundamental healthcare determined areas of the las vegas market were currently underserved the location of the horizon hospital was strategically chosen to take advantage of the unmet demand in the area particularly among elderly residents importantly the nevada state demographer estimates  growth in people aged  and older from  to  in clark county which includes las vegas and henderson nevada we believe that current capacity constraints will encourage hospitals to move patients once stabilized out of high cost acute care hospitals to stepdown facilities such as longterm acute care hospitals where the cost of continued care is significantly lower than that of an acute care hospital in addition fundamental healthcare has extensive experience in the las vegas market having operated there for more than  years   vibra rehabilitation hospital of amarillo leased to

although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these parameters investors have
