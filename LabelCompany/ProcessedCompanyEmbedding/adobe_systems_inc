macleans newsmagazine criticismsedit pricingedit adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being up to twice as much in nonus countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by  users in june  adobe further

companies based on a  survey on redditcom adobes reader and flash were listed on the  most hated programs of all time on techradarcom securityedit hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used

sold freehand a competing product freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator adobes flagship vectorgraphics editor the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next  years  altsys was then bought by macromedia which released versions  to  when adobe acquired macromedia in december  it stalled development of freehand in  effectively rendering it obsolete with freehand and illustrator adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems in  a group of  freehand graphic designers convened under the banner free freehand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe the suit alleged that adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand the dominant competitor to adobe’s illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an opensource community if it cannot update it internally as of  on its freehand product page adobe stated while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs software which supports both powerpc and intelbased macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista as of  the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page adobes software ftp server still contains a directory for freehand but it is empty see alsoedit san

mediacorp canada inc and was featured in macleans newsmagazine criticismsedit pricingedit adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being up to twice as much in nonus countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by  users in june  adobe further increased its prices in the uk by  in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar and uk users are not allowed to buy from the us store adobe ranked no  on a list of internet’s  most hated companies based on a  survey on redditcom adobes reader and flash were listed on the  most hated programs of all time on techradarcom securityedit hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswires customers which has been tied to the adobe security breachcitation needed they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state court and expose up to  social security numbers see also adobe creative cloud § criticism anticompetitive practicesedit adobe acquired aldus corp in  a software vendor that sold freehand a competing product freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator adobes flagship vectorgraphics editor the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next  years  altsys was then bought by macromedia which released versions  to  when adobe acquired macromedia in december  it stalled development of freehand in  effectively rendering it obsolete with freehand and illustrator adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems in  a group of  freehand graphic designers convened under the banner free freehand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe the suit alleged that adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand the dominant competitor to adobe’s illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an opensource community if it cannot update it internally as of  on its freehand product page adobe stated while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs software which supports both powerpc and intelbased macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista as of  the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page adobes software ftp server still contains a directory

mediacorp canada inc and was featured in macleans newsmagazine criticismsedit pricingedit adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being up to twice as much in nonus countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by  users in june  adobe further increased its prices in the uk by  in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar and uk users are not allowed to buy from the us store adobe ranked no  on a list of internet’s  most hated companies based on a  survey on redditcom adobes reader and flash were listed on the  most hated programs of all time on techradarcom securityedit hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswires customers which has been tied to the adobe security breachcitation needed they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state court and expose up to  social security numbers see also adobe creative cloud § criticism anticompetitive practicesedit adobe acquired aldus corp in  a software vendor that sold freehand a competing product freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator adobes flagship vectorgraphics editor the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next  years  altsys was then bought by macromedia which released versions  to  when adobe acquired macromedia in december  it stalled development of freehand in  effectively rendering it obsolete with freehand and illustrator adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems in  a group of  freehand graphic designers convened under the banner free freehand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe the suit alleged that adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand the dominant competitor to adobe’s illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an opensource community if it cannot update it internally as of  on its freehand product page adobe stated while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs software which supports both powerpc and intelbased macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista as of  the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page adobes software ftp server still contains a directory

mediacorp canada inc and was featured in macleans newsmagazine criticismsedit pricingedit adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being up to twice as much in nonus countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by  users in june  adobe further increased its prices in the uk by  in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar and uk users are not allowed to buy from the us store adobe ranked no  on a list of internet’s  most hated companies based on a  survey on redditcom adobes reader and flash were listed on the  most hated programs of all time on techradarcom securityedit hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswires customers which has been tied to the adobe security breachcitation needed they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state court and expose up to  social security numbers see also adobe creative cloud § criticism anticompetitive practicesedit adobe acquired aldus corp in  a software vendor that sold freehand a competing product freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator adobes flagship vectorgraphics editor the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next  years  altsys was then bought by macromedia which released versions  to  when adobe acquired macromedia in december  it stalled development of freehand in  effectively rendering it obsolete with freehand and illustrator adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems in  a group of  freehand graphic designers convened under the banner free freehand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe the suit alleged that adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand the dominant competitor to adobe’s illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an opensource community if it cannot update it internally as of  on its freehand product page adobe stated while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs software which supports both powerpc and intelbased macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista as of  the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page adobes software ftp server still contains a directory

mediacorp canada inc and was featured in macleans newsmagazine criticismsedit pricingedit adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being up to twice as much in nonus countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by  users in june  adobe further increased its prices in the uk by  in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar and uk users are not allowed to buy from the us store adobe ranked no  on a list of internet’s  most hated companies based on a  survey on redditcom adobes reader and flash were listed on the  most hated programs of all time on techradarcom securityedit hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswires customers which has been tied to the adobe security breachcitation needed they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state court and expose up to  social security numbers see also adobe creative cloud § criticism anticompetitive practicesedit adobe acquired aldus corp in  a software vendor that sold freehand a competing product freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator adobes flagship vectorgraphics editor the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next  years  altsys was then bought by macromedia which released versions  to  when adobe acquired macromedia in december  it stalled development of freehand in  effectively rendering it obsolete with freehand and illustrator adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems in  a group of  freehand graphic designers convened under the banner free freehand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe the suit alleged that adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand the dominant competitor to adobe’s illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an opensource community if it cannot update it internally as of  on its freehand product page adobe stated while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs software which supports both powerpc and intelbased macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista as of  the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page adobes software ftp server still contains a directory

infringing adobes copyright and violate adobes terms of service adobe also alleged softman of trademark violation by distributing incomplete versions of their software judge pregerson ruled that adobe has sold its software instead of licensed the software thus under the firstsale doctrine adobe can not control how softman resells those particular copies of adobe software after the initial sale the court also found that softman had not infringed on the eula because softman had never run the program and therefore never assented to the terms in addition the court found that factual disputes exist
