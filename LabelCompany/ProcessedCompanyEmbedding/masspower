megawatts has continually strived to innovate and improve alternative energy systems and technologies  this includes new innovations that significantly improve the efficiency of solarpower systems  our latest innovation the mass megawatts solarpower tracking system sts is designed to increase solar energy production by  with only a  increase in system cost pictured above is the solarpower tracking system prototype located in worcester massachusetts please see our new sts videos at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqtvwwzfbfg the patented sts technology is designed to automatically adjust the position of solar panels to receive an optimal level of direct sunlight throughout the day as the sun travels from east to west this delivers a  increase in solarpower generation as compared to stationary nontracking configurations  unlike other solar tracking technologies the mass megawatts sts utilizes a lowcost tracking framework that adds stability to the overall system while improving energy production levels future versions of the sts will offer a dualtracking capability which improves solarpower generation by an additional  the sts utilizes a revolutionary patentpending framework that significantly reduces the torque required to adjust the position of solar panels throughout the day unlike other tracking technologies that apply a vertical upanddown motion the sts rotates the solar panels into position using a horizontal motion the amount of torque needed to accomplish this movement is minimal and can be accomplished with a simpler lowercost design the sts framework also allows multiple solar units to share the same tracking mechanism instead of applying a separate tracker to each independent solar unit many solarpower units can be ‘daisychained’ together to share the same tracking mechanism with the same actuator this dramatically reduces the cost to implement a solar tracking solution at larger capacity installations with costs projected to drop from  to  a substantial savings that significantly improves roi and shortens the paybackperiod with the mass megawatts sts you get a  increase in solarpower generation with a minimal increase in capital expenditures lowcost ul listed tracking components can be shared by many solarpower units the sts framework supports most solar panel brands and can be retrofitted to existing solarpower systems the sts is also designed to withstand highwinds and extreme weather with the use of bumpers and shock absorbers that prevent sudden erratic movements during highwind periods the bumpers provide a safe landing place for the solar panels in the event of extreme weather while the shock absorbers stabilize the panel movements during high winds this improves the overall stability and efficiency of the mass megawatts sts the sts allows commercial and residential solarpower users as well as developers to lower the costs associated with solarpower generation the targeted powercapacity can been reached with fewer solar panels andor powergeneration can be increased far beyond current levels in many locations this improved poweroutput translates into a  rate of return for the customer with investment payback occurring in the rd year  further by taking advantage of a lease program or power purchase agreement ppa arrangement with the company a customer may realize an immediate positive cash flow as energy savings andor revenues can exceed the monthly payment due starting at  kw rated units a mass megawatts sts system is appropriate for groundlevel residential and business sites as well as

current electric bill mass megawatts also offers flexible payment options including nomoneydown arrangements to either lease the system or enter into a power purchase agreement in these cases mass megawatts would install the system at your home for free and you would pay a monthly fee for the energy that’s produced that would usually be less than the rate you’re currently paying with the utility this gives most homeowners the financial means to immediately lower their energy costs with a solar power system if you’re interested in purchasing a system outright you should know that there are government incentives that can substantially reduce your total cost after the first year for instance through  the federal government is offering a  tax credit based on the total cost of a solar power system there are also many state and local incentives that can recoup thousands of additional dollars when making an investment in solar power as you might guess solar power systems work best when they have maximum exposure to sunlight throughout the day homes with southward facing roofs with minimal sun obstruction are ideal also for rooftop installations you’d want the roof to be in good condition before installing any solar components mass megawatts makes the process easy to go solar easy we work with each customer to design an ideal solar power solution that meets their budgetary

you much money you can start to save by switching to solar power we look forward to helping you go solar small business solar power please click here small businesses have a great opportunity for substantial savings with a mass megawatts solar power system unlike most residential locations many commercial sites consume a higher level of energy that causes them to incur a demand charge from the utility when this happens energy costs can increase significantly often adding a premium of over  to the total bill this is often classified as ‘general service with demand billing’ and applies to many small commercial customers for example a demand charge is typically applied when monthly electricity usage exceeds a certain level such as  kwh per month over  consecutive months when this occurs the utility will install a ‘demand meter’ to measure your peak level of energy usage during each billing cycle and assess an additional fee for this demand level for example if you have  kw peak demand at  per kw you’re looking at an increase of  per month this isn’t good news for your energy bill however with a solar power system from mass megawatts you can avoid this added expense the solar power you generate will reduce the amount of energy you need to use from the utility this in turn will keep you below the demand threshold and eliminate this charge it’s a great way to reduce your electric bill by a few hundred dollars each month while eliminating the demand charge by itself can provide substantial savings you’ll also be saving money by replacing the more expensive utilitysupplied power with the lowercost solar power you’re generating mass megawatts proprietary technology provides a strategic cost advantage in the solar industry that we pass along to our
