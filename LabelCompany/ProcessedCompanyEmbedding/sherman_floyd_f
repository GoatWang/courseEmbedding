welcome to our first quarter  earnings call i feel very good about the start we got on the year in our first quarter this positive start was accomplished in spite of significant headwinds we faced during the quarter such as weather lumber inflation and labor in spite of these challenges our people delivered in my opinion outstanding results of which i am very appreciative ill start with a brief update on our sales and recent events that are impacting our lumber prices and then ill turn the call over to chad who will provide an update of our  priorities following chad peter will discuss our financial results in more detail after my closing comments regarding our outlook we will take your questions lets begin our discussion on slide  with an overview of the macro housing markets in  the new residential housing market reached almost  million total starts with  singlefamily starts this is well below the historic average just growing now the levels we have historically seen in recessionary troughs continued labor shortages will continue to constrain housing growth from  we believe there are still several years of growth ahead of us and are estimating mid singledigit growth in the singlefamily homebuilding market in  additionally we believe the repair and remodeling market will grow in the low singledigit range our sales for the quarter were  billion sales excluding closed locations grew  over the first quarter of  and were benefited by approximately  as a result of the impact of commodity price inflation on our sales sales volume excluding closed locations and commodity inflation grew approximately  in the singlefamily new residential homebuilding end market as compared to singlefamily start growth as reported by the census bureau of  additionally sales in the repair and remodel and other end market increased over prior year by  offset by declines in multifamily sales turning to page  one of our key growth priorities is to expand share in our higher margin valueadded products our sales of valueadded products included manufactured products windows doors and millwork for the quarter increased  versus  the investments we made in our manufacturing facilities in  are paying off with sales of our manufactured products growing  over the first quarter of  we believe our company is wellpositioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of wellpublicized labor shortages and increased cycle times through our manufactured and valueadded products across our natural footprint we will continue to focus on growing our valueadded products faster than our overall sales and capital investments for growth will be targeted towards this opportunity please turn to page  where we will cover some recent developments in lumber pricing and import tariffs the department of commerce has announced its preliminary import duty on canadian lumber averaging just under  as you may know canadian lumber imports were taxed under the previous softwood lumber agreement for a decade and that agreement expired in late  this preliminary duty is in response to the suit filed by us producers when a new agreement was not reached it is enforceable for approximately four months and will be replaced by the final finding of the itc itll be paid including any retroactive penalties by the canadian mills not directly by bldr or any other lbm distributor however as you would expect the tariff does impact our purchase price as a final determination by the itc is not due until late next year there most likely will be a gap in both timing and possibly the amount of the final duty including retroactivity and any additional antidumping findings yeartodate composite prices are up approximately  and have not moved significantly since the announcement uncertainty around rates and availability on imported products is having an impact on domestic lumber products with buyers stocking up on more inventory ill now turn it over to chad who will discuss the impact of the resulting commodity inflation on our business as well as an update on our  priorities m chad crow  builders firstsource inc thank you floyd and good morning ill begin on slide  with an overview of the impact of the higher lumber prices on our business we believe lumber prices will remain considerably higher than last year but likely not at current levels given the uncertainty around the final canadian tariff and the timing gap between the initial determination which lapses in september and the final finding by the itc late in the year we believe there could be significant fluctuations in the imported lumber prices during  domestic lumber will also have inflationary pressures as uncertainty around pricing and supply out of canada continues as you know rising lumber prices can cause gross margin and ebitda conversion ratio compression for the company in the shortterm but in the longterm higher prices benefit the company in higher revenue and profit dollars assuming todays prices commodity inflation benefit to total net sales could be in the  to  range for the year turning to page  i would like to share the progress against our  priorities including our increased focus on profitable market share expansion and improved operational efficiency first we are committed to capturing profitable market share and growing faster than the market by leveraging our scale and strong customer relationships as well as continuing our investment in our sales force i am pleased to report that we had a strong start to the year relative to the growth in singlefamily starts and repair and remodel market growth we also believe we have significant opportunities to increase the reach and penetration of our highermargin valueadded products these products allow for manufacturing and assembly of homebuilding materials offsite aiding homebuilders with the wellpublicized labor shortages and extended lead times growth in total valueadded products in the quarter was  over the first quarter of  led by growth in manufactured products of over  we are focusing on implementing best practices across the organization in order to drive incremental operational efficiencies our initial focus will be on logistics backoffice automation and using technology to improve integration with and service to our customers our continued focus on cash generation will allow us to fund these initiatives as well as continue to delever the balance sheet we are on track to generate  million to  million of free cash flow in the year finally we are only as strong as our people and therefore we are committed to attract and retain the best associates in the industry i am pleased to announce that we have been named to the  forbes best large employers list i will now turn the call over to peter who will review our financial results in more detail peter jackson  builders firstsource inc thank you chad good morning everyone i will first discuss the current quarter results on slide  as a reminder we have included adjusted figures to normalize for onetime integration closure and other costs for the first quarter we reported net sales of  billion a  increase compared to the first quarter of  excluding the impact of closed locations including an estimated  benefit from commodity price inflation we estimate that our sales volume grew approximately  in the singlefamily new residential homebuilding end market and approximately  in the repair and remodel and other end market offset by declines in multifamily our gross margin percentage was  down approximately  basis points from  last year the decrease on a yearoveryear basis was largely attributable to the recent commodity price inflation drags on our margins although commodity price inflation generally benefits the companys operating results in the longterm it can cause shortterm gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling this is due to the shortterm pricing commitments we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity markets our sga as a percentage of sales decreased by  basis points on a yearoveryear basis the reduction was largely attributable to cost efficiencies the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired probuild assets and commodity inflation cost leverage excluding the depreciation impact cost savings and cost leverage benefit was  basis points gaap net interest expense in the quarter of  million includes  million of cost associated with the amendment of our term loan and revolving credit facilities in addition interest expense in the first quarter of  was reduced by a  million gain on debt extinguishment related to the note exchange transactions executed in that period absent these expenses adjusted interest expense was  million in the first quarter of  a  million reduction compared to interest expense for the first quarter of  largely as a result of a series of transactions that have reduced the companys interest expense adjusted net income was  million or  per diluted share compared to an adjusted net loss of  million or  per diluted share in the first quarter of  this improvement was largely a result of cost savings realized revenue growth and interest savings driven by debt refinancing our adjusted ebitda of  million which equated to  yearoveryear growth slightly exceeded our guidance range of  million to  million due to higher sales adjusted ebitda grew  million to  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales for the first quarter of  the yearoveryear growth and improvement was driven largely by cost savings initiatives and revenue growth offset by commoditydriven gross profit margin compression we have provided an adjusted ebitda reconciliation on slide  turning to slide  we reduced debt outstanding last year by  million and we expect free cash flow generation will give us the opportunity to further reduce debt in  we believe this will be driven by ebitda growth and a focus on working capital efficiency which is estimated to run between  and  of incremental sales we expect to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately  of sales we expect our current nol tax asset should shelter us from paying federal cash taxes in  assuming no material changes in shareholder base or tax code changes as a result of the opportunistic capital market transactions executed over the last year and a half cash interest should be reduced to approximately  million in  cost savings initiatives should benefit  by approximately  million over  and we expect onetime probuild integration costs of  million to  million as a result we expect to generate approximately  million to  million in cash flow for the full year  our business typically uses cash in the first half and generates cash in the second half of the year due to seasonal working capital needs cash used from operations and investing in the first quarter was  million this was in line with our expectations in annual guidance of  million to  million in positive cash flow turning to slide  total liquidity at march   was  million consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cashonhand the company has executed multiple capital market transactions in the last year – year and a half and extended our maturity profile and improved our financial flexibility with accumulative goforward annual interest savings of approximately  million we will continue to evaluate opportunistic transactions to lower our interest expense or otherwise address our capital structure in the first quarter the company amended and extended its term loan credit facility to  with an interest reduction of  or approximately  million annually as well as extending its revolving credit facility to  our weighted average longterm debt maturity is currently  years and our maturity profile allows multiyear runway of ebitda growth and cash flow generation to reduce debt levels before refinancing is required we are committed to further debt reduction and the terms of our debt allow the company to repay our most expensive bonds first benefiting future free cash flow we have made progress on our leverage ratio the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at year end march   was  times a  turn reduction from  we believe we should be able to move this ratio to  times or less by year end  i would like to provide color on the second quarter of  as well as how we are currently thinking about full year  we expect allin sales growth in the high singledigit range for the second quarter with about half coming from volume and half from commodity inflation our market growth assumptions for the quarter include mid singledigit growth in singlefamily starts low singledigit growth in repair and remodeling and modest declines in the multifamily market given the current labor constraints that are putting a governor on growth we are expecting the lowest growth rates in the busiest summer building season as we approach a maximum number of starts the market can handle whether singlefamily starts can grow faster this summer in our opinion depends on the severity of labor constraints from a gross margin perspective we will continue to have headwinds from commodity inflation in the quarter which could equate to gross margin percentage on a yearoveryear basis being in line or down a bit more than  basis points similar to what we experienced in quarter one cost savings are expected to continue this would shake out to an estimated ebitda growth of  to  yearoveryear full year our expectations for singlefamily starts are in the mid singledigit range with multifamily down mid singledigits and rr up low singledigits we anticipate continued benefit from commodity prices on our sales given the uncertainty and potential fluctuations for the balance of the year in commodity prices the yearoveryear commoditydriven gross margin impact will negatively impact our ebitda conversion rates while in a more stable commodity environment we expect to convert sales to ebitda at a  to  rate we expect our conversion rate could be a bit lower in  however to reiterate high lumber prices provide benefit to total ebitda in the long range but can impact our margins in the shortterm ill now turn the ball back over to floyd for his closing comments floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc thank you peter turning to our outlook i remain positive about the future of our company i believe the housing industry remains on a trajectory of steady growth the reports we are getting from our people in the field continue to be very optimistic about the current business conditions relating to housing construction activity however given labor constraints continue to impact the rate of singlefamily starts we do expect a flattening of the seasonal curve during this stage of the recovery as builders may approach a capacity of houses they can build in the busiest summer months we are increasing our focus on growth with valueadded products national builders who are capturing share as well as leveraging our strong local relationships and investments in our sales force to grow faster than the market our company is wellpositioned to be the building supply company of choice for builders around the country thanks to our geographic reach enhanced product offerings national manufacturing capabilities and differentiated customer service our focus will be to leverage our national scale and sales capability to grow faster than the market with a focus on profitable growth and valueadded products these strengths our scale and the leverage provided by our cash flow generation and debt reduction plans combined to make builders firstsource an industry leader with significant growth opportunities i believe we will create significant value for our shareholders in the years to come furthermore i attribute the success we have achieved so far to all of our hardworking and dedicated associates they truly are the people who make this company go thank you and ill now turn the call over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator we can take our first question from trey grooms please go ahead trey h grooms  stephens inc hey good morning guys floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc morning trey peter jackson  builders firstsource inc good morning trey h grooms  stephens inc just a quick question on the labor commentary there floyd were seeing apparently some enough labor constraints where it could start to limit the type of recovery we could see in – you said in the summer months a flattening of the seasonal curve is that kind of across the board in your opinion as you look at your footprint geographically or is there areas that are more concerning than others and if you can just kind of talk to that and then also i mean it seems that were still a long way away from normal demand for housing if you can just kind of talk about how you think that impacts the cycle i mean is that going to shortstop us here for – in the recovery earlier than what we normally would see or is it just going to be elongated curve what your thoughts there floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc yeah trey we are seeing the labor situation pretty much across all areas of the markets that we serve but were building more houses than we did last year we built more houses last year than we did the year before we continue to find ways to solve the labor problem find ways to alleviate the labor problems certainly the labor saving products that we offer the builder is definitely helping out you can see it from the sales gain that we had on those products that the builders are turning more and more to the use of these labor saving products and they offer true value enhancements to the builder in getting their houses built as tough as the labor situation is i think somehow were going to continue finding ways to attract more people into the labor force and i really dont see us hitting a wall to where we cant build any more houses what i do see happening is that we tend to get labor cut and it causes the flow on a jobsites to go on in surges you get behind on the concrete pile in  the concrete gets caught up and then you got the framing surge and then the finish out surge the jobs dont run as smooth as they once did but the end result is we continue to build more houses and were getting the job done i dont think that the builders are missing – at least not from what im hearing from our people in the field and from talking with the various builders i dont think theyre missing any sales because of the labor issues and so yeah im not as negative about labor as what the picture looked like a year or two ago and i just see us continuing to find ways to get the job done m chad crow  builders firstsource inc and i think its just going to end up in a slower steady recovery which is great and i would also think that if you continue to see multifamily cool down you will see some of that labor move over to the singlefamily side of construction trey h grooms  stephens inc okay makes sense thanks for that and then looking at i guess the commentary around lumber and chad i think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you expect lumber prices to stay higher but maybe not where they are today and that it sounds like its going to be fairly choppy i guess whats behind that expectation are you seeing more supply come in or domestically more – just kind of recommissioning some lines or anything like that whats behind your expectation after having a fairly rapid increase in lumber prices and then kind of stabilization whats behind your thoughts around that m chad crow  builders firstsource inc well a lot of it its just historically you never see flat lumber prices for very long and when i say lower than they are today im not talking significantly lower i think maybe the framing lumber composite is around  right now may you see it bounce around between  and  over the summer months which is still a very good environment for us trey h grooms  stephens inc and thats embedded in some of the commentary you had around q is that lumber outlook m chad crow  builders firstsource inc yeah other than when i said the sales for the year might be benefited by  to  thats assuming prices stay where they are today if they dip a little lower than that on average then maybe were on the low end of that inflation impact but yeah generally speaking thats embedded in the commentary trey h grooms  stephens inc okay got it and then last one from me is on the manufactured products up  floyd i think in your comments you mentioned that you made some changes there last year i think youve touched on that in the past a little bit but those are starting to pay off that  i mean thats obviously very strong but with the shortage of labor youre talking about in the backdrop there obviously you would expect a continued outperformance from the manufactured product side of things but whats the run rate there i mean is that  or was there something unique was it really the comp on that side which i dont think it was but are you guys – what was going on in that quarter that was unique that – or should we continue to expect that level of growth floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc yeah i really cant sit here and say trey that theres anything truly unique i do think theres probably a couple factors that are coming into play one is and i believe alluded to in previous calls that as we are now getting lets say more stable and we move through the integration process our people are focusing more and more on how to build the markets and certainly theres a lot more management attention being given to building market share we have invested were going to continue to invest in adding component plants this year were slated to probably get started another five plants were getting more coverage in our markets so all of these factors including – yeah i think we are the best at the roof truss floor truss wall panel business in the country we aggressively make it a part of our package its all part of our selling valueadded products and i think our sales force is reacting to that message on a steadily improving basis so i think thats all the reasons why we grew the way we did we still have plenty of competition theres a lot of good competition out there but i think were the best at the game and its paying off for us trey h grooms  stephens inc all right well thats really encouraging thanks guys and congrats again on a great quarter and good luck in q floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc i really appreciate you saying that trey because yeah we worked hard in the quarter and it definitely showed trey h grooms  stephens inc yeah paid off thanks guys operator we can take our next question from will randow please go ahead will randow  citigroup global markets inc hey good morning guys and congrats on the progress floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc thank you will m chad crow  builders firstsource inc thanks will will randow  citigroup global markets inc so i just was hoping to get a bit more granularity on your prior comments just simply looking at the lumber chart on slide  which has been focused on in a couple of prior questions why havent you guys raised full year  cash flow guidance given the gap up in lumber prices that i guess shouldnt have only caused net full year benefit to your commodity sales but also should boost other pockets that are levered to lumber like the trusses business peter jackson  builders firstsource inc well we do invest in working capital at a rate of about  to  of sales so as the increasing value of our lumber is recorded in inventory we will see a headwind on the cash flow will randow  citigroup global markets inc but i guess i have to work through the math but whats implied by my question was there should be a net benefit especially when you consider that not  just a quarter commodity your truss business for example will see that benefit so i assume there should be a net benefit but am i wrong in that peter jackson  builders firstsource inc there is a net benefit in the long run in the nearterm we do have compression in gross margins and well have to digest that as we go through the rest of this year and as we get better clarity on where those pricings will be well give you a better look at full year will randow  citigroup global markets inc and then a followup on labor constraints builders really arent talking about that issue the way they were over the past two years meaning its become less of an issue based on their commentary but maybe thats wrong so with that said on valueadded products you really have two drivers there one good and one bad on the good side builders as you mentioned need improved cycle times if i remember correctly you can take two weeks out of the rough for a home maybe one to two weeks and its a week cycle time so reduce it by about  on the bad most builders are using less trusses as they shift down to lower asp product meaning entry level and movedown at least thats what were seeing in the field so it appears that they may use less trusses given their focus on the movedownentry level buyer so i guess how do you think about the tailwind of incremental structured panels and the potential headwind of builders pulling out  cost including trusses floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc well i think theres going to be a continuation obviously the builders arent talking as much about the labor issues because we in the supply industry who build – really build the houses for the builders are finding ways to get the problem solved and there are no longer is the holdup i do not believe that builders are losing sales because of the inability to get homes built on a timely basis but what theyre finding is that in order to get this done theyve got to utilize more laborsaving products going into the home and thats what theyre doing and we see this as a continual growth side of the business for us theres more and more demand for the laborsaving products and valueadd products going into the home so i see that as a continually growing part of our business i dont see it as a tailwind will randow  citigroup global markets inc and if i could just sneak one last one in some of your specialty products call it windows doors roofing insulation you had then singledigit growth which was lower than overall company and i assume thats because of lumber inflation meaning skewing the growth how do you feel about gaining traction in terms of growing for example the roofing business across stores as you extend probuilds product offering across the builders firstsource platform peter jackson  builders firstsource inc i think we feel really good about the growth i think what you saw there in that number is the mix of where we sell and some projects that float in and out but overall the growth in that part of our business has been very healthy and strong we feel good about it going forward will randow  citigroup global markets inc okay thanks guys and good luck for the year operator we can take our next question from nishu sood please go ahead nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc thank you i wanted to also ask on the lumber import tariff you folks mentioned that in the industry some buying of – change obviously buying patterns prebuying around the price volatility so i wanted to ask how have you folks handled that around the tariff and the price volatility how did it flow through so far this year and also just as importantly if this volatility is likely to continue as youre pointing out and which makes a lot of sense how might that affect the  to  incremental working capital as a percentage of sales target would it put that at risk potentially m chad crow  builders firstsource inc to answer your first question we were fairly aggressive earlier in the year leading up to the announcement that came out several weeks ago youre limited to some degree on what you can do you physically have to have room for the inventory and then we were able to negotiate some buys over several weeks so we had a pretty good position going into the announcement but like us and our competitors we will all still be out there buying you cant stock six months worth of inventory so were back out there buying again your second question yes it could be a slight headwind to working capital but i still think generally speaking that  to  range is going to be close to where we would come in at nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc got it thats great very helpful and then i also wanted to – looking back to midyear last year there was some slowdown in sales and at that stage you folks always gave us the straight talk and you talked about perhaps the internal focus on synergies and integration detracted from selling efforts now if we look back so if we think about the new kind of flattening out of seasonality and perhaps it has more to do with kind of industry constraints maybe we can look back at that sales slowdown last year and think about it in those terms versus the focus on the synergies and the integration now obviously the positive side of that is maybe you folks were a little bit too hard on yourselves last year but then looking ahead maybe it means that the bounce back in sales might not be as much as expected if its more of an industrywide phenomenon how do you folks think about that now in retrospect and i guess the broader question is have you have been continuing to refocus on generating the sales growth how should we expect that to play out this year m chad crow  builders firstsource inc well personally i think the distraction factor last year was real because we were trying to measure our growth versus what we thought the end market growth was during the same period so i think it was real its in a way theoretical its soft its hard to measure but i feel like its real and so thats not really trying to compare it to the other part of your question which is the flattening of the seasonal curve we were really trying to compare it to what we felt like the market was growing at that point in time so i think it was real i think if you were to go out and hold the guys out in the field they would tell you the same thing we really tried to make  a year with as little change as possible so the guys can focus on the business now to your point that doesnt mean we wont have a flattening of the seasonal curve but i kind of see those as two different issues nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc got it got it okay and just last one on the repair and remodeling nice strong sales growth there kind of in the mid six percentage i think so anything unusual there your year forecast still for the kind of  to  i believe so how should we think about the strong performance there m chad crow  builders firstsource inc yeah i cant think of anything unusual there pretty small piece of our business overall and in a lot of markets the winter weather wasnt too bad so that probably weight into a little bit but nothing unusual that comes to mind nishu sood  deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator we can take our next question from alex rygiel please go ahead alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co thank you very nice quarter gentlemen floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc thank you m chad crow  builders firstsource inc thank you alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co could you expand a little bit upon any geographic demand variances that you might have noticed in the quarter floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc no peter jackson  builders firstsource inc so just with those numbers i mean we were up across most of the country pretty consistently particularly singlefamily look very good for us certain regions given their economic exposure i think maybe were held back a bit oil impacted locations generally had a tougher go than some of the others floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc but if we look at our top  state the seven out of the  had doubledigit increases the remaining three were high singledigit so the top  state for us that approximate twothirds a little better than twothirds of our total volume so we had a lot of strength in the big producing states im very pleased to see in texas again doubledigit performance houston is starting to come around real nicely for us we had a real positive gain in houston and a nice gain so that market is very very important to us and its even as part of the state and so we had a good mixture all across the board very good performances in our markets alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co and as it relates to the sales force expansion did you see any net benefit in the first quarter and if not i suspect wed be witnessing benefit in q and beyond and then also kind of transition into a little bit more detail on your outlook for sga leverage over the next couple quarters m chad crow  builders firstsource inc well ill tackle the first part of that yes we track very closely the salesmen that were hiring through this program that we implemented early last year and with hiring any one youre going to have some that really outperform and some that their performance is a little lacking but were tracking them closely were training them and so yeah on a net basis were starting to see some really nice results from these guys were still kind of on the frontend of that it does take a new salesman in this industry a while to build up a book of business but feel good about the program so far as far as sga ill let peter tackle that one peter jackson  builders firstsource inc yeah as far as sga i think that well continue to see leverage as the commodities stay higher and that lumber pricing works to our advantage in that space but otherwise i think consistent performance as we see the benefits of our operational improvements for the full year but we continue invest in different areas of the business as we see opportunities alex j rygiel  fbr capital markets  co thank you very much operator and we can take our next question from keith hughes please go ahead keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you one detail question on tax the  adjusted  there was virtually no tax what kind of taxes on an adjusted basis would you expect to be accruing the remainder of the year peter jackson  builders firstsource inc yes so for this year we would anticipate kind of that  tax rate but we are not intending – were not expecting to be a cash taxpayer this year because we will utilize our nols for the federal tax portion a couple of assumptions there one being that theres no fundamental changes in the tax code and second that there arent any significant changes in our shareholder base that could cause us to defer any portion of that nol keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc but from an adjusted eps well see roughly  in second third and fourth quarter peter jackson  builders firstsource inc yes thats our expectation keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay jennifer pasquino  builders firstsource inc theres virtually no net income so you have very little tax accrual in the first quarter its seasonal business that follows that so keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc yes im asking it because the adjusted eps means  as you get bigger nominal  quarters jennifer pasquino  builders firstsource inc yeah so in q and q youll see something more in line because we make more net income keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and if you look longerterm i know youve laid out what youre going to do for us in terms of debt reduction for this year assuming trends remain as youve kind of highlighted for  and  i would assume debt reduction would still be the main goal of the company in  or could that change a little bit peter jackson  builders firstsource inc well i mean we continue to look at the nearterm goals for ourselves right like you mentioned trying to get under  by the end of  and to that  to  range within  i think weve touched on this a couple of points and i think were consistently thinking this way and thats that were going to reassess where we are in the market cycle to determine where the best direction for us will be we continue to look at tuckin opportunities in the interim and when we get to that point well consider what our options play out in front of us but clearly debt reduction is a great opportunity for us to release value and looking at this market at that point i think makes a lot more sense keith hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you operator we can take our next question from john baugh please go ahead john baugh  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you good morning and congrats on a good quarter i was wondering if we could talk maybe longerterm theres obviously a lot of moving parts shortterm with margins but as your valueadd products grow and you had given an overall  to  incremental is that a number that stays in that range improves i guess im asking can the valueadded mix be accelerated or – because i believe probuild is well behind the predecessor company im just kind of curious as to how that moves margin through time and what the incremental might be on that business versus the rest of your business m chad crow  builders firstsource inc well youre right longterm and we have mentioned in the past that there were holes in the probuild side of the business on the manufacturing side so that is the area were targeting now and i think thats helping to contribute to the growth in that category typically to get  to  incremental ebitda youre going to need gross margin expansion in the quarter and youre going to need the leveraging of your sga if you have gross margin compression as you know its really hard to get to that  to  so i think if we can get past this period of inflationary headwinds you will start to see gross margin expansion part of that will be due to the growth in valueadd and i think we will kind of find that sweet spot to grow beyond the  incremental probably some quarters you can but i think longterm that would be very difficult to consistently outperform that just largely due to the volatility that you do see in commodities over time but yeah overall as our mix changes our gross margin should strengthen it wasnt that long ago we were   range until we hit this period of inflation so if we can see some stabilization in prices i see no reason why we cant start getting back up to those levels john baugh  stifel nicolaus  co inc and is there a constraint given proximity to a manufacturing site or wherever youre doing value add components what would be – if you were  converted to the markets that made sense what would be the possible mix of valueadded and i realize it could take some time to get there and also in that question would we expect to see perhaps rather than acquisitions maybe more capex in terms of building out those capabilities longerterm m chad crow  builders firstsource inc well as you know legacy bfs total valueadd had gotten close to  of our business thats manufactured products and the millwork category im trying to remember the highest weve got to from a manufactured product it was probably close to  that sound about right floyd floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc yeah m chad crow  builders firstsource inc and so i think if we can get the entire footprint built out as you said itll take time but i think we can get back to those historical levels you can ship trusses and panels   miles its a better proposition shipping those than it is sticks so to some degree you are limited by the proximity of your plant john baugh  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thank you and good luck m chad crow  builders firstsource inc thank you operator we can take our next question from mike dahl please go ahead matthew bouley  barclays capital inc hey good morning this is matt bouley on for mike today thanks for taking our questions i just wanted to followup on the earlier discussion on sga leverage and the  basis points decline ex da that you called out should we expect any incremental investments going forward any additional sales force investments and how should that interplay with the cost efficiencies that youve called out so the question is i mean should we expect a similar level of leverage going forward as you did in the first quarter thank you peter jackson  builders firstsource inc well i think its definitely fair to say that we will continue to make investments were strong believers in the programs that weve been supporting and we see opportunities going forward for additional programs to drive operational improvement so clearly well continue to invest as far as leverage goes we have every expectation that increasing lumber price will drive leverage for us and we think theres a consistency there although our business is quite seasonal so we will respond to the growth requirements of the business with the appropriate head count that said i think its fair to expect leverage out of sga as we grow may be not at  points but improvement matthew bouley  barclays capital inc okay understood thank you and then i wanted to ask a little further about the strength in manufactured products do you sense that youre gaining share with existing customers as a result of the labor shortage or how much would you say is due to this true market expansion or gaining new customers as you kind of expand capacity to different regions thank you floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc we definitely can see we are adding new customers and we are taking a larger share of existing customers wallet its a combination of both on the newer customers because youre starting with a new customer it takes a while for those volumes to build up but nevertheless it is adding significantly to the progress were making with our component products matthew bouley  barclays capital inc okay got it thank you very much operator we can take our next question from matt mccall please go ahead matt mccall  seaport global securities llc thanks good morning everybody floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc hey matt peter jackson  builders firstsource inc good morning matt mccall  seaport global securities llc so i dont want to knit pick these numbers too much but i think you said your multifamily outlook is now down low singledigits flat  in my notes its flat to down singlefamily also ticked a little bit lower from what i write  to  to up mid singledigits i know its just a couple of points here and there but i guess the question is if labor is the main issue for singlefamily and multifamily declines are going to provide more labor for singlefamily chad i think you said that is there another constraint thats pushing that singlefamily outlook a little bit lower from what we had last in our notes jennifer pasquino  builders firstsource inc im sorry so youre asking if were dropping our guidance on singlefamily matt mccall  seaport global securities llc well the last time i had in my notes is singlefamily of seven days and i think you just said midsingle and maybe thats the same thing maybe youd havent changed it but when i saw it it looks like multifamily is down just a little bit more the outlook is down maybe i misreading or misinterpreting what youre saying but  jennifer pasquino  builders firstsource inc yeah i think weve always said multifamily is going to be down and i think we said mid to midhigh so  m chad crow  builders firstsource inc we havent changed our forecast at this point matt mccall  seaport global securities llc okay all right jennifer pasquino  builders firstsource inc yeah matt mccall  seaport global securities llc all right so misinterpret so we talked a lot about lumber maybe could you talk to us a little bit about some of the product categories from a price from a cost perspective just the trends youre seeing from an inflation perspective just in general floyd f sherman  builders firstsource inc i think most of the other products where price increases have been announced by the industry is pretty much difficult for us but its running very low singledigits for the most part and many of those increases were announced prior to the end of the year so that you had chance to get those built into your pricing models typically you get some anywhere from  to  days advance notice of it and so there wasnt much of that and that showed up in the first quarter but its been pretty much as usual and i dont see anything really unusual going on in this area so matt mccall  seaport global securities llc okay all right thats fair thanks for that so the last one i had the outlook for inflation are you expecting the pressure to continue in the back half or – i think chad you said prices could come down a little bit or the potential for us to get a better price cost match and thus better incremental margin in the back half m chad crow  builders firstsource inc yeah i think thats accurate and as you know we do have pricing commitments with many of our customers that can – that you can go out as much as  days and so as we get the opportunity to reset those at more current market prices you should see improvements in the back half of the year matt mccall  seaport global securities llc okay so peter your comment on the normal ebitda conversion being a little lower than the  to  maybe thats the case for the first half back half is in that range maybe a little better or – is that the way to think about it peter jackson  builders firstsource inc yeah thats correct so we would see pressure until it stabilizes and then catch back up to chads point matt mccall  seaport global securities llc okay thank you all operator we can take our next question from nick coppola please go ahead nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc hey good morning m chad crow  builders firstsource inc morning nick nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc so i just wanted to followup on the earlier conversation on buyers stocking up on lumber inventories how big of a drag do you think that would be on q do you expect that there would be a meaningful impact there m chad crow  builders firstsource inc what do you mean by a drag on q nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc so buyers worked on inventories rather than buying or getting new shipments m chad crow  builders firstsource inc i think itll be a drag in q my concern right now on q is as we continue to buy to replenish and were kind of bumping up against our ability to reset prices with our customers our average cost is going to start creeping up and so thats the biggest concern i have for q its not a quantity issue whether were going to run out of lumber its just the timing of our buys versus our ability to reset prices nicholas andrew coppola  thompson research group llc okay all right and then i guess ill shift gears here so you talked a bit more about your greenfield strategy i saw five new manufacturing facilities and one new millwork facility for  so what is your decisionmaking process look like there and then how you think about greenfields versus ma over the longerterm m chad crow  builders firstsource inc well greenfield versus ma largely boils down to – we get feedback from our folks out in the field on whether theyre seeing the demand for example a truss plant and where we dont have one as you look at that market you determine are there any acquisition opportunities that maybe we have discussions with so as jim said earlier its a buy versus build decision at that point and if there are no candidates in the market or none that are willing to sell then you would turn to greenfielding but generally that process starts with our operators out in the field coming to us and saying hey i really feel like we have an
