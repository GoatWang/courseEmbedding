sears roebuck and co  beverly rd hoffman estates il  in  martinez enrolled in the harvard business school and earned an mba in  the lessons he learned at harvard were vital to his later work experiences in particular martinez recalled in his autobiography that the most important lesson was that myopia is fatal think boldly about what business you are in think carefully about what customers you are serving now and how you will meet the needs of the customers of the next generation while in school martinez and a friend also published a small magazine to support themselves in  martinez married elizabeth rusch and the couple later had a son and a daughter together gained corporate experience martinezs first job after harvard was for enjay chemical which later became exxon after learning that career advancement in the chemical industry would be slow martinez became the director of planning for new ventures for international paper in new york city in  two years later he moved to the mergers and acquisitions division of talley industries in arizona in  martinez accepted an offer as a director of business planning for rca record company in new york city four years later martinez was promoted to head the international division of rca when martinez was in business school he did not plan to build a career in the retail industry however in  he received an offer to become senior vice president and chief financial officer for saks fifth avenue martinez was interested in trying out retail as a new experience while at saks martinez learned that store personality was an important aspect of the business carving out that personality and making sure it was distinctive was crucial you had to understand that philosophy stay consistent with it and not vacillate martinez explained in his autobiography in  martinez accepted a promotion to senior vice president and group chief executive for batus inc the parent company of saks fifth avenue for nearly four years martinez worked in louisville kentucky running the retail businesses of saks marshall fields iveys department stores and breuners saks was eventually sold to investcorp and martinez was invited to return to saks in new york city in  as a vice chairman martinez became unhappy with the intrusive management style of investcorp so he eventually left saks in  martinez had lined up a new job with swiss company pa bergner which owned bergners in milwaukee and carson pirie scott in chicago he was going to help bergner out of bankruptcy when he got a call from herb mines an executive headhunter while vacationing in maine mines informed martinez that sears roebuck and co wanted to talk with him about helping their flailing company martinez was reluctant to consider the offer with sears because he already had a verbal agreement to join bergner however after a visit from sears ceo ed brennan who assured martinez that he would have the authority and money to make major changes at sears martinez accepted the challenge to reinvent one of americas best known department stores there were only two reasons not to take the job martinez told john mccormick of newsweek either it couldnt be done or i couldnt do it revamped sears in  martinez became the chairman and ceo of the sears merchandise group sears started as a watch company in  founded by richard w sears and alvah curtis roebuck which quickly grew into a business supplying a wide variety of products the core of the company was the sears catalog that targeted rural america which did most of its shopping by mail in the s sears became a retail store under the leadership of robert elkington wood for the next several decades sears adapted to changes in american life such as the growth of cities and the spread of automobiles and to changes in the american consumer and the company flourished according to martinez in the hard road to the softer side sears became the business model for bigstore retailing it was offering the right products in the right places at the right prices however in the s and s sears began to suffer financially the company had begun selling banking services insurance real estate and stocks instead of focusing on what it did best which was selling merchandise the company made two mistakes which were nearly fatal first and foremost sears had ignored its customers the company that was built around the idea of being in touch with its customers had abandoned them second sears lost track of its competition discount stores such as kmart and walmart as well as specialty stores such as home depot and circuit city were luring customers away from traditional department stores like sears in the year that martinez joined sears the company had lost  billion and  billion of that amount came from the merchandising department it would be presumptuous to say i knew exactly what i was going to do when i walked in the door but it was pretty clear that dramatic action was called for it was not a situation where incremental improvement was going to be sufficient martinez told terry savage of the chicago suntimes about the state of sears when he joined the company within the first one hundred days in his new position martinez made some dramatic changes at sears the company had already sold many of its other businesses such as banking and real estate which allowed martinez to focus on retail his first decision was to end the venerable sears catalog which had been in circulation for over  years while it was a sentimental favorite among the sears employees the catalog was losing  billion annually additionally martinez closed  stores and laid off  people martinez was quickly dubbed the man who killed the catalog and the ax from saks but he was convinced that these tough decisions were necessary to save the company martinez also focused on changing the corporate culture at sears which had contributed to the companys poor performance martinez aimed to make managers accountable for how well their particular areas performed he replaced the  page sears rule book with a new and simpler mission we wanted sears to be compelling to work for to shop at and to invest in martinez explained in his autobiography he also invested in improving the companys infrastructure particularly with respect to communications and computers found the softer side of sears the most important aspect of martinezs restructuring plan was returning the companys attention to the customer martinez analyzed data about sears customers and their lifestyles while sears had traditionally been considered a mans store that sold tools car batteries and lawn mowers martinez discovered that most of sears customers were actually women if women were making all of those buying decisions if they had indeed become the chief financial officers of the american family why were we continuing to ignore their needs their desires and their dreams my own suspicion was that we just didnt know how to talk to them and had not created a store that was warming or at all intriguing for them martinez explained in his autobiography in response to this revelation martinez hired the advertising firm of young and rubicam to target women as sears customers they developed the slogan the softer side of sears and the accompanying advertisements to appeal to female customers martinezs strategies for restructuring sears were successful from  to  sears sales increased  percent and earnings nearly tripled sears downsizing caused a lot of pain and suffering but the  billion retailer is on firmer footing today wrote scott mcmurray of us news  world report in may of  martinez was credited for sears turnaround and he became ceo of sears roebuck and co in  after ed brennan retired in  martinez was given the ceo of the year award by financial world magazine while martinez enjoyed his successes at sears he also recognized that the restructuring job was not over yet our situation is not unlike building the first half of a bridge martinez explained to barry l rupp of financial world in april of  when youre over the deepest part of the river its no time to take momentum for granted martinez planned to turn sears into a consumerbrands and services company he wanted to focus on sears name brands such as craftsman kenmore and die hard he also initiated a move away from big malls to building smaller sears specialty stores in  he introduced sears home central as a single source for all household services such as appliance repairs and pest control faced more challenges before retirement the turnaround of sears was not a straight road to success along the way the company suffered some financial setbacks however by the end of the s it was clear that sears was better off than it had been at the beginning of the decade in  and  the company faced a new round of challenges as apparel sales declined the company also experienced problems with credit card delinquencies and more employees were laid off martinez had a new strategy to turn sales around recognizing the growing business of internet shopping the company launched searscom to meet the needs of a new type of customer sears also opened up the great indoors chain offering upscale home decor and remodeling in  martinez announced his plans to retire from sears although he enjoyed his work at sears and the company still needed to work on staying competitive and profitable martinez wanted to retire at the age of  so that he could enjoy his retirement while he was still in good health and so he could spend time with his grandchildren martinez was replaced by alan lacy president of services at sears since his retirement martinez has continued to serve on the board of directors of several companies including martha stewart living and liz claiborne martinez spent eight years at sears overhauling the companys corporate culture infrastructure marketing and merchandising he redefined the role of the traditional department store for the s and made sears a profitable company after nearly two decades of decline when asked about his secret to success by terry savage of the chicago suntimes in april of  martinez explained that success will not be driven by your board scores and your grade point average coming out of school theyll be driven by your character and your intensity and by your willingness and
