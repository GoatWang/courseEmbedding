investment in the shares of the trust before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risk factors and other information included in the prospectus the value of the shares of

applicable margin requirements for those index future positions index futures are exchangetraded index future contracts on the sp gscier and may include contracts of different terms and expirations over time commodities markets have historically been extremely volatile the trading of commodity futures contracts may be illiquid in addition suspensions or disruptions of market trading in the

less than their nav the nav will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the trust’s assets and market supply and demand brokerage commissions and fees will reduce returns although shares of the trust may be bought or sold on the exchange through any brokerage account shares of the trust are not redeemable from the trust except in one or more blocks of  units called baskets only institutions that become authorized participants may purchase or redeem baskets shares of the trust may not provide the anticipated benefits of diversification from other asset classes the lack of an active trading market for the shares may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares diversification may not protect against market risk the trust issues shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets please note that since the shares of the trust are expected to reflect the price of commodities as described more fully in the prospectus held by the trust the market price of the shares will be as unpredictable as the price of those commodities have historically been the price received upon the sale of shares of the trust which trade at market price may be more or less than the value of the commodities represented by them if an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares for a more complete discussion of risk factors relative to the trust carefully read the prospectus following an investment in the trust several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of the commodities and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares among them i a change in economic conditions such as a recession can adversely affect the price of the commodities these commodities are used in a wide range of industrial applications and an economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and consequently its price and the price of the trust ii a significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards the commodities should the speculative community take a negative view towards the commodities a decline in world commodities prices could occur negatively impacting the price of the trust iii a significant increase in the commodity price hedging activity
