of  million or  per diluted share for the second quarter of  the second quarter of  included a pretax gain of   aftertax or  per diluted share from the sale of the companys remaining availableforsale debt securities portfolio excluding this item net income was  million or  per diluted share for the second quarter of   as first disclosed in a form q as filed with the securities and exchange commission on may   the company’s management investment committee approved a change in strategy to liquidate its externally managed availableforsale debt securities portfolio which largely consisted of corporate debt securities during the second quarter as continued rising interest rates would likely negatively impact the returns of this portfolio over time this portfolio had a carrying value of  million at the end of the first quarter  the company intends to ultimately invest approximately  million of the proceeds from the sale of these bonds in its internally managed fixed income securities portfolio which is accounted for as held to maturity and most of this liquidation and reinvestment had been accomplished by the end of the second quarter  the remaining proceeds were used to fund incremental loan growth the first quarter of  included a pretax gain of  million  million aftertax or  per diluted share from the companys investment in northeast retirement services inc which was acquired by community bank system inc a pretax loss of  million  aftertax or  per diluted share from the sale of the companys investments in mutual funds and the reversal of a valuation allowance for

income of  million or  per diluted share for the six months ended june   see page  for a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap measures commenting on the companys results william parent president and chief executive officer of blue hills bancorp said the first half of  was an important period in the continued transformation of our bank  we took some key steps to restructure our securities portfolio by selling our portfolio of mutual fund investments in the first quarter and restructuring of the remaining portfolio of availableforsale debt securities in the second quarter  these actions will reduce volatility in our quarterly financial statements and together with the expansion of our loan portfolio over the past several years have reduced the level of investment securities to just  of total assets at june    as recently as the end of  investment securities comprised approximately onethird of the companys total assets parent continued all of our businesses have performed well in  as earnings per share from core operations more than doubled in the first half of  from the comparable period in   mortgage originations and revenues continued to climb reflecting the successful and continued expansion of that business our commercial lending teams have generated strong loan growth and our retail banking team has done a great job bringing in deposits  the three branches we have opened since the fourth quarter of  have a combined deposit total of  million at june   while our division in nantucket which was acquired in early  ended the second quarter with  million in deposits revenues excluding securities gains and nonrecurring items grew  in the second quarter compared to the year ago period and importantly much of the investment spending that gave rise to the revenue improvement is behind us  the significant growth in revenue from the second quarter of last year was accompanied by a relatively modest  increase in noninterest expense and this has provided us with significant positive operating leverage while reducing our efficiency ratio to  in the second quarter from  a year ago  we just crossed the three year anniversary of our mutual to stock conversion and are proud of the progress the company has made  we look forward to the future with enthusiasm and to creating value for our stakeholders balance sheetcompared to march   total assets grew  million or  to  billion at june    the increase was driven by loan growth as total loans increased  million or  to  billion at june    by category the increase was mainly driven by commercial real estate loans which were up  million or  and commercial business loans which were up  million or   residential mortgage loans were little changed as growth from new originations was offset by loan sales  in addition to the increase in loans shortterm investments were up  million or   these increases were partially offset by an  million or  decline in the combination of securities availableforsale and held to maturity reflecting the aforementioned sale of the remaining availableforsale debt securities portfolio and the partial reinvestment of those proceeds into securities classified as held to maturity  at june    of all securities and  of all debt securities are classified as held to maturity compared to june   total assets increased  million or   loans also drove the growth in total assets in this comparison increasing  million or  by category the increase from june   was due to residential mortgage loans which were up  million or  commercial real estate loans which were up  million or  and commercial business loans which were up  million or   residential mortgage loan originations were  million in the second quarter of  compared to  million in the second quarter of  as the expanded origination team continued to grow the business and gain market share in the second quarter of  commercial loans real estate and nonreal estate combined totaling  million were added to the balance sheet compared to  million in the second quarter of   the growth in loans was partially offset by a  million or  decline in the combination of securities availableforsale and held to maturity due to the previously discussed sales of the mutual fund investment portfolio and the remaining availableforsale debt securities portfolio compared to march   deposits grew  million or  to  billion at june   mainly reflecting growth in municipal deposits and brokered certificates of deposit  deposits at the companys newest branch which was opened in the fourth quarter of  and is located in the seaport district of boston grew  million during the second quarter to  million at june    the companys branch in westwood which was opened in the fourth quarter of  surpassed the  million mark in deposits during the second quarter  borrowings declined to  million at june   from  million at march   due to the sale of the remaining availableforsale debt securities portfolio and a shift in wholesale funding to a higher level of brokered certificates of deposit compared to june   deposits grew  million or  and included growth in all customer segments consumer small business commercial

equity was  million at june   and march   compared to  million at june   the increase from a year ago was mainly due to net income over the past four quarters which added  million to stockholders

adjustment     reported net interest margin fte     mutual fund dividends —    purchase accounting accretion accelerated bond amortizationaccretion on note redemptions— — —  adjusted net interest margin fte        management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte using a federal statutory tax rate of  a statutory tax rate of  was used prior to the fourth quarter of  therefore management believes these measures provide useful information to investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons note in calculating the net interest margin impact of mutual fund dividends and purchase accounting accretion average earning assets were adjusted to remove the average balances associated with each item in quarters where mutual fund dividend income is low the removal of the dividend and its related average balance has a positive impact on the adjusted net interest margin  management believes this adjusted net interest margin is useful because of the volatility or nonrecurring nature of certain items from quarter to quarter the company sold its investments in mutual funds during the first quarter of   adjusted net interest and dividend income on a fully tax equivalent basis increased  or  to  million in the second quarter of  from  million in the first quarter of  and was up  million or  from  million in the second quarter of   adjusted net interest margin improved to  in the second quarter of  from  in the first quarter of  and  in the second quarter of   adjusted net interest income and net interest margin benefited in both comparisons from higher floating rate loan yields related to the interest rate increases announced by the federal reserve bank in june  march  and december   the company maintains an asset sensitive interest rate risk position  in addition adjusted net interest income was helped by loan growth as average loans increased  million or  from the first quarter of this year and  million or  from the second quarter of last year  in both comparisons average loan growth was driven by higher levels of commercial real estate loans residential mortgages and commercial business loans  partially offsetting the improvement from loan growth was a decline in average securities which were down  million or  from the first quarter and  million or  from last years second quarter  these declines reflected the sales of the mutual fund investment portfolio and the remaining portfolio of availableforsale debt securities  noninterest incomenoninterest income was  million in the second quarter of  down from  million in the first quarter of   the second quarter includes a  gain on the sale of the companys remaining availableforsale debt securities portfolio while the first quarter included a gain of  million from the companys investment in northeast retirement services inc which was acquired by community bank system inc and a  million loss from the sale of the companys investments in mutual funds excluding these items noninterest income was  million in the second quarter of  up  million or  from the first quarter of   the improvement is due to a  million increase in loan level derivative income related to the portfolio of commercial loan customer interest rate swap contracts the amount of revenue in the loan level derivative income category can be volatile since it is a function of the amount of commercial loans that customers opt to convert from floating to fixed rate via interest rate swaps in any given quarter  also contributing to the increase was a  improvement in mortgage banking income reflecting a higher level of loan sale gains compared to the second quarter of  noninterest income increased  million or  as noted previously the second quarter of  includes a  gain on the sale of the companys remaining availableforsale debt securities portfolio however the second quarter of  also includes  of securities gains  excluding securities gains the improvement was driven by the same factors that caused the increase in the linked quarter comparison  loan level derivative income was up  million and mortgage banking income grew  noninterest expensenoninterest expense was  million in the second and first quarters of  compared to  million in the second quarter of   the  or  increase from the second quarter of last year is mainly due to franchise growth and this can mainly be seen in the salaries and benefits as well as the occupancy and equipment expense categories  the new seaport branch as well as the opening of new loan and mortgage production offices contributed to the growth in both salaries and benefits expense and occupancy and equipment expense asset qualitythe provision for loan losses which in all quarters reflects management’s assessment of risks inherent in the loan portfolio was  million in the second quarter of  compared to  in the first quarter of  and  million in the second quarter of   loan growth and loan mix impact the level of provision needed each quarter and the increase in the provision from the first quarter reflected both factors  loan growth was higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter and there was a change in loan mix during the second quarter with commercial real estate loans becoming a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio and residential mortgages becoming a lower percentage the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was  at june   compared to  at march   and  june   the decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans from a year ago was impacted by the general improvement in historical loss rates from national fdic data as well as the planned migration of loss rates to those more reflective of the companys own loan loss experience  the company had net loan chargeoffs of  in the second quarter of  compared to net loan recoveries of  in the first quarter of  and net loan chargeoffs of  in the second quarter of    nonperforming assets were  million at june   compared to  million at march   and  million at june    the decline from a year ago was mainly due to the chargeoff of one commercial credit in the third quarter of last year  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was  at june   compared to  at march   and  at june
