to other schools in the state ratings can change for a variety of reasons including changes in assessments or changes in rating methodology because the underlying data and methodology can vary over time comparing past ratings to current ones may not accurately reflect changes in the school’s quality if we are missing a rating year it’s most likely because we did not receive the underlying data from the state department of education for that year and so did not compute a rating good news test scores at this school are far above the state average suggesting that most students at this school

for truth in credit reports free consultation    6 660 false information on your credit reports get a free consultation from a legal pro when you’ve got false or outdated information on your credit reports or other consumer reports it’s hard to know where to turn  there’s a lot of hype these days on the internet tv and elsewhere about credit reports and credit scores  lots of companies are happy to take your money but what are you really getting when you need to cut through all the noise and want to talk to an experienced attorney about what your rights really are and what you can affordably do about them contact the goolsby law office llc for a free consultation  we’ll figure out together if a fair credit reporting act lawsuit is right for you  if we can’t help you we’ll try to set you on the right track don’t let your rights slide  contact us today for a free consultation think you can’t afford an attorney  we don’t want your money not only is your initial consultation free but even if we take your case you won’t ever have to come up with money to pay us  the goolsby law office llc believes that innocent people who have been wronged by false information on their credit reports shouldn’t have to pay for justice  and congress agrees  the credit reporting law says that if the consumer wins a lawsuit the lawbreakers have to pay not only for the harm they caused but also for the consumer’s attorney’s time  that means that if we decide to take your case you don’t have to pay for our work unless there’s a recovery and you only have to pay us out of the money recovered it gets better  if you have a good case you may stand to get money what’s the catch  a good case for false credit reporting has to involve credit reporting that really is false  you can’t bring a lawsuit based on accurate recent information that really belongs to you   want to get accurate recent information that really belongs to you off your credit reports sorry we can’t help with that – and you should beware of credit repair companies that claim they can they’ll be happy to take your money but it’s probably a scam  at the goolsby law office llc we’re willing to fight – but only for the truth   have you been ripped off by a credit repair company we sue them too  contact the goolsby law office llc for a free consultation     nothing on this website should be construed as legal advice
