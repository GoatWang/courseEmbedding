comments to this article go here neelie kroes statement on microsoft fine q  a  transcript wednesday february     pm est sean daly took the time to transcribe the neelie kroes statement to the press and the q  a afterward from the video regarding the microsoft fine announced earlier today thank you sean however for anything that matters go by the video this is not an official transcript and although we strive for accuracy we cant guarantee it if anyone notices any mistakes please let me know so we can perfect it it is absolutely fascinating my favorite part is her promise that consumers can rely upon it that they will have a choice jonathan todd good morning ladies and gentlemen competition commissioner neelie kroes is here to talk to you about the decision taken this morning by the commission on microsoft after her introductory remarks wed of course be very pleased to take your questions  neelie kroes good morning everybody today the european commission has imposed a substantial fine  to be precise  million euros  on microsoft for its noncompliance up until the nd october of  with its obligations under the commissions march  decision as you are aware to provide interoperability information on reasonable terms todays decision finds that prior to the nd of october  microsoft charged unreasonable prices for access to indispensable interoperability information in plain english this is to say that microsoft continued to abuse its powerful market position  our march  decision requiring it to change that practice microsoft continued to stifle innovation how by charging other companies prohibitive royalty rates for the essential information they needed to offer software products to computer users around the world well charging such an unreasonable prices effectively rendered the offer of information pointless and microsofts behavior did not just harm a few individuals or a handful of big companies directly and indirectly this had negative effects on millions of offices in companies and governments around the world by the way it gives me no pleasure to be here again announcing such a fine nor to see that a company flouted the law when it had many opportunities to choose other courses of action but given the nature of microsofts noncompliance considering both its effects and its duration todays fine is proportionate and is necessary there are lessons that i hope microsoft and any other company contemplating similar illegal action will learn talk as you know is cheap flouting the rules is expensive so to say we dont want talk and promises we want compliance if you flout the rules you will be caught and it will cost you dear this is by the way the third time in four years that we have had to impose fines or penalty payments on microsoft the first fine as you remember was for the abuse itself everything up until march  then the commission had to impose a penalty payment in july  for the nondelivery of complete and accurate interoperability information and that was the first time that a penalty payment for noncompliance with a commission decision had been necessary in fifty years of ec competition law and finally todays penalty payment for unreasonable royalty rates up until october  that the commission has been forced to levy these three fines reflects a clear disregard by microsoft of its legal obligations the commissions fine is a reasonable response to a series of quite unreasonable actions so to say microsoft has gone from insisting on charging a  royalty for nonpatented interoperability information to charging a flat fee of  euros for the same information finally after three years of illegal behavior it appears that microsoft has come into compliance with the  decision todays decision and penalty payment are about the  decision only and are not about any of microsofts other business practices and i must stress ladies and gentlemen that distinction in the clearest possible terms and you will of course be aware that the commission opened two antitrust inquiries in january looking at several of microsofts other practices and as you are aware one concerns interoperability information across a broad range of products including microsofts office suite and a number of its server products and the other concerns tying of internet explorer and other separate software products with the microsoft pc operating system those investigations are separate and continuing and i can offer no comment until the investigation is complete but you are not expecting any comment on that one as always we will take into account any changes that microsoft makes to its business practices that are relevant to those investigations we take positive changes to business practices very seriously but again and i stress that a press release in itself such as that issued by microsoft last week on interoperability principles does not necessarily equal a change in a business practice and if change is needed  and as i say i have reached no conclusion on that  then the change will need to be in the market not in the rhetoric we do have some experience on that to finish i think it is important to share a little insight into our consistent approach to illegal behavior its not my job to tell people or to tell companies what to buy but it is my job to ensure they have a choice about what they can buy competition policy is about making sure that people and companies have the right to choose and when people and companies are given that right to choose then markets deliver so much more  and that is why i am passionate about making markets work better and todays decision sends again a strong signal that consumers can expect choice in europe and can expect the european commission to fight for their right to choice thank you  jonathan todd thank you commissioner well be taking questions on this decision of this morning  q commissioner you said yourself that the fine is quite substantial its nearly at twice as high as the fine in the procedure itself could you please elaborate on how the fine was calculated did it depend upon the time between the second fine and the third fine or is that completely independent of that  neelie kroes the answer is yes and if you take into account  million euros and if you take into account  days that this was done then its not that difficult to make your calculation by the way i still think that we made a very reasonable amount of money out of this penalty it is proportionate and i think that taking into account what we did its still the highest yes but it is  we could have done much higher  we could have done and that is perhaps interesting  we could have gone as far as  billion so to say so the maximum amount is higher than what we did at the end of the day so reasonable but sticking to our line they should behave like they have to  q fine on top of another fine is there any point in these figures are all these fines going to make any change to things for consumers  neelie kroes in the positive sense because fines are not intended to be at the service of taxpayers you know that the total quantity applies with these fines and penalty payments ultimately they go into a fund whereby taxpayers pay less to europe no this is a signal whereby we make it very clear that it is unacceptable if you dont abide by the rules just as in traffic if you dont stick to the rules in traffic then you get a fine its precisely the same for companies and by repeating reoffending we make it known and we take the duration into account as well im convinced that ultimately it is in the interest of the consumer that companies must respect our rules and list of conditions and conduct then theres better choice better quality for everyone thank you  q madame commissioner could you remind us of the total amount of all the fines that have been issued against microsoft and now if theyve been paid also asked an unrelated question  neelie kroes thank you for your question the total amount that microsoft owes us has to pay us is  billion euros so nearly  billion euros so to say so those are three fines together also response to unrelated question  q yeah could i just ask you said that you could have fined them up to  billion was that the  of relevant turnover were talking about or   i mean what proportion of turnover  somebodys shaking their head so clearly not i mean how is it calculated in other words what im trying to get at is how is it calculated and is it related to turnover or profits or what and the other thing is that given all these signals which theyve been sending you in your pleasant conversations youve had with steve ballmer in rotterdam in restaurants near rotterdam does it not seem to the outside world to be rather vindictive although its as youve given  youve taken no pleasure in imposing the fine  neelie kroes well that is my general answer to every fine i have to come to that its never pleasure for me the best day in office will be when there are zero fines so to say for that  but if we are doing the job properly and that having been said we are doing the job properly and all those in the outside world are behaving but i think that i need more than one term in office to get to that point so to say and im not believing that  and even with two terms in office i am nearly sure that that wont be the case having said that of course it is always our intention whatever company whatever nationality whatever member state is involved in that operation to come to a point that its clearcut for the company to behave and to follow the rules and regulations and that at the end of the day deserve that consumers issue what about the contacts with the ceo and by the way of course the contacts with the organization of microsoft and dg competition it is all to try to get a solution in which that not behaving conformed to the rules and regulations and the judgment of the court so to say that that will be translated into a better behaving and in a better position for innovative actions from also the competitors and for more diversity in the sector that having been said if the maximum amount that i was mentioning of the periodic penalty payments could have theoretically been fixed at  billion euros the actual fixed amount is just shy its  nothing to do with whatever contact and so on it has to do with the past taking into account the period so the number of days it has to do with the different phases in which they sometimes were moving a bit and this is at the end of the day the final account we came to and its perhaps useful to point out that the last article  decision in july  for microsofts failure to provide complete and accurate specifications imposed a much larger share of the possible maximum at that time it was  but again i think this is proportionate its reasonable and it should be a signal to the outside world and especially a signal to microsoft that we stick to our line  q commissioner talking about the size of the fine you said that the maximum possible fine would have been  billion euros im just intrigued given the size of microsoft given the length of time given the fact that its a repeat fine why did you decide to go for less than the full amount i mean its not as if microsoft cant afford it so why did you not go for the full amount why did you just go for the   neelie kroes that by the way may never ever be a line can someone afford yes or no is someone rich yes or no it is all in a fair but indeed a way that you can defend the end of the amount also to the outside world and rightly said by you they are not a company that is in bad shape so to say but that is exactly why we are interested in the company itself because they have to perform like the other ones have to perform and taking into account that their own revenue by the way in the market is over  billion euros per year in this continent then i think this is absolutely reasonable and you should take into account that the sky is not the limit for fines it is just to be explained that we are reasonable and they have to be reasonable on their terms  q you referred to microsofts announcement last week saying that the press communique was not sufficient that there would have to be fundamental changes are you still skeptical about that announcement and the announcement was made when you were discussing these fines today do you think that microsoft went too far in their announcement  neelie kroes well i pretend to be not naive and i am not in the mood to accept when someone is mentioning that talking about interoperability the policy will be changed first show me and then i am willing and hopefully able to say that is in line with what we are asking for by the way that communication was not about tying and as you are aware we do have two big issues in our discussion with microsoft so talk is cheap  and i was already mentioning that  lets wait and lets find the reality in this case and its not the first moment that they were announcing this we do have a couple of experiences i even can remember four times that you should  if you were naive  should have thought over that everything was fixed but it didnt seem to be reality so hopefully this will be the fifth time and that will be the case but they have to deliver and to implement

 shares next story bbc microbit learntocode device finally rolling out to uk schools one of the most powerful regulators in european tech in the last decade has found a landing place outside of the halls of brussels today crm giant salesforce announced that neelie kroes — a former vice president of the european commission european commissioner for competition and european commissioner for digital agenda — is joining its board of directors she is the second highprofile exgovernment figure to join the board in as many years following the appointment of general colin powell almost exactly two years ago — a sign of how the company continues to eye up the public sector for lucrative service contracts “we are delighted to have neelie kroes join our board of directors” said marc benioff chairman and ceo salesforce in a statement “she is an amazing and respected leader who has done extraordinary work at the highest levels of government technology policy and business ineurope salesforce will benefit greatly from her broad experience across both the public and private sectors” “salesforce is one of the world’s most admired companies and a leader in digital transformation for business” said neelie kroes “it’s an honor for me to serve on the salesforce board of directors” the appointment becomes effective on may  and brings the total number of people on salesforce’s board to  general powell was number  she will join a number of other highprofile people on the board including maynard webb chairman of yahoo inc and susan wojcicki ceo of youtube kroes will become the third woman on salesforce’s board adding kroes to salesforce’s board is interesting for a few reasons first the company is gaining a sharp mind and strong operative in the area of regulation which could help shape how a company like salesforce can exist within that framework kroes’ final role in the european commission was as its vice president and her previous roles as commissioners competition and digital agenda means that she was often sparring with large tech companies over antitrust issues but at the same time she was also enlisting them in the bigger efforts that she was leading to bring down the digital divide across europe and foster more tech development as a route to economic growth salesforce has mostly remained outside investigations at the ec level when it comes to antitrust issues see google and microsoft or issues of privacy see google and facebook but as one of the larger tech companies in the world it may not always escape that scrutiny before her roles at the ec level kroes was a longtime politician in her native netherlands second salesforce has been ramping up its presence in europe over the last several years both in terms of direct business and also expanding its ecosystem and so kroes’ appointment also underscores salesforce’s focus on this market among its activities the company last september announced a  million fund to invest in european cloud startups and separately to that salesforce ventures has been making direct investments in a number of more mature tech startups like newvoicemedia and qubit third this is also one more sign of how salesforce continues to eye up more lucrative contracts in the public sector this is something that we pointed out was already a large business area for the company in  when general powell joined the board having someone like kroes at the company also helps to extend salesforce’s credibility in this area as more businesses — and specifically government and public sector organizations — update their it assets and move their operations into the cloud salesforce is not the only big us tech company eyeing up how to expand its crm business with them last week ibm acquired a uk company called optevia that focuses on crm integrations for groups in this vertical optevia’s track record to date has been mainly focused on microsoft software and uk organizations — but ibm told me it plans to expand optevia’s reach to cover other vendors and other geographies kroes in the past has been on the boards of ab volvo ballast nedam mcdonald’s netherlands lucent netherlands po nedlloyd and nederlandse spoorwegen and was chairperson of nyenrode university kroes is also a member of the financial committee of the rijksmuseum salesforce says and she also serves as special envoy for startupdelta a publicprivate partnership to establish a thriving ecosystem of startup companies in the netherlands the full board at salesforce in addition to kroes after may  includes marc

investors with startupdelta january  january  bopeter startupdelta starting january th startup delta will take its first tour around the netherlands to host a series of  minihackathons to cocreate the online startup community ecosystems centered around startupdeltaorg the meetup session for the amsterdam community is already fully booked evidence of the excitement within the startup community around startupdelta lead by neelie kroes the program for each of the six meetups focus on gathering and providing information around four points position the netherlands as the country for startups within europe attract fast growing tech startups talent investors and corporate innovation teams from foreign countries inform dutch as well as foreign startups about all aspects relevant for business support create a community for all players within our dutch startup ecosystem while the initiative seeks out to position the netherlands as the startup hub for europe there is a key point that these meetups are not addressing the lack of available capital in the netherlands one doesn’t need to look far for evidence of dutch startups falling apart due to lack of funding ie online catering business vanchefs news site startupjuncture detailed all the funding raised by dutch startups in  totaling up to € million across  companies as startupjuncture notes this is something to be proud of among us dutch but to achieve the ambitions of startupdelta to attract foreign startups and investors to the netherlands much more is necessary the reinvestment cycle source startup capital ventures   there is abundant wealth in the netherlands in order to create the reinvestment cycle that is character of silicon valley for successful startups startupdelta should focus on creating new sources of investment from experienced business people who can become angel investors and from big brand names that are able to make big investments venture capital firms will also need to mature but do more to raise capital for their funds to understand more of why these funding structures are necessary to create leading startup scene in europe looking at the lifecycle of startups will provide more insight the startup life cycle the startup life cycle source netvalley my favorite definition of a startup runs along these lines “a startup is a company which has yet to find a scalable business model” while some say a startup is a state of mind the purpose of my definition is to take into account the monetary aspect of startup companies most startups seek this scalable model as they develop or have developed a product or service ready for the market however where most startups encounter problems is a region in the life cycle known as the “valley of death” typically speaking companies need capital during this time in order to survive until it turns a profit and create and refine its scalable model more than capital founders need mentoring cue the angel investors getting to the breakeven point is no easy affair and even then achieving a scalable model for sustainable growth is hard work however once the startup creates a scalable model the company needs to grow too seed rounds and venture capital will support the company team to expand in order scale out the product or service and eventually the maturity in which the company no longer really refers to itself as a startup startupdelta exists as a concentrated effort by the ministry of economics to support startups because the ministry recognizes the potential for small young companies to make a big impact if the goal of creating a startup ecosystem is to be realized capital must be available startupdelta must create the reinvestment cycle to achieve its goals startupdelta will surely boost the netherlands startup community and the goals they’ve set as outlined above will help accomplish that nonetheless an emphasis on making capital available to startups need to be present the startupdelta tour across the netherlands will set the stage for neelie kroes and it is without a doubt of great importance as these meetups take place to cocreate the community portals those present must focus on how to stimulate the netherlands’ normally conservative fiscal sentiment into investing in risky startups my suggestion is to build a place for startups and investors to seriously meet and find each other but beyond that convince experienced business people with enough personal liquid assets to become angel investors furthermore existing and future venture capital firms in the netherlands will need help raising money for their funds startupdelta can help here too ambitious entrepreneurs with talent and innovation are building startups and get great support from accelerators and knowledge centers who are the main partners of startupdelta too the next step in creating the reinvestment cycle for the startup ecosystem is to help these startups find their scalable model and reap profits what comes next is hallmark of silicon valley companies grow big go public and profits are made for the startup its angels and the vcs they go back to invest in new startups when this happens startupdelta will succeed in making the netherlands the startup ecosystem of europe we want it to be bopeter is operations of benelux for laanen the brand and also has his own blog at blaanencom contact him via twitter blaanen
