natural places for some pests to thrive the most problematic kitchen pests are cockroachesunsavory creatures that disgust nearly everyone many people mistakenly believe that only dirty people get cockroaches but this is a myth every home or commercial kitchen has the potential to have a cockroach problem once a cockroach infestation gets started its severity is usually determined by the resources available for cockroach survivalfood water and harborage ie hiding places the biggest cockroach problems are often in homes where there is a clutter problem because the more stuff people have especially in the kitchen the more hiding places for roaches but clean neat and tidy kitchens can still have roaches for example cockroaches can hide underneath the labels of canned goods and eat the paste off the labels because cockroaches tend to frequent garbage cans sewers and other diseaseladen locations germs attach to their body that can transfer to food contact surfaces utensils plates during the normal course of roach activities these include diseasecausing bacteria salmonella shigella e coli streptococcus pneumonia several helminths hookwoorm pinworms tapeworms and even viruses poliomyelitis if this hasnt convinced you they are bad to live with cockroaches also produce a powerful allergen that causes allergies and asthma the biggest problem in us kitchens is the german cockroach blattella germanica it is a small cockroach with two distinctive longitudinal es just behind its head the german cockroach requires moisture regularly has a high reproductive rate and is small enough to live in small cracks and crevices infestations are often at their worst in the late summer months how to control roaches step  ensure you are practicing proper sanitation techniques in your home • never leave sources of food or water exposed clean up spills immediately do not leave pet water and food out  hours a day during the daytime you can place your pet’s dish in a plate filled with soapy water because soap has some insecticidal properties roaches venturing into the water will be killed • keep food in tightly sealed plastic or glass containers rather than in paper or cardboard containers that the roaches can chew through • regularly clean around and beneath appliances sinks and other locations close to a food source where dark andor humid conditions exist a layer of accumulated grease behind a stove will allow several adult roaches to survive and reproduce empty drainage pans under refrigerators to eliminate this source of water for the roaches • clean the kitchen thoroughly every day • store garbage in sealed plastic containers and dispose of it daily • do not allow dirty dishes to accumulate especially overnight if you do not have the time to wash them immediately immerse them in a strong solution of detergent and water • vacuum your home regularly to help remove food particles and insect egg masses • wrap or insulate pipes that have excessive amounts of condensation repair leaky faucets and pipes ventilate rooms and dehumidify areas of excess moisture to reduce availability of water from these sources controlling humidity and increasing the light and air circulation in problem areas will help control infestations step  use the right professional products the standard method of treating for cockroaches has been to spray insecticides on baseboards and in cupboards with the hope that cockroaches will crawl across the band of dried insecticide and the residue left from the application will  we now know that this type of treatment is not very effective reasons why include • cockroaches do not live behind baseboards but live in dark damp locations near food and water sources efforts to locate and treat these hiding places are much more effective • insecticides are not  percent effective and unless efforts are made to reduce food water and harborage populations of the prolific german cockroach are likely to rebound • cockroaches species including the german cockroach have developed insecticidal resistance to many insecticides • most insecticidal sprays especially aerosol treatments dont have much residual activity this is also true of bomb type applications it is possible to eradicate cockroaches but effort and persistence must be greater than their reproductive rate to be successful a multitactic approach must be used this means not relying on a single strategy like sprays but using several types of control tactics • sanitation efforts alone eliminating food water harborage may not be enough to eliminate a cockroach problem but will reduce the population and make other control efforts work better getting rid of clutter is extremely important eliminating water and food will make roaches move farther to obtain them and come into contact with baits and other control tactics • cleaning cupboards and underaround appliances is important keep a vacuum cleaner handy vacuuming roaches is an easy way to make a dent in the population just be sure to take the vacuum cleaner bag outside afterwards • because roaches usually travel pretty close to where they hide use sticky traps glue boards to see where roaches are hiding replace them when the surface is covered with roaches over time glue boards will indicate how well controls are working and identify new infestations the biggest improvement in controlling cockroaches in recent years is the availability of effective bait products they are available in small plastic containers bait stations or as a dispensable gel baits use fipronil hydamethylnon boric acid or abamectin as their active ingredient use gel baits best or bait stations in areas where roaches are caught on sticky traps bait areas where roach specks are found—these are locations where roaches spend a lot of time other low toxic approaches include • use boric acid dusts in wall voids or under appliances when used alone boric acid isnt terribly effective but a good supplementary treatment when roaches walk through the dust it sticks to their body they ingest it as they groom themselves and it is a slowacting stomach poison • dusts of silica dioxide or diatomaceous earth kill roaches by abrading their waxy cuticle and desiccating them use these in wall voids • use cold or hot temperatures to kill roaches if roaches get into electronic appliances bag
