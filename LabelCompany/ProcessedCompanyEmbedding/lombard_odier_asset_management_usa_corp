globalisation by john arlidge wednesday  september  contact us the world changed forever on  june  when the british public voted to leave the european union eu after more than  years the immediate fallout was extreme global stock markets tumbled while the pound plummeted to a year low much of this initial reaction has since been reversed with european stock markets including the ftse  rebounding to prereferendum levels but with years of exit negotiations ahead the brexit effect is far from over following are just two views on what is an extraordinarily multifaceted subject the picture may still be developing but it’s already time to “rethink brexit” brexit globalisation the uk’s historic vote to leave the european union opened debate in all parts of the world on the cracks in the philosophy of a european community what impact does brexit still to have on our markets globalisation is good or rather it used to be britain’s “brexit” vote to leave the european union is making many rethink the liberal economic order many britons voted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc in protest at the free movement of people and money that they blame for impoverishing them and making it harder for them to find school places for their children and hospital appointments for their family their action has encouraged others most notably in europe and the us where antipathy towards globalisation crosses the political spectrum as isolationist sentiment grows its impact is beginning to be felt in the markets one of the reasons why sterling fell in value by around  after the brexit vote in june is that investors believe britain will be a less competitive economy outside the integrated eu economy and the eurozone beyond europe figures from the world trade organisation wto show that export growth among developing countries fell to a meagre  in   a precipitous decline from more than  in  in july  the imf slashed its forecast for global trade growth for the umpteenth time this year will be the sixth year in a row that world trade has been flat or falling as a share of the global economy  after decades when trade was rising faster than the world economy and the engine of prosperity for emerging market economies small wonder that many are now calling time on an economic order that has endured since the latter half of the last century martin wolf now questions whether capitalism and liberal democracy might turn out to be incompatible capitalism and liberal democracy might turn out to be incompatible the good news for those who believe that free global trade is a longterm net win for trading partners and for global prosperity is that while some western governments and voters may want to detach from an interconnected world others are forging ahead while some western governments and voters may want to detach from an interconnected world others are forging ahead wto figures show that while overall export growth among developing countries may be slowing trade between developing nations is rising sharply some  of developing countries’ exports went to other emerging economies in  up from   years ago trade between china and india was bn in  by  it had reached bn india’s total trade with africa grew more than  in only four years to almost bn in  chinese companies invested bn around the world in   more than ten times the amount in  figures from the american enterprise institute show the total that indian companies have invested abroad  bn in   has risen  in the past five years what’s more there are signs of a rearguard action by the liberal market brigade french  yes french  economy minister emmanuel macron has resigned from the government the yearold former investment banker is expected to run for the presidency under a prointegration pro open markets banner polls in france show also support for eu rising since brexit vote in the spanish general election that took place just after the brexit referendum support for the mainstream centre right rose while the radical fringe lost support there are signs of a rearguard action by the liberal market brigade perhaps the shock of brexit has given the supporters of globalisation just the jolt they needed it is some  small  comfort for “bremain” supporters if their loss turns out to be globalisations gain  samy chaar on brexit by jessica bown wednesday  september  lombard odier’s chief economist samy chaar believes the shortterm impact of the brexit vote on global stock markets has already been erased but that the ongoing uncertainty is a serious risk what impact has the result of the european union eu referendum had on european stock markets what impact has the result of the european union eu referendum had on european stock markets global markets all went down on the morning after the vote however if you look at any european index now they are all trading back at above june levels in other words the effect has been completely erased what impact do you expect it to have longer term europe currently provides  of foreign investment into the uk so brexit could be a real game changer for the uk economy european markets may also be affected if other eu countries vote to leave the union but this seems unlikely at this stage does brexit threaten london’s status as a financial hub the short answer is yes of the  major banks in the city more than two thirds are foreign and a big chunk are there to operate in europe however cities such as paris and frankfurt are not ready to replace london as europe’s main financial hub so it is not the end of the city as we know it do you believe brexit will have political ramifications elsewhere in the world internationally antiestablishment sentiment is pushing people towards political extremes but while there is exasperation with the eu in other european countries these countries have stronger ties to the union not least because they have the euro even in italy there is little appetite to return to the lira what do you expect to happen to uk interest rates short term i do not expect uk interest rates to change however sterling has taken a hit and the uk has very little manufacturing the higher cost of imports will therefore drive inflation creating another problem for the bank of england what effect will brexit have on real estate in the uk lower interest rates are good news for property investors – and the depreciation of the pound acts as a cushion but the prime london property market is dependent on investment from europe russia and the middle east so there is vulnerability especially as these properties are so overvalued what are the biggest risks facing investors during the exit negotiations uncertainty is the undoubtedly the biggest issue for investors at this time it’s going to be a long process and for the uk a lot depends on the economic model put forward by theresa may we should have a better idea of what she is planning after the autumn statement on  november  what can investors do to protect themselves against the risks linked to brexit investors should think on a global scale and seek exposure to countries that will not be impacted by this issue emerging markets are one example of this they are volatile but could provide a  yield our view is to have a wellbalanced portfolio that preserves your capital and gives you a little something on top what investment opportunities may arise from brexit one possibility is that as the balance of power in europe shifts the eurozone – rather than the eu which is bigger and less flexible – will wield greater international power previous next read more on lombard odier perspectives sector update  brexit  positioning for brexit what next for the banks read more could brexit be the unexpected

number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many factors get help deciding by answering a few questions here a specialist is here to

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
