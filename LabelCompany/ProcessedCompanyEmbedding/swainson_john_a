today due to the accounting for ma mergers and acquisitions but to be relevant in dell we need to become a bn software business in terms of revenue and that is the path i am focused on” he says it is a path that swainson admits will not be travelled quickly enough if left solely to organic growth his goal is for dell software to make up  of the companys revenue and contribute roughly  of its operational income given the high margins associated with a software business compared with hardware and services  he is not prepared to estimate how long this journey will take as it depends on dells ma activity that journey is underway thanks to swainson acquiring a number of major companies for dell including quest software and sonicwall along with a few smaller ones dells software business employs  people and contributes bn  to dells 7bn annual revenue we can grow organically and inorganically in the software business with doubledigit growth john swainson dell software seeking sizeable rewards in software in a fastchanging market where demand for pc refreshes is plummeting the business recognised that it needed to integrate products and solutions and move away from hardware in favour of software and services he says swainson believes the market will eventually figure out where pcs fit against tablet computers so dells end user computing business will see modest growth  he expects the enterprise business to grow by  the services business is expected to grow in single digits since it represents a peopleheavy division and will be limited by how quickly dell can hire  for swainson software represents the golden ticket for dell we think we can grow organically and inorganically in the software business with doubledigit growth” he adds the challenge for swainson and michael dell is that software acquisitions are not attractive to investors public companies have to take a big cut on deferred revenue which makes it difficult to make a software acquisition profitable in the short term but swainsons track record particularly at ibm where he oversaw the eclipse open source project adds credibility and experience to dells turnaround plans read more on dell

virtual domains cloud computing is part of dells software story but swainson says it will not offer a public cloud  we did experiment with a dell public cloud but from that experiment we discovered the economics are not favourable he says dell is in the process of migrating people off its cloud he adds although companies that do not wish to migrate will be able to stay until the end of their contract dells cloud strategy is as a supplier “we are a supplier to cloud providers offering hardware and software to people who want to build private and public clouds and hosting services” says swainson recent revelations around the prism surveillance programme raise questions about the integrity of the public cloud when privacy is a top priority “whos going to do cloud highly sensitive
