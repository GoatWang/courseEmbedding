fuel system that can be installed on any diesel engine and displaces up to  percent of the “end of day” diesel fuel consumption with either lng  cng or propane fuel is the only dual fuel technology that retains the preconversion oem specification for power and torque fuel system was the first to receive a carb certification first to receive an “oem” certification from epa and is the only dual fuel system that was commercialized in tier  oem production and the only company to offer propane in mobile applications this technology is available for both mobile and stationary applications fuel system benefits the fuel system employs all the advantages of natural gas or propane while maintaining the efficient design and reliable power of the diesel engine fuel is the only dual fuel technology that continues to blend fuels throughout the complete high load torque cycle and maintains the oem torque and hp the original mpg and reduces reliance on foreign energy fuel savings the fuel system displaces up to  of the “end of day diesel fuel consumption” with domestically produced clean natural gas or propane by using these alternative fuels to replace a large portion of the diesel fuel currently being consumed in your engines a tremendous reduction in fuel costs will be realized lower emissions smog acid rain and carcinogenic particulates are serious environmental issues today commercial vehicles contribute significant amounts of pollution to the environment by burning diesel fuel natural gas and propane powered vehicles have been proven to lower these emissions by up to  powering vehicles and stationary engines with natural gas or propane is an easy step towards lowering emissions and cleaning up the environment for our families energy independence cartel production control middle east conflict and emerging country demand are problems that increase oil instability in recent history oil prices fluctuate violently with no price stability what is needed is a lower cost fuel that is produced domestically the fuel system displaces diesel fuel used in an engine with clean domestically produced natural gas and propane how much can you save with fuel fuel delivers  more “end of day diesel fuel displacement” than any other dual fuel system fuel is the only dual fuel system that continues to blend fuels throughout the complete high load cycle and maintains the original diesel engine specified oem torque and hp mobile onroad a typical tractor trailer averages  miles per a gallon and  miles or more a year that’s more than  gallons of diesel fuel a year fuel savings calculator mobile offroad excavating and hauling equipment running  hours per day would consume a minimum of  gallons of diesel fuel per year fuel savings calculator stationary

ontario legislature he began to notice a trend an increase in plastic waste resulting from growing plastic generation  without recycling thinking forward as he so often does he saw the seed of an enormous problem looming in the ensuing  years the problem he foresaw has manifested because of the new disposable mentality that came with plastic containers we now are navigating the fallout of an enormous waste plastic problem on a global scale its complex its farreaching and its intimately tied to politics and economicsthe nugget of the problem that he had been thinking about all these years was what to do with the plastic waste we now generate – in the us alone over  million tons a year are generated with only approximately  being recycled over the years there have been various solutions proposed – diversion burning etc however nothing to date has proven to be a truly effective or environmentally responsible solution to the burgeoning global landfill problem in fact many existing solutions have been just the opposite costly energy inefficient or equally as harmful to the environment as the plastic itself its only now with the plasticoil technology that there is a solution that is not only economically viable but that is remarkably simple and green as well website last updated may   recent news releases subscribe to our rss feed plasticoil ceo provides update to shareholders
