investor must satisfactorily complete execute and deliver the subscription agreement and investor questionnaire to the portfolios placement agent items    and  of part a are omitted pursuant to item bbof the general instructions to form na investment objective principal investment strategies and related risks investment objective the investment objective of the portfolio is to seek high current income while there is no assurance that the portfolio will achieve its investment objective it endeavors to do so by following the strategies and policies described in this offering memorandum investment strategy the portfolio provides exposure to the highyield lowerrated corporate bond market at least  percent of the portfolios assets are invested in corporate bonds rated bbb or lower the adviser actively manages the portfolio seeking to realize the potentially higher returns of highyield bonds also known as junk bonds compared to returns of highgrade securities by seeking to minimize default risk and other risks through careful security selection and diversification the adviser selects securities seeking high yields low relative credit risk and high portfolio diversification if the issuer of a bond is unable to make all coupon and principal payments as promised realized yields will be less than promised the securities in which the portfolio invests have high yields primarily because of the markets greater uncertainty about the issuers ability to make all required interest and principal payments and therefore about the returns that will be in fact be realized by the portfolio the adviser attempts to select bonds for investment by the portfolio which offer superior potential returns for the default risks being assumed the advisers securities selection process consists of a creditintensive fundamental analysis of the issuing firm the advisers analysis focuses on the financial condition of the issuing firm together with the issuers business and product strength competitive position and management expertise further the adviser considers current economic financial market and industry factors which may affect the issuer the adviser attempts to minimize the portfolios credit risk through diversification the adviser selects securities to maintain broad portfolio diversification both by company and industry because the portfolio refers to highyield bond investments in its name it will notify shareholders in advance of any change in its investment policies that would enable the portfolio to normally invest less than  of its assets in fixedincome investments rated below investment grade securities and techniques fixed income securities the portfolio invests primarily in lowerrated corporate fixed income securities corporate fixed income securities are debt securities issued by us or foreign businesses notes bonds debentures and commercial paper are the most prevalent types of corporate debt securities the portfolio may also purchase interests in bank loans to companies the portfolio treats preferred stock which is redeemable by the issuer as a fixed income security preferred stocks have the right to receive specified dividends or distributions before the issuer makes payments on its common stock some preferred stock also participates in dividends and distributions paid on common stock the portfolio may invest in fixed income securities of issuers based outside the us the securities of foreign issuers in which the portfolio invests are primarily traded in the us and are predominantly denominated in us dollars fixed income securities pay interest dividends or distributions at a specified rate the rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically in addition the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the principal amount of the security normally within a specified time a securitys yield to maturity will increase or decrease depending upon whether it costs less a discount or more a premium than the principal amount the credit risks of corporate debt securities vary widely among issuers in addition the credit risk of an issuers debt securities may vary based on their priority for repayment for example higherranking senior securities have a higher priority than lower ranking subordinated securities this means that the issuer might not make payments on subordinated securities while continuing to make payments on senior securities typically both senior and subordinated debt securities have a higher priority than redeemable preferred stock most of the fixed income securities in which the portfolio invests will be uncollateralized and subordinated to other debt that a corporation has outstanding lower rated fixed income securities are securities rated below investment grade ie bb or lower by a nationally recognized rating service there is no minimal acceptable rating for a security to be purchased or held by the portfolio and the portfolio may purchase or hold unrated securities and securities whose issuers are in default temporary defensive investments the portfolio may temporarily depart from its principal investment strategies by investing its assets in cash cash items and shorterterm higher quality debt securities and similar obligations it may do this to minimize potential losses and maintain liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions during adverse market conditions this may cause the portfolio to give up greater investment returns to maintain the safety of principal that is the original amount invested by shareholders investment risks credit risks credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security by failing to pay interest or principal when due if an issuer defaults the portfolio will lose money the high yield bonds in which the portfolio invests have a higher default risk than investment grade securities lowgrade bonds are almost always uncollateralized and subordinated to other debt that a firm has outstanding many fixed income securities receive credit ratings from services such as standard  poors and moodys investor services inc these services assign ratings to securities by assessing the likelihood of issuer default lower credit ratings correspond to higher credit risk if a security has not received a rating the portfolio must rely entirely upon the advisers credit assessment fixed income securities generally compensate for greater credit risk by paying interest at a higher rate the difference between the yield of a security and the yield of a us treasury security with a comparable maturity the spread measures the additional interest paid for risk spreads may increase generally in response to adverse economic or market conditions a securitys spread may also increase if the securitys rating is lowered or the security is perceived to have an increased credit risk an increase in the spread will cause the price of the security to decline relative to higher quality instruments liquidity risks trading opportunities are more limited for fixed income securities that have not received any credit ratings have received ratings below investment grade or are not widely held these features may make it more difficult to sell or buy a security at a favorable price or time consequently the portfolio may have to accept a lower price to sell a security sell other securities to raise cash or give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on the portfolios performance infrequent trading of securities may also lead to an increase in their price volatility bond market risks prices of fixed income securities rise and fall in response to interest rate changes for similar securities generally when interest rates rise prices of fixed income securities fall interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixed income securities with longer durations duration measures the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates risks related to the economy like equity securities the prices of highyield securities are affected by the economy which is keyed to current and anticipated developments in

objective principal investment strategies and related risks investment objective the investment objective of the portfolio is to provide total return while there is no assurance that the portfolio will achieve its investment objective it endeavors to do so by following the strategies and policies described in this offering memorandum investment strategy the portfolio pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in mortgage backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos the adviser manages the portfolio by targeting a dollar weighted average duration relative to that of the lehman brothers mortgage backed securities index duration measures the price sensitivity of a portfolio of fixed income securities to changes in interest rates the adviser targets this range based upon its interest rate outlook the adviser formulates its interest rate outlook by analyzing a variety of factors such as o current and expected us economic growth o current and expected interest rates and inflation o the federal reserve boards monetary policy and o changes in the supply of or demand for us government securities the adviser generally shortens the portfolios average duration when it expects interest rates to rise and extends the duration when it expects interest rates to fall the adviser selects securities used to lengthen or shorten the portfolios average duration by comparing the returns currently offered by different investments to their historical and expected returns in selecting mortgage backed securities including cmos the analysis also focuses on the expected cash flows from the pool of mortgage obligations supporting the security the adviser attempts to assess the relative returns and risks of these securities by analyzing how the timing amount and division of cash flows from the pool might change in response to changing economic and market conditions the adviser may use cmos with more predictable cash flows such as sequential pay planned amortization class and targeted amortization class to improve the portfolios performance in volatile markets the adviser may also use combinations of cmos or cmos and passthrough certificates to provide a higher yielding investment with market risks similar to a passthrough certificate or a treasury security the combination may involve different mortgage pools unanticipated differences in prepayment rates of the pools may reduce the return of the combined investment combinations may also include cmos such as ios pos and inverse floaters that have complex terms or less predictable cash flows in addition to buying mortgage backed securities outright the portfolio may acquire securities on a to be announced basis in order to enhance yield the portfolio engages in dollar roll transactions to increase income the portfolio uses repurchase agreements to secure its obligations in these transactions because the portfolio refers to mortgage investments in its name it will notify shareholders in advance of any change in its investment policies that would enable the portfolio to normally invest less than  of its assets in mortgage investments securities and techniques fixed income securities fixed income securities pay interest dividends or distributions at a specified rate the rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically in addition the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the principal amount of the security normally within a specified time fixed income securities provide more regular income than equity securities however the returns on fixed income securities are limited and normally do not increase with the issuers earnings this limits the potential appreciation of fixed income securities as compared to equity securities a securitys yield measures the annual income earned on a security as a percentage of its price a securitys yield will increase or decrease depending upon whether it costs less a discount or more a premium than the principal amount if the issuer may redeem the security before its scheduled maturity the price and yield on a discount or premium security may change based upon the probability of an early redemption securities with higher risks generally have higher yields the following describes the types of fixed income securities in which the portfolio principally invests agency securities agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a federal agency or other government sponsored entity acting under federal authority a gse the united states supports some gses with its full faith and credit other gses receive support through federal subsidies loans or other benefits a few gses have no explicit financial support but are regarded as having implied support because the federal government sponsors their activities agency securities are generally regarded as having low credit risks but not as low as treasury securities the portfolio treats mortgage backed securities guaranteed by gses as agency securities although a gse guarantee protects against credit risks it does not reduce the interest rate and prepayment risks of these mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities represent interests in pools of mortgages the mortgages that comprise a pool normally have similar interest rates maturities and other terms mortgages may have fixed or adjustable interest rates interests in pools of adjustable rate mortgages are known as arms mortgage backed securities come in a variety of forms many have extremely complicated terms the simplest form of mortgage backed securities are passthrough certificates an issuer of passthrough certificates gathers monthly payments from an underlying pool of mortgages then the issuer deducts its fees and expenses and passes the balance of the payments onto the certificate holders once a month holders of passthrough certificates receive a pro rata share of all payments and prepayments from the underlying mortgages as a result the holders assume all the prepayment risks of the underlying mortgages the portfolio may invest in both agency mortgage backed securities and in mortgage backed securities that are issued by a private entity securities issued by private entities must be rated investment grade by one or more nationally recognized rating services the ability to invest in securities issued by a private entity creates credit risk collateralized mortgage obligations cmos including interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics allocate payments and prepayments from an underlying passthrough certificate among holders of different classes of mortgage backed securities this creates different prepayment and interest rate for each cmo class the degree of increased or decreased prepayment risks depends upon the structure of the cmos however the actual returns on any type of mortgage backed security depend upon the performance of the underlying pool of mortgages which no one can predict and will not vary among pools sequential cmos in a sequential pay cmo one class of cmos receives all principal payments and prepayments the next class of cmos receives all principal payments after the first class is paid off this process repeats for each sequential class of cmo as a result each class of sequential pay cmos reduces the prepayment risks of subsequent classes pacs tacs and companion classes more sophisticated cmos include planned amortization classes pacs and targeted amortization classes tacs pacs and tacs are issued with companion classes pacs and tacs receive principal payments and prepayments at a specified rate the companion classes receive principal payments and prepayments in excess of the specified rate in addition pacs will receive the companion classes share of principal payments if necessary to cover a shortfall in the prepayment rate this helps pacs and tacs to control prepayment risks by increasing the risks to their companion classes ios and pos cmos may allocate interest payments to one class interest only or ios and principal payments to another class principal only or pos pos increase in value when prepayment rates increase in contrast ios decrease in value when prepayments increase because the underlying mortgages generate less interest payments however ios tend to increase in value when interest rates rise and prepayments decrease making ios a useful hedge against market risks floaters and inverse floaters another variant allocates interest payments between two classes of cmos one class floaters receives a share of interest payments based upon a market index such as libor the other class inverse floaters receives any remaining interest payments from the underlying mortgages floater classes receive more interest and inverse floater classes receive correspondingly less interest as interest rates rise this shifts prepayment and interest rate risks from the floater to the inverse floater class reducing the price volatility of the floater class and increasing the price volatility of the inverse floater class z classes cmos must allocate all payments received from the underlying mortgages to some class to capture any unallocated payments cmos generally have an accrual z class z classes do not receive any payments from the underlying mortgages until all other cmo classes have been paid off once this happens holders of z class cmos receive all payments and prepayments similarly remics have residual interests that receive any mortgage payments not allocated to another remic class special transactions repurchase agreements repurchase agreements are transactions in which the portfolio buys a security from a dealer or bank and agrees to sell the security back at a mutually agreed upon time and price the repurchase price exceeds the sale price reflecting the portfolios return on the transaction this return is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying security the portfolio will enter into repurchase agreements only with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as securities dealers deemed creditworthy by the adviser the portfolios custodian or subcustodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements the adviser or subcustodian will monitor the value of the underlying security each day to ensure that the value of the security always equals or exceeds the repurchase price repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks delayed delivery transactions delayed delivery transactions including when issued transactions are arrangements in which the portfolio buys securities for a set price with payment and delivery of the securities scheduled for a future time during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the portfolio to the issuer and no interest accrues to the portfolio the portfolio records the transaction when it agrees to buy the securities and reflects their value in determining the price of its shares settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions so that the market values of the securities bought may vary from the purchase prices therefore delayed delivery transactions create market risks for the portfolio delayed delivery transactions also involve credit risks in the event of a counterparty default to be announced securities tbas as with other delayed delivery transactions a seller agrees to issue a tba security at a future date however the seller does not specify the particular securities to be delivered instead the portfolio agrees to accept any security that meets specified terms for example in a tba mortgage backed transaction the portfolio and the seller would agree upon the issuer interest rate and terms of the underlying mortgages the seller would not identify the specific underlying mortgages until it issues the security tba mortgage backed securities increase interest rate risks because the underlying mortgages may be less favorable than anticipated by the portfolio dollar rolls dollar rolls are transactions where the portfolio sells mortgagebacked securities with a commitment to buy similar but not identical mortgagebacked securities on a future date at a lower price normally one or both securities involved are tba mortgage backed securities dollar rolls are subject to market risks and credit risks securities lending the portfolio may lend portfolio securities to borrowers that the adviser deems creditworthy in return the portfolio receives cash or liquid securities from the borrower as collateral the borrower must furnish additional collateral if the market value of the loaned securities increases also the borrower must pay the portfolio the equivalent of any dividends or interest received on the loaned securities the portfolio will reinvest cash collateral in securities that qualify as an acceptable investment for the portfolio however the portfolio must pay interest to the borrower for the use of cash collateral loans are subject to termination at the option of the portfolio or the borrower the portfolio will not have the right to vote on securities while they are on loan but it will terminate a loan in anticipation of any important vote the portfolio may pay administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan and may pay a negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash collateral to a securities lending agent or broker securities lending activities are subject to interest rate risks and credit risks asset coverage in order to secure its obligations in connection with derivatives contracts or special transactions the portfolio will either own the underlying assets enter into an offsetting transaction or set aside readily marketable securities with a value that equals or exceeds the portfolios obligations unless the portfolio has other readily marketable assets to set aside it cannot trade assets used to secure such obligations entering into an offsetting derivative contract or terminating a special transaction this may cause the portfolio to miss favorable trading opportunities or to realize losses on derivative contracts or special transactions portfolio turnover prepayment of mortgage backed securities owned by the portfolio could result in a high portfolio turnover rate which is likely to generate shorterterm gains losses for its shareholders shortterm gains are taxed at a higher rate than longerterm gains high portfolio turnover increases the portfolios trading costs and may have an adverse impact on the portfolios performance temporary defensive investments the portfolio may temporarily depart from its principal investment strategies by investing its assets in cash cash items and shorterterm higher quality debt securities and similar obligations it may do this to minimize potential losses and maintain liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions during adverse market conditions this may cause the portfolio to give up greater investment returns to maintain the safety of principal that is the original amount invested by shareholders investment risks interest rate risks o prices of fixed income securities rise and fall in response to interest rate changes for similar securities generally when interest rates rise prices of fixed income securities fall o interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixed income securities with longer durations duration measures the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates credit risks o credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security by failing to pay interest or principal when due if an issuer defaults the portfolio will lose money prepayment risks o generally homeowners have the option to prepay their mortgages at any time without penalty homeowners frequently refinance high interest rate mortgages when mortgage rates fall this results in the prepayment of mortgage backed securities with higher interest rates conversely prepayments due to refinancings decrease when mortgage rates increase this extends the life of mortgage backed securities with lower interest rates as a result increases in prepayments of high interest rate mortgage backed securities or decreases in prepayments of lower interest rate mortgage backed securities may reduce their yield and price this relationship between interest rates and mortgage prepayments makes the price of mortgage backed securities more volatile than most other types of fixed income securities with comparable credit risks o mortgage backed securities generally compensate for greater prepayment risk by paying a higher yield the difference between the yield of a mortgage backed security and the yield of a us treasury security with a comparable maturity the spread measures the additional interest paid for risk spreads may increase generally in response to adverse economic or market conditions a securitys spread may also increase if the security is perceived to have increased prepayment risk or less market demand an increase in the spread may cause the price of the security to decline o if a fixed income security is called the portfolio may have to reinvest the proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower interest rates higher credit risks or other less favorable characteristics liquidity risks o trading opportunities are more limited for cmos that have complicated terms or that are not widely held these features may make it more difficult to sell or buy a security at a favorable price or time consequently the portfolio may have to accept a lower price to sell a security sell other securities to raise cash or give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on the portfolios performance infrequent trading of securities may also lead to an increase in their price volatility o liquidity risk also refers to the possibility that the portfolio may not be able to sell a security when it wants to if this happens the portfolio will be required to continue to hold the security and the portfolio could incur losses risks associated with complicated cmos o cmos with complicated terms such as companion classes ios pos and inverse floaters generally entail greater market prepayment and liquidity risks than other mortgage backed securities for example their prices are more volatile and their trading market may be more limited investment ratings for investment grade securities the adviser will determinate whether a security is investment grade based upon the credit ratings given by one or more nationally recognized rating services for example standard and poors a rating service assigns ratings to investment grade securities aaa aa a and bbb based on their assessment of the likelihood of the issuers inability to pay interest or principal default when due on each security lower credit ratings correspond to higher credit risk if a security has not received a rating the portfolio must rely entirely upon the advisers credit assessment that the security is comparable to investment grade management

accredited investors to participate conveniently and economically in the highyield bond sector of the fixedincome securities market investment objectives and policies investment objective the investment objective of the portfolio is to seek high current income the investment objective cannot be changed without approval of shareholders while there is no assurance that the portfolio will achieve its investment objective it endeavors to do so by following the investment policies described in this prospectus ppos amind�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd investment policies unless stated otherwise the trustees can change the investment policies without the approval of shareholders shareholders will be notified before any material change becomes effective the portfolio endeavors to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a professionally managed diversified portfolio of fixed income securities the fixed income securities in which the portfolio intends to invest are lowerrated corporate debt obligations which are commonly referred to as junk bonds some of these fixed income securities may involve equity features capital growth will be considered but only when consistent with the investment objective of high current income acceptable investments the portfolio invests at least  of its assets in lowerrated fixed income securities under normal circumstances the portfolio will not invest more than  of the value of its total assets in common equity securities and their equivalents the fixed income securities in which the portfolio invests include but are not limited to o preferred stocks o bonds o debentures o notes o equipment lease certificates and o equipment trust certificates the securities in which the portfolio may invest are generally rated bbb or lower by standard  poors ratings group sp or fitch investors service fitch or baa or lower by moodys investors service inc moodys or are not rated but are determined by the portfolios investment adviser to be of comparable quality and may include bonds in default securities which are rated bbb or lower by sp or fitch or baa or lower by moodys have speculative characteristics changes in economic conditions or other circumstances are more likely to lead to weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments than highly rated bonds a description of the rating categories is contained in the appendix to this prospectus there is no lower limit with respect to rating categories for securities in which the portfolio may invest see investment risks below foreign securities the portfolio may invest in foreign securities including foreign securities not publicly traded in the united states which may include any of the types of securities described above see acceptable investments investments in foreign securities particularly those of nongovernmental issuers involve considerations which are not ordinarily associated with investments in domestic issuers these considerations include the possibility of expropriation the unavailability of financial information or the difficulty of interpreting financial information prepared under foreign accounting standards less liquidity and more volatility in foreign securities markets the impact of political social or diplomatic developments and the difficulty of assessing economic trends in foreign countries it may also be more difficult to enforce contractual obligations abroad than would be the case in the united states because of differences in the legal systems transaction costs in foreign securities may be higher the adviser will consider these and other factors before investing in foreign securities and will not make such investments unless in its opinion such investments will meet the portfolios standards and objectives convertible securities the portfolio may invest in convertible securities convertible securities include a spectrum of securities which can be exchanged for or converted into common stock convertible securities may include but are not limited to convertible bonds or debentures convertible preferred stock units consisting of usable bonds and warrants or securities which cap or otherwise limit returns to the convertible security holder such as decs dividend enhanced convertible stock or debt exchangeable for common stock when issued as a debt security lyons liquid yield option notes which are corporate bonds that are purchased at prices below par with no coupons and are convertible into stock percs preferred equity redemption cumulative stock an equity issue that pays a high cash dividend has a cap price and mandatory conversion to common stock at maturity and prides preferred redeemable increased dividend securities which are essentially the same as decs the difference is little more than who initially underwrites the issue convertible securities are often rated below investment grade or not rated because they fall below debt obligations and just above common equity in order of preference or priority on the issuers balance sheet convertible securities rated below investment grade may be subject to some of the same risks as lowerrated bonds temporary investments the portfolio may invest temporarily in cash and shortterm obligations for defensive purposes during times of unusual market conditions shortterm obligations may include o certificates of deposit o commercial paper rated a or a by sp prime or prime by moodys or f or f by fitch and variable rate demand master notes o shortterm notes o obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the us government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities and o repurchase agreements repurchase agreements the portfolio will engage in repurchase agreements repurchase agreements are arrangements in which banks brokerdealers and other recognized financial institutions sell us government securities or other securities to the portfolio and agree at the time of sale to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon time and price the portfolio or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements and these securities will be marked to market daily to the extent that the original seller does not repurchase the securities from the portfolio the portfolio could receive less than the repurchase price on any sale of such securities in the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became insolvent disposition of such securities by the portfolio might be delayed pending court action the portfolio believes that under the regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the portfolios portfolio securities subject to repurchase agreements a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the portfolio and allow retention or disposition of such securities the portfolio will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as brokerdealers which are found by the portfolios adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to guidelines established by the trustees restricted and illiquid securities the portfolio may invest in restricted securities restricted securities are any securities in which the portfolio may otherwise invest pursuant to its investment objective and policies but which are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities law under criteria established by the trustees certain restricted securities are determined to be liquid to the extent that restricted securities are not determined to be liquid the portfolio will limit their purchase together with other illiquid securities including nonnegotiable time deposits and repurchase agreements providing for settlement in more than seven days after notice to  of its net assets lending of portfolio securities in order to generate additional income the portfolio may lend portfolio securities on a shortterm or longterm basis or both up to onethird of the value of its total assets to brokerdealers banks or other institutional borrowers of securities this is a fundamental policy which may not be changed without shareholder approval the portfolio will only enter into loan arrangements with brokerdealers banks or other institutions which the investment adviser has determined are creditworthy under guidelines established by the trustees and will receive collateral in the form of cash or us government securities equal to at least  of the value of the securities loaned at all times whenissued and delayed delivery transactions the portfolio may purchase securities on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis these transactions are arrangements in which the portfolio purchases securities with payment and delivery scheduled for a future time the sellers failure to complete these transactions may cause the portfolio to miss a price or yield considered to be advantageous settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices the portfolio may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the adviser deems it appropriate to do so in addition the portfolio may enter into transactions to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current market values and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar securities at later dates the portfolio may realize shortterm profits or losses upon the sale of such commitments investment risks the prices of fixed income securities fluctuate inversely to the direction of interest rates the corporate debt obligations in which the portfolio invests are usually not in the three highest rating categories of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations aaa aa or a for sp or fitch and aaa aa or a for moodys but are in the lower rating categories or are unrated but are of comparable quality and are regarded as having predominately speculative characteristics lowerrated or unrated bonds are commonly referred to as junk bonds there is no minimal acceptable rating for a security to be purchased or held in the portfolios portfolio and the portfolio may from to time purchase or hold securities rated in the lowest rating category and may include bonds in default a description of the rating categories is contained in the appendix lowerrated securities will usually offer higher yields than higherrated securities however there is more risk associated with these investments this is because of reduced creditworthiness and increased risk of default lowerrated securities generally tend to reflect shortterm corporate and market developments to a greater extent than higherrated securities which react primarily to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates shortterm corporate and market developments affecting the prices or liquidity of lowerrated securities could include adverse news affecting major issuers underwriters or dealers in lowerrated securities in addition since there are fewer investors in lowerrated securities it may be harder to sell the securities at an optimum time as a result of these factors lowerrated securities tend to have more price volatility and carry more risk to principal and income than higherrated securities an economic downturn may adversely affect the value of some lowerrated bonds such a downturn may especially affect highly leveraged companies or companies in cyclically sensitive industries where deterioration in a companys cash flow may impair its ability to meet its obligation to pay principal and interest to bondholders in a timely fashion from time to time as a result of changing conditions issuers of lowerrated bonds may seek or may be required to restructure the terms and conditions of the securities they have issued as a result of these restructurings holders of lowerrated securities may receive less principal and interest than they had bargained for at the time such bonds were purchased in the event of a restructuring the portfolio may bear additional legal or administrative expenses in order to maximize recovery from an issuer the portfolio may from time to time own zero coupon bonds or payinkind securities a zero coupon bond makes no periodic interest payments and the entire obligation becomes due only upon maturity payinkind securities make periodic payments in the form of additional securities as opposed to cash the price of zero coupon bonds and payinkind securities are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates than are conventional bonds additionally federal tax law requires that interest on zero coupon bonds and payinkind securities be reported as income to the portfolio even though the portfolio received no cash interest until the maturity or payment date of such securities many corporate debt obligations including many lowerrated bonds permit the issuers to call the security and thereby redeem their obligations earlier than the stated maturity dates issuers are more likely to call bonds during periods of declining interest rates in these cases if the portfolio owns a bond which is called the portfolio will receive its return of principal earlier than expected and would likely be required to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates thus reducing income to the portfolio reducing risks of lowerrated securities the portfolios investment adviser believes that the risks of investing in lowerrated securities can be reduced the professional portfolio management techniques used by the portfolio to attempt to reduce these risks include credit research the portfolios investment adviser will perform its own credit analysis in addition to using recognized rating agencies and other sources including discussions with the issuers management the judgment of other investment analysts and its own informed judgment the advisers credit analysis will consider the issuers financial soundness its responsiveness to changes in interest rates and business conditions and its anticipated cash flow interest or dividend coverage and earnings in evaluating an issuer the adviser places special emphasis on the estimated current value of the issuers assets rather than historical cost diversification the portfolio invests in securities of many different issuers industries and economic sectors to reduce portfolio risk economic analysis the portfolios adviser will analyze current developments and trends in the economy and in the financial markets when investing in lowerrated securities timing and selection are critical and analysis of the business cycle can be important investment limitations the portfolio will not borrow money directly or through reverse repurchase agreements arrangements in which the portfolio sells a portfolio instrument for a percentage of its cash value with an agreement to buy it back on a set date or pledge securities except under certain circumstances the portfolio may borrow money and engage in reverse repurchase agreements in amounts up to onethird of the value of its total assets and pledge up to  of the value of those assets to secure such borrowings the above investment limitations cannot be changed without shareholder approval the following limitation however can be changed by the trustees without shareholder approval shareholders will be notified before any material change in this limitation becomes effective the portfolio will not invest more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities

high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as highgrade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa

unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well babonds which are ba are judged to have speculative

political conditions although the portfolio values its assets daily in us dollars the portfolio may not convert its holdings of foreign currencies to us dollars daily when the portfolio converts its holdings to another currency it may incur conversion costs foreign exchange dealers may realize a profit on the difference between the price at which they buy and sell currencies the portfolio may engage in foreign currency exchange transactions in connection with its investments in foreign securities the portfolio will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies investing in foreign currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts the portfolio may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts in order to protect itself against a possible loss resulting from an adverse change in the relationship between the us dollar and a foreign currency involved in an underlying transaction however forward foreign currency exchange contracts may limit potential gains which could result from a positive change in such currency relationships the portfolios investment adviser believes that it is important to have the flexibility to enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts whenever it determines that it is in the portfolios best interest to do so the portfolio will not speculate in foreign currency exchange there is no limitation as to the percentage of the portfolios assets that may be committed to such contracts the portfolio does not enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts or maintain a net exposure in such contracts when the portfolio would be obligated to deliver an amount of foreign currency in excess of the value of the portfolios portfolio securities or other assets denominated in that currency or in the case of a crosshedge denominated in a currency or currencies that the portfolios adviser believes will tend to be closely correlated with the currency with regard to price movements generally the portfolio does not enter into a forward foreign currency exchange contract with a term longer than one year foreign currency options a foreign currency option provides the option buyer with the right to buy or sell a stated amount of foreign currency at the exercise price on a specified date or during the option period the owner of a call option has the right but not the obligation to buy the currency conversely the owner of a put option has the right but not the obligation to sell the currency when the option is exercised the seller ie writer of the option is obligated to fulfill the terms of the sold option however either the seller or the buyer may in the secondary market close its position during the option period at any time prior to expiration a call option on foreign currency generally rises in value if the underlying currency appreciates in value and a put option on foreign currency generally falls in value if the underlying currency depreciates in value although purchasing a foreign currency option can protect the portfolio against an adverse movement in the value of a foreign currency the option will not limit the movement in the value of such currency for example if the portfolio were holding securities denominated in a foreign currency that was appreciating and had purchased a foreign currency put to hedge against a decline in the value of the currency the portfolio would not have to exercise its put option likewise if the portfolio were to enter into a contract to purchase a security denominated in foreign currency and in conjunction with that purchase were to purchase a foreign currency call option to hedge against a rise in value of the currency and if the value of the currency instead depreciated between the date of purchase and the settlement date the portfolio would not have to exercise its call instead the portfolio could acquire in the spot market the amount of foreign currency needed for settlement special risks associated with foreign currency options buyers and sellers of foreign currency options are subject to the same risks that apply to options generally in addition there are certain additional risks associated with foreign currency options the markets in foreign currency options are relatively new and the portfolios ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the maintenance of a liquid secondary market although the portfolio will not purchase or write such options unless and until in the opinion of the portfolios adviser the market for them has developed sufficiently to ensure that the risks in connection with such options are not greater than the risks in connection with the underlying currency there can be no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for a particular option at any specific time in addition options on foreign currencies are affected by all of those factors that influence foreign exchange rates and investments generally the value of a foreign currency option depends upon the value of the underlying currency relative to the us dollar as a result the price of the option position may vary with changes in the value of either or both currencies and may have no relationship to the investment merits of a foreign security because foreign currency transactions occurring in the interbank market involve substantially larger amounts than those that may be involved in the use of foreign currency options investors may be disadvantaged by having to deal in an odd lot market generally consisting of transactions of less than  million for the underlying foreign currencies at prices that are less favorable than for round lots there is no systematic reporting of last sale information for foreign currencies or any regulatory requirement that quotations available through dealers or other market sources be firm or revised on a timely basis available quotation information is generally representative of very large transactions in the interbank market and thus may not reflect relatively smaller transactions ie less than  million where rates may be less favorable the interbank market in foreign currencies is a global aroundtheclock market to the extent that the us option markets are closed while the markets for the underlying currencies remain open significant price and rate movements may take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options markets until they reopen repurchase agreements the portfolio or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements and these securities will be marked to

which are deemed by the portfolios adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to guidelines established by the trustees reverse repurchase agreements the portfolio may enter into reverse repurchase agreements these transactions are similar to borrowing cash in a reverse repurchase agreement the portfolio transfers possession of a portfolio instrument to another person such as a financial institution broker or dealer in return for a percentage of the instruments market value in cash and agrees that on a stipulated date in the future the portfolio will repurchase the portfolio instrument by remitting the original consideration plus interest at an agreed upon rate when effecting reverse repurchase agreements liquid assets of the portfolio in a dollar amount sufficient to
