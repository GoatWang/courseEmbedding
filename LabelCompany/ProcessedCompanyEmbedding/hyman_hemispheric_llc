plans    back to gallery saratoga springs a voorheesville developer with an  million plan for the high rock parcel behind saratoga springs city hall has won the endorsement of a citizens group citizens for high rock on thursday announced its support for a joint proposal from hyman hemispheric llc and sequence development to build  parking spaces housing and retail shops on the acre downtown site prepared by jeff hyman the  million proposal is one of three competing visions for the cityowned property now a parking lot containing  spots and the only that proposes buying the land the other two plans involve leasing the hyman proposal has the greatest potential said julie cuneo of saratoga springs chair of citizens for high rock hyman proposes a mixture of building shapes and sizes retail along all surrounding streets a mix of housing types and office space which can target larger companies that have a hard time finding suitable office space in the city cuneo said it offers effective pedestrian circulation and a system of outdoor open spaces where people can congregate hyman offered the city  million for the high rock land before a firm hired by the city appraised it at  million last month on thursday he thanked the citizens group for its endorsement the city continues toward selecting a preferred developer and concept for reimagining the high rock parking lot and our team continues to work diligently on refinements and improvements to our concept and project plan hyman said there are numerous important stakeholders that can have should have and are having meaningful valueadded input to choices related to the best path forward for this land mass so critical to the next chapter in downtown saratoga springs development hyman hemispheric and sequence development along with another partnership paramount realty of syracuse and the community builders of albany responded to a request for proposals issued by the city to develop the high rock property with mixed uses submitted by syracuse developer rich de vito paramounts  million highrock village plan calls for constructing  parking spaces senior and affordable housing and retail stores to the area the saratoga springs city center submitted the other plan for the parcel before mayor joanne yepsen led the effort to seek mixeduses for the site the city center has applied to build a  million parking facility with  spaces and a foot covered pedestrian bridge with parking on  acres of the high rock property the city center will release terms and conditions of its proposed lease with the city after discussing them with the city council city center president mark baker said the design review commission voted last week to approve the city centers parking facility the city center authority could ask the city council to approve a land lease for its garage in the next  days the biggest and nearly last hurdle left in the approval process baker said we feel we have answered many of the questions he said we anticipate a successful issuance of a land lease then a final architecture review at the design review commission dyuskotimesunioncom •  • dayusko news videos most popular

proposed highrock village on the spot where cityowned parking lots between maple avenue and high rock now exist housing is on both sides by rj deluke two groups–a syracusebased development company and a capital region partnership– have proposed multimillion dollar plans to build mixeduse projects on the cityowned parking lots along high rock maple and lake avenues in saratoga springs both have presented plans to the city council mayor joanne yepsen said she will try to set up a meeting this month–date to be determined by her planning staff–where representatives from both development groups will give a public presentation it will be open to the public she said she will also form an internal technical review team that will go over the proposals “we want to move swiftly” she said the mayor said the mixeduse aspect is preferable to the somewhat controversial first proposal that emerged involving saratoga city center she feels the council can make an informed choice this year and construction could start in  the city center had proposed a  million space parking structure on  acres of the site the city center would have leased the land from the city for  years but it is opposed by some in the community including a citizens group named citizens for high rock members of the group didn’t care for the city center’s project design it has said it prefers a dense mixeduse development the two new proposals contain plans for housing parking and retail shops and perhaps offices paramount realty group llc in syracuse plans a  million multiuse project called highrock village richard devito a partner with the group said his proposal consists of housing priced to appeal to some of the local workforce senior housing condos shops and a pedestrian promenade it will also provide parking spaces for residents and the general public the group has partnered with community builders which has an office in albany on the project located on  acres of land behind city hall the other proposal is from hyman hemispheric llc of voorheesville and sequence development llc of troy jeff hyman of hyman hemispheric llc said his plan is in the area of  million there is flexibility in the plans and there could be many “tweaks” while the process moves along through meetings with the city and other stakeholders he said but basically there would be about  marketrate apartments for rent and retail and office segments hyman said about  parking spaces would be included that would be divided among the city center the city itself residents and shoppers said devito “we’re talking about  parking spaces for the city center more than they requested then  or so spaces to the city about  for the residents and about  for the general public” de vito said the public spaces he said would be free for first hour and a small fee for extra time yet to be determined the company is seeking a year lease on the land and taxexempt bonds for the parking garage paramount’s funding devito said is already in place he said once built the city would get a base rent plus a  percent share of revenues he estimated that could be some  per year for the city coffers “the mix of shops and restaurants occupying the space will compliment the offerings in an already thriving downtown extending the vitality of the broadway corridor to maple and high rock avenues and helping to activate space creating a vibrant plazatype atmosphere” said the page report submitted by paramount to the city the courtyard at grade with maple avenue will be open to the public and “serve as a focal point of activity for residents and community members and will be a logical connection between points of interest in the surrounding neighborhood” from the mouzon house restaurant in the north end of the lot the view would not be of a mammoth parking garage but of the scenic promenade with shops and activity he said because of the slop of the land the view from maple avenue would appear like a threestory building and from high rock as a five stories the developer said “our project is a reflection of the needs of the community” he said the project is dubbed highrock village the developer said he was staying at the hampton inn suites across the street from the project site and became curious about the lot when the lot caught his attention he viewed it as a prime development spot he spoke with mayor yepsen and learned about the rfp process and what the city was looking for “we’ve done a pretty good job of turning around the downtown in syracuse by brining housing downtown” he said referring to the development which turned an old warehouse district into armory square with retail restaurants and apartments revitalizing that section of the city he said he also met with citizens for high rock a group that is advocating for a comprehensive multiuse design for the publicly owned land and explained what he had in mind he called it a “winwin for everyone” “one of the main needs in the community i’ve been hearing over and over is there is no workforce housing” he said the project includes  apartment units for seniors and  designated as for workforce there will also be condos and apartments available for rent or purchase at marketrate prices while there are pricing decisions still to be made devito said the condos”you can probably get for about  not  million” the project will be about  square feet and parts swill be six stories high there will be belowstreetlevel parking for some residents the report indicates it would also create jobs there would be in property management and maintenance for the apartments and also senior housing administration and maintenance the report estimated payment of about  million annual taxes for the city county and local school district and could generate about  a year in sales tax revenue the city does not have a time schedule for approving any project but devito said if the city acted quickly construction could start in the spring and phase i the parking garage and part of the senior housing could be done in about a year hyman said if the city selected his partnership construction would start next year there would be an effort made to keep some of the parking available while construction goes on so as not to make parking problems in the downtown area any worse “there’s a way to make it work for everybody” said hyman a former investment banker who has experience in gathering funding for multiuse projects over the years “hopefully all the stakeholders will come together and make it work” hyman said saratoga springs has a very strong real estate market and he expects that  units would be absorbed and meet a need in the city “we suspect there’s going to be lot of back and forth with city officials on some of the details of the design which we would welcome in order to get it right” “we’re tremendously excited it’s a unique opportunity” he said categories plus banking banking  asset managment

to not pursue a private casino license bid in binghamtonphoto andrew thayer  staff photobuy photo  connecttweet  linkedincommentemailmorethe albanyarea developer who announced and then canceled plans to bid for a casino license in the city of binghamton says the events earlier this month have left him down but not out“i’m not going away” jeffrey hyman told the press  sunbulletin’s editorial board during an hourlong meeting thursday “i’ve intended to for a couple of months now — and still have designs — on bringing some considerable new investment into this community”hyman revealed several details of the proposal that hyman hemispherics llc and its associates were planning to submit to the state gaming commission in support of its application for a fourth upstate casino license three licenses were given preliminary approval in december and earlier this year the gaming commission agreed to accept new southern tier applicationsthe day before the deadline hyman sent a letter to the gaming commission in which he said uncertainty surrounding a tax credit led his investors to pull their support that came less than a week after hyman successfully solicited support from the binghamton city council a required step for an application to be accepted the withdrawal left tioga downs in nichols as the sole applicanthyman’s proposal which would have carried the name southern tier star was focused around the former stow manufacturing site at montgomery and frederick streets on the city’s north side on thursday hyman emphasized that his group remains committed to redeveloping the brownfield sitekey locationgroundwork for the casino bid he said convinced him that the site holds potential that is just waiting for the right push toward what he and ryan moses managing director of park strategies and consultant to hyman hemispheric llc repeatedly called “a higher and better use”location is key to real estate and hyman’s team started out with a general area in mind they wanted a site in the city and after months of research into the potential gaming market the stow manufacturing site and its adjacent properties stood out where interstate  and route  come together is as he put it “the crossroads of civilization here for a long distance in any direction”no matter where the team turned hyman said they kept turning back there“as we talked to people about different possibilities in different sites they kept coming back to us and saying go there go there go there” he said repeatedly tapping a finger on a map of the north side locationhyman and moses are convinced that an ideal location for a gaming complex could translate into an ideal location for a different but related use they suggested a couple of general areas something in the ballpark of an entertainment or destination venue or possibly retail or lodginghyman said he has had suggestions for potential partnerships and refused to rule out anything“it would be nice to have something with jobs and a lot of tax revenue” he said “that’s kind of my mantra and it fulfills the purpose of the brownfield program”the state’s brownfield cleanup program and associated tax credits hyman and moses said were the lynchpin to both the casino plan and redevelopment potential at stowsite questionsthat program of the state department of environmental conservation is intended “to encourage privatesector cleanups of brownfields and to promote their redevelopment as a means to revitalize economically blighted communities” according to the dec tax credits are part of the program a base of  to  percent plus additional amounts depending on the site and proposed use designed as an incentive in the face of potentially costly surprises that can come with environmental cleanupin the case of the stow site hyman’s group had expected an additional  percent as part of a socalled “enzone” or census tract of high poverty and unemployment hyman and moses said latehour uncertainty over that classification worried investors and finally collapsed the proposalit was a matter of numbers they said the project had a capital investment of about  million about  million of which was equity and the rest leveraged debt the group expected enzone tax credits would protect in the neighborhood of  to  millionthree days before the casino application was due new preliminary maps of enzoneeligible tracts were published that appeared to exclude part of the stow parcel which crosses census tracts one side of frederick counts the other does notsuch news the friday before independence day brought a scramble“jeff had a responsibility as head of the project to go to our investors and say ‘we’re going to try to figure out why this changed from july first to july second’” moses said “ultimately we couldn’t retrieve that answer in a way that made our investors comfortable”a spokesman for the dec has disputed their interpretation of the enzone boundaries yet hyman and moses said they were not naive about the process and declined to assign any blame they maintained that their project site was eligible for up to  million in tax credits one day and appeared to be ineligible the next that makes for nervous investors“when you’re asking somebody to put  million in hard equity down and there could be a  percent hole in that — and that’s only going to come from one place more equity — it changes the dynamics” hyman saidfriday ran into saturday hyman recalled without the magic words that would reassure the investors a conversation late saturday with an attorney sealed the proposal’s fate“it didn’t take me long at that point in good faith and full disclosure i had to call the investors” hyman said “i guess this was well into the night of july  because we could hear the fireworks at the capitol mall — we were in downtown albany — exploding out there as our project was exploding”now whatwhat remains are both a sense that the north side parcel is ripe for revitalization and that the local climate is welcomingmayor richard david county executive debbie preston and the agency executive director kevin mclaughlin “welcomed us into this community in a way that made it easy to want to do business here” moses saidhyman’s group remains in talks with the dec seeking clarity on the parcel’s brownfield and enzone status he remains confident that credits will be secured — that everyone will realize that redevelopment of the site fits the dec’s goals under the program and that tax credits are necessary to protect the investment risk“i think the whole prospect of taking property into a higher and better use is by far the thing i’m proudest of when i look back on my career and the thing i’m most enthused about doing as i go forward” he saidfollow john r roby on
