for more than  billion one veteran media research analyst gave the deal only a  chance of being approved credit yana paskova for the new york times jeffrey l bewkes the chief executive of time warner made a big bet in the summer of  when he rejected an  billion takeover bid by st century fox controlled by rupert murdochmr bewkes had promised shareholders that time warner would create more value on its own than any proposal fox was positioned to offer privately mr bewkes was telling colleagues and investors that time warner was likely to land a much more lucrative deal if it were put on the market a couple of years later among the potential bidders time warner reasoned were deeppocketed technology companies like apple and google — and even possibly att which was tied up with a different deal at the timeover the next two years it was not clear that mr bewkes had played his cards right fears of cordcutting ratings declines and a weak advertising market stoked panic across the industry over the future of traditional media in a digital world and while time warner introduced several efforts to transform the company such as a standalone streaming service for hbo questions persisted about whether the company would have the resources to compete with the likes of netflix and amazonas it turns out mr bewkes’s bet paid off in a big wayon saturday night att announced that it had agreed to buy time warner for about  billion or  a share in cash and stock — about a  percent premium to where time warner’s stock was trading before reports of the merger talks and well above the  a share fox was offering advertisement continue reading the main story att and time warner promised to “lead the next wave of innovation” as the worlds of media communications and technology collide

magazine sports illustrated and fortune ’  bil october  time warner is reportedly in advanced talks to be sold to att ’  bil source reuters market value   as of oct  oct   by the new york times and for mr bewkes the deal has sealed his legacy as a behindthescenes nonmogul media mogulin an industry populated by largerthanlife executives like mr murdoch and sumner redstone whose activities have sometimes provided fodder for the gossip pages mr bewkes carved out a reputation as a personable numbers guy with a sense of humor and a low public profile mr bewkes lifted the company’s stock price slowly but surely by disposing of assets eventually making his company the most attractive takeover target in the media market“he is not an executive that is cut from the oldschool media mogul cloth” said anthony diclemente an analyst with nomura “his legacy is very much that he did so well for shareholders whereas another type of media executive a personality like a sumner redstone would want to continue to preside and reign over this powerful media empire”in an interview on sunday mr bewkes deferred a question on how he thought about the atttime warner deal in the context of his own legacy as a media executive“i don’t think of it as my legacy” mr bewkes said “i think of it as the great institution of time warner which has had a mission in this world since henry luce invented the magazine in  and actually invented talking pictures in the years since”mr bewkes  has worked at time warner for more than three decades he became the chief executive of the premium tv network hbo in  where he helped raise the network’s profile by pushing for more original programming his purview expanded in  when he was named chairman of the company’s networks and entertainment division and in  mr bewkes succeeded richard parsons in the chief executive’s suiteat the time the company was still reeling from its disastrous dotcom merger with aol time warner shares traded as low as  mr bewkes whittled the company down unloading time warner cable then aol then its time inc magazine division what remained was a focused and wellrespected television and film company that owned hbo warner bros film and television studios and cable networks including cnn tnt turner sports and tbs advertisement continue reading the main story “that gave us the best choice of whether we wanted to consolidate another company into ours or it made us the most valuable company if we wanted to consolidate with someone else which is what we have now come to” mr bewkes said photo jeffrey bewkes the chief executive of time warner with president obama and his family at a concert in  mr bewkes has carved out a reputation as a personable numbers guy with a sense of humor credit brendan smialowskiagence francepresse — getty images but mr bewkes was not ready to exercise those options in the summer of  when fox appeared with its takeover offer he said that he had never doubted the decision in large part because time warner management considered the deal to be worth much less than it initially seemedon the day that the fox deal was announced the transaction was worth about  billion but that deal was heavily tilted toward fox stock which has lost about a third of its value since then in addition the transaction required taking out a substantial loan to cover the cash portion and time warner would have assumed part of that debtas a result time warner estimates that the fox deal would be valued at about  per share today the att bid represents about a  percent premium over the fox offer“we knew all that” mr bewkes said “that is why we didn’t consider it”it was a different story in august when randall l stephenson att’s chief executive visited mr bewkes at time warner’s headquarters in new york the two executives discussed their views for the future of content and distribution amid the rise of streaming services that are blurring lines among the media communication and technology industries their visions aligned and a deal quickly fell into place“we see a convergence” mr bewkes said “it is not just creating content but introducing it to you as a viewer wherever you go”as an example mr bewkes pointed to more vigorous cnn offerings on mobile and better search and recommendation tools to discover hbo programming whether a person is watching on a mobile phone tablet or television setmr bewkes acknowledged that on its own the media industry has been slow to put in effect new technologies that allow people to watch the programming they want to watch — when and how

things like that if we are together” advertisement continue reading the main story on sunday att insisted that it would not try to influence its new assets in either the entertainment or news segments“our intent is to operate time warner as it operates today with autonomy in its divisions including the worldclass creative talent and journalists that make time warner a leader in entertainment and news” mr stephenson said in a statement“cnn is an american symbol of independent journalism and first amendment free speech” he added “my board and i are clear — cnn will remain completely independent from an editorial perspective”att’s deal for time warner is expected to face intense regulatory pressure and if it is approved the companies do not expect it to close until late  mr bewkes whose contract with time warner runs through  is planning to stay with the company through a yettobedetermined transition periodanalysts said that they expected many other time warner executives to continue in their roles because att is a telecom company with little experience in programming that was yet another contrast to the murdoch offer“any offer that was made to time warner was prefaced with the notion that the key upandcoming leadership within time warner would not be jettisoned” mr diclemente said “that tone in general is a little different than the murdoch tone which was perceived as the expectation that they would be working for rupert james and lachlan murdoch”“culturally this is more of a reason why this fits” he addedmr bewkes put it more bluntly “this fell into place” he said “because it is kind of obvious” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage swift opposition to

revenues increasing  to  billion reflecting growth at all our operating divisions we grew our adjusted operating income by  to a record  billion adjusted eps was up  and year to date weve returned  billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases these results reflect the steady progress were making on our strategic priorities and they put us on track for another year of very attractive financial performance as you all know were committed to delivering industryleading financial results while investing aggressively to adapt to the rapid changes in the media landscape we will continue to help fund those investments through a companywide focus on operational efficiency and those investments are what will allow us to capitalize on the growing global opportunities for the very best video content across both the traditional and emerging video ecosystems you can see how were taking advantage of those opportunities in the performance of each of our divisions this quarter let me start with home box office where our unrivaled original programming has never been stronger this year hbo and its sister channel cinemax received a combined  primetime emmy nominations that includes a record of  for hbo and that marks the th year in a row that hbo has received the most nominations of any network and it includes nominations for outstanding comedy series for silicon valley and veep and for outstanding drama series for game of thrones these accolades reflect the excitement were seeing among hbo subscribers game of thrones fifth season set yet another record as the most watched hbo season ever captivating over  million viewers each episode and three of our acclaimed newcomers from last year silicon valley last week tonight with john oliver and true detective each returned to strong audiences in their second seasons in june we introduced two new hits ballers and the brink both of which have already been renewed we launched hbo now our standalone streaming service in the us during the second quarter and were extremely pleased with how well its been received it was the top grossing entertainment app on itunes in both may and june and we recently extended its distribution to verizon amazon and google well be adding other platforms soon as well as more traditional distribution partners given the positive early reaction to now we are already investing in additional programming to support the service for example we think programming from our new multiplatform agreement with sports personality bill simmons will be particularly appealing to consumers in an ondemand environment at the same time our discussions with the creative community indicate hbo go and hbo now have made the service an even more attractive outlet and you will see additional announcements demonstrating that in the coming months in addition to programming well be investing even more in marketing to take advantage of the large subscriber opportunity we see in front of us we are also in the process of significantly increasing our programming investment at turners entertainment networks with a focus on more creatively ambitious projects and thats going to further differentiate and strengthen networks that are already leading the industry in the second quarter tnt and tbs ranked number one and number two respectively among adsupported cable networks in primetime with adults  to  and including adult swim turner claimed the top three spots in primetime among adults  to  adult swim also finished as adsupported cables number one network in total day among adults  to  for the th consecutive quarter supported by originals like rick and morty which just celebrated its second season debut by more than doubling its audience from last seasons premiere tnts leading performance in the quarter underscored the importance of our partnership with the nba and the strength of our onair talent so were particularly pleased that the crew of the emmy awardwinning inside the nba has reupped with turner for the duration of our new nba agreement over time were confident that refreshing our brands and our content at tbs and tnt will result in the same kind of renaissance were seeing at cartoon network and cnn cartoon network grew total day ratings among kids  to  by double digits and it was the only major kids network to grow in the quarter overtaking nickelodeon as the number two network in that demo for the first time in its history at cnn primetime viewership in its key to demo grew  in the quarter and it continued to age down while our competitors aged up cnn is also building on its lead in digital in june cnncom streamed  million videos thats a record for the site and it made it the news leader in digital video for the second straight month ahead of buzzfeed and yahoo news turner and warner bros are also making progress on their global kids strategy together they recently announced plans to produce close to  halfhours of

will provide a new platform for warners to reinvigorate classic characters and to create new kids franchises and its a great example of the natural collaboration taking place across the company were upgrading not just our content but also our marketing partners ability to utilize it effectively at this years upfront we announced the new turner data cloud which provides marketers a greatly enhanced ability to target audiences across our linear and digital properties and our innovative advertising products were critical to turner garnering price increases at the very top of the industry warner bros also had a strong performance in this years upfront with  programs slated for the upcoming television season warners lineup included  shows on broadcast primetime with at least two series on each network that includes a record  returning shows and it makes warners the top supplier of broadcast series again this year we all know warners is the gold standard in television and film production but its growing video game business is also an industry leader for the first half of the year warner ranked as the top video game publisher in north america and had the two biggest releases in batman arkham knight and mortal kombat x were looking to build on that momentum with next months release of lego dimensions our entry into the toystolife category what youve seen across warner which is also happening throughout our company is how the best ip can be monetized across many different platforms both inside and beyond traditional ecosystems for example dc content is the basis for seven shows scheduled to air in the upcoming season including returning hits like the flash and gotham and new shows such as supergirl its also the basis for our biggest games franchise and new ventures like dcs super hero girls the toys and digital content partnership we recently announced with mattel plus i cant resist pointing out we still have a nice business selling actual comic books and of course there are the films at last months comiccon the new trailer for batman v superman dawn of justice generated the most buzz of any upcoming film both inside the convention halls and on social media and dcs suicide squad was not far behind those films dont come out until  but they provide a sense as to why we have so much confidence in our slate for the next year and many years to come so a year after the time inc spinoff im really pleased with how were executing our strategy to take advantage of the growing opportunities we see both within and beyond the traditional video ecosystem at the same time we recognize the pace of change in our industry is accelerating and that means were going to have to move even faster to ensure we have the best content provide the best possible consumer experience and can monetize our viewership effectively across a wide variety of platforms and geographies all while maintaining our focus on operational efficiency so in the coming months and years youll see us investing aggressively to stay ahead of the changes in our industry and capitalize on an environment where the biggest hits networks and brands are taking share with our global scale and strong brands im confident were well positioned for that environment and that we can both meet our strategic objectives and continue to deliver industryleading financial results with that let me turn it over to howard howard m averill  executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff and good morning ill begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation which is now available on our website starting with consolidated results halfway through the year were really pleased with our execution to date in the first half we grew adjusted operating income  and adjusted eps  and we did that while making progress on our strategic objectives and investing aggressively for future growth in the second quarter revenue was up a very healthy  and adjusted operating income rose  to  billion a record quarterly profit and excluding a drag of approximately  basis points from fx revenue growth would have been  in addition to strong revenue growth adjusted operating income margins expanded more than  basis points and thats despite  growth in total expenses primarily from increased investments in content and marketing moving forward well remain disciplined on overhead and other nonprogrammingrelated spending to help fund investments that will strengthen our competitive position and drive future growth moving down the income statement adjusted eps grew  in the quarter so once again we were able to grow adjusted eps even faster than adjusted operating income that was helped by our ongoing share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter during the quarter we repurchased over  million in shares and paid close to  million in dividends so year to date weve returned over  billion to shareholders and this morning we reaffirmed our guidance for  adjusted eps to be in the range of  to  that implies midteens growth in adjusted eps when excluding the programming and restructuring charges and tax matters from the second half of  and thats despite a material drag from a stronger us dollar that we have discussed with you previously so we feel really good about how were operating and remain focused on executing our strategy to drive continued growth longer term now turning to the segment highlights ill begin at turner where we posted very strong profit growth of  subscription revenues increased  or  excluding the impact of fx domestic subscription revenue grew  consistent with the first quarter absent a drag of approximately  percentage points from fx international subscription revenue was up low double digits and on that basis we continue to see the healthiest trends in latin america looking to the third quarter we expect a negative impact of approximately  basis points on total subscription revenue growth as a result of fx and the benefit from certain contractual settlements in the third quarter of  however we expect underlying domestic subscriber trends to be consistent with the first half of the year and remain on track for domestic sub revenue growth to accelerate into the teens in  and  moving on advertising declined  but excluding fx grew a little more than  that was a bit below our initial expectations largely due to airing fewer nba playoff games than anticipated in total the impact from foreign exchange fewer nba games and the absence of nascar weighed on growth by close to  basis points in the quarter domestic advertising grew slightly in the quarter international advertising grew low single digits when excluding an fx drag of over  and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in brazil and that was despite difficult comparisons in latin america due to the impact of the world cup last year looking ahead to the third quarter scatter pricing is currently pacing up high single to low double digits the ratings at our entertainment networks will likely offset that benefit we also expect a drag of over  basis points on advertising from the combination of foreign exchange and the absence of nascar programming as a result we anticipate total advertising revenue to be down modestly content and other revenues increased close to  in the quarter and that was boosted by our deal with hulu which is a great example of how we can benefit from our increased investment in and ownership of original programming adjusted operating income was up  with margins expanding close to  basis points that was helped by a  decline in total expenses including lower programming costs programming expenses were down  in the quarter that was largely due to the absence of nascar programming as well as lower acquired programming costs as we discussed with you previously we are investing in new content that better fits our refreshed programming strategy at tnt and tbs the ramp in that programming will start to show up in the fourth quarter of this year taking that into account and the absence of nascar programming in the third quarter we anticipate that programming cost growth will be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter sga expenses were essentially flat in the quarter but excluding a reversal of an accrued contingency in the second quarter of last year sga would have been down midsingle digits and that reflects our continued focus on cost efficiencies and savings from last years restructuring actions so overall turner is executing really well and is making great progress on its strategic initiatives and we remain on track to deliver strong growth and adjusted operating income in  while continuing to make the investments necessary to position us for strong growth over the long term turning now to hbo where we are investing significantly to take advantage of the large global opportunity we see for premium services domestically subscription revenue growth remained in the midsingle digits despite very attractive sub growth consistent with recent quarters subscription revenue growth has been limited by a shift toward nonrevenue generating subs over time we expect to better monetize those subscribers which should help drive an acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth similarly we anticipate hbo now will be a more material contributor to subscription revenue growth over time were pleased with the initial consumer response to the service but we saw only a modest benefit to the sub revenue in the second quarter due to the day free trial period for new subscribers looking ahead to the third quarter we expect to benefit from a full quarter of paying subs on hbo now and as jeff mentioned hbo now recently launched on amazon google and verizon which should contribute more meaningfully to subscription revenue growth later in the year moving on content and other revenues were down  in the quarter due in part to difficult comparisons with our home entertainment releases in the quarter we recognized a comparable amount of revenues from our licensing agreement with amazon as we did in the yearago quarter while agreeing to expand our relationship to include the distribution of hbo now at our international networks including unconsolidated jvs we continue to see good subscriber growth though revenue declined due to foreign currency movements and the transfer of hbos basic service in india to turner adjusted operating income fell  in the quarter as we made significant investments in marketing and technology to support the launch of hbo now and given our plan to continue investing in customer acquisition we expect hbo now to generate losses for the remainder of this year and thats typical for an earlystage subscriber business even so were on track for another good year of adjusted operating income growth as we anticipate revenue trends to improve in the second half of the year and our early experience suggests that hbo now will be a highly profitable revenue stream for us over time moving on to warner bros which posted a record second quarter growing revenue  and adjusted operating income  and thats despite a significant drag from foreign exchange these results underscore our growing ability to monetize the best ip across a wide variety of platforms the biggest growth driver was our games business which posted its best quarter ever led by the strong performance of franchise releases batman arkham knight and mortal kombat x games revenue more than tripled passing  billion in the second quarter alone and with the great ip at warners disposal we remain optimistic about the longterm opportunity for this business on the tv side revenue increased over  due to strong growth in licensing fees that growth included the second cycle syndication of the big bang theory the svod licensing of seinfeld and an international license of friends all of which highlight the increasing value of hit content in our theatrical business revenues declined in the quarter despite modest growth from our film releases and that was a result of lower tv licensing of films and the timing of the home entertainment release of the latest installment of the hobbit franchise across theatrical and tv home entertainment revenue was down  that was due to the timing of the home entertainment release i just mentioned and softness in catalog even with that difficult comparison est revenue growth remained healthy increasing close to  and est growth for the industry was close to  helping offset a decline in physical sales that took consumer spending across the broader home entertainment industry down midsingle digits in the quarter so overall warner bros had a terrific quarter and is on pace for very attractive growth and a record year of adjusted operating income in  and with a great theatrical slate and momentum at our tv and games businesses were confident we can continue to drive solid growth in the coming years turning to the next slide free cash flow totaled  billion in the first half thats down from a year ago due to a significant swing in working capital but is still very healthy conversion growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased games and content revenues the timing of collections severance payments related to last years restructuring initiatives and increased content investments across our divisions cash interest increased modestly as a result of the additional debt we issued last year and our cash taxes declined primarily due to favorable tax legislation that was passed late in  looking ahead we continue to expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash for the full year than it was in  and that is mainly due to strong syndication revenues at warners and severance payments related to the restructuring actions taken in  despite that we anticipate  will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation now looking at our balance sheet we ended the second quarter with  billion of net debt up nearly  million from the end of  thats largely due to our ongoing commitment to direct shareholder returns in the first half of the year we returned a total of  billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases since our last call we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing  billion of longterm debt at attractive rates that included our first eurodenominated debt offering which will act as a natural hedge to the eurodenominated assets on our balance sheet we also retired  billion of debt as a result of the maturity of a tender offer we made for higherpriced debt and were in the process of redeeming the remaining  million of that series of debt our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately three times however excluding programming restructuring and severance charges from the second half of  our leverage ratio would have been  times slightly below our target leverage of  times we continue to believe that leverage target provides us the flexibility to invest in our businesses engage in strategic ma and provide direct returns to shareholders while at the same time optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios with that lets move on to the final slide which looks at our outlook for  we had a great first half of the year and were very pleased with the progress were making across our businesses that progress is evident in our results to date and our  outlook for adjusted eps of  to  which we have reaffirmed this morning as weve discussed with you previously that includes a foreign exchange headwind of approximately  based on current rates excluding that fx headwind our outlook would imply over  growth off last years base of  that outlook also includes ongoing investments at our network businesses in areas such as programming marketing and technology to strengthen our position within the rapidly changing ecosystem and those investments will be heavily weighted toward the back half of this year at turner well begin ramping up our content investments resulting in significantly higher programming costs and associated marketing expenses starting in the fourth quarter meanwhile at hbo we intend to continue investing in customer acquisition and technology for hbo now as we expand distribution and position the product for longterm success at warners we have challenging theatrical comparisons in the second half of the year still we anticipate healthy growth in the third quarter due to the syndication of two broke girls and person of interest as well as the continued benefit from our strong games slate taking the timing of our investment spending into account we expect our growth in adjusted eps will slow materially in the back half of the year even so we are on track for another year of very attractive growth in adjusted eps and we believe the investments were making in highquality content and the development of new business models will position us for accelerating growth in the future with that ill turn it over to mike to start the qa michael kopelman  senior vice presidentinvestor relations thanks howard amanda can you please open it up to qa id like to remind everybody to please limit yourself to one or two questions so we can get to more people amanda questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of michael nathanson from moffettnathanson your line is open please go ahead michael b nathanson  moffettnathanson llc thank you i have two one for richard and one for howard richard let me ask you about international over the past few months as netflix has rolled out into international markets there was a groundswell of opinion that thinks they can reach over  million subscribers in five years time are those projections close to being right and im going to ask you later to comment on those projections what does hbo need to do to benefit from the international opportunity and when can you roll out hbo now overseas to actually take advantage of what could be a gigantic market richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc we like our international strategy a lot michael as you know we have three tiers to it our operating networks in  countries our licensing deals in over  markets and our home of hbo deals and weve seen – as the value of content increases weve seen our profits increase nordics has been a very interesting case study for us though because it shows the power of a multilateral approach weve grown ott subs in nordic and weve grown our linear business so we look at that and we will be making announcements in the near future about new ott businesses but were going to take it on a casebycase basis were going to follow the money and were going to focus on profits as we always have done michael b nathanson  moffettnathanson llc okay let me ask one for howard as youve known two of your peers have reduced their public guidance for a variety of reasons including foreign exchange advertising subscriber growth do you still feel comfortable about the guidance you gave on eps in  and  you gave it back in october but i wonder have things changed enough for you to update the guidance howard m averill  executive vice president and chief financial officer you know what michael i appreciate the question and we are aware of some of the trends that you just talked about but unlike our annual outlook we dont change our update on longterm targets from quarter to quarter were very pleased about how were operating across all of our businesses and you can see that from the strong results we generated in the first half of this year and as we typically do were going to provide greater specificity on our longterm outlook at year end michael kopelman  senior vice presidentinvestor relations thanks michael amanda can we have our next question please operator our next question is from alexia quadrani from jpmorgan your line is open alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc hi thank you very much my question is on really your outlook for a step up in affiliate revenue growth in  now that youve completed or youre in the process of completing most of your renewals i guess what assumptions do you have in there in terms of sub declines or just sub outlooks in general and have you seen acceleration in declines i guess since you initially gave that guidance a little while ago john k martin  chairman  chief executive officer turner broadcasting system inc thanks alexia its john so listen again i appreciate the question i think if you go back to when we started to talk about domestic subscription revenue growth expectations weve been remarkably on track and i would say that were still very very much on track from our original expectations so last year we grew domestic subscriber revenue high single digits this year we expected that to moderate somewhat into midsingle digits and i fully expect well be able to hit that and then in  and then again in  we fully expect that to accelerate well into the teens and against that backdrop we have seen some modest unit declines in the us but i would say that that trend has been in existence and ongoing now for some time we have not seen any acceleration in those declines and those declines have not been overly material and of course that trend has really been in front of our inclusion in some of these more economically viable or skinny packages which we think over time as they become a little bit more mature might have the ability to stabilize the overall unit trends and possibly even return it to growth over time as we think the distributors ability to offer more economically but very attractive bundles to that element of the demand is only a positive thing and of course we at turner have the type of networks that we think will be overly represented in those type of bundles so we think the trends have been in existence for some time there has been no acceleration of any negative trends and were still really positive and optimistic about what the future holds jeffrey l bewkes  chairman  chief executive officer alexia this is jeff i just want to add i think everything john said and if you consider to the extent skinny bundles or smaller bundles become more prevalent and turner will be in those thats a good thing for hbo as well alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc okay just a quick followup if i may thank you for all the color you guys gave earlier in terms of your leverage targets and free cash flow one of your peers this morning mentioned that the rating agencies are weighing on the media industry more heavily now and getting a bit more strict in terms of the targets have you experienced that and does that change any of your priorities for use of cash howard m averill  executive vice president and chief financial officer are you talking about leverage ratios alexia alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc yes are the ratings agencies coming in a bit harder on you guys maybe putting you guys under a bit more scrutiny howard m averill  executive vice president and chief financial officer no i think weve had a pretty consistent process working with the rating agencies over time and we are in a good spot and feel confident about the leverage structure we have alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc thank you very much michael kopelman  senior vice presidentinvestor relations thanks alexia amanda can we have our next question please operator our next question comes from omar sheikh from credit suisse your line is open omar f sheikh  credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning everyone a question for richard first of all on hbo now i hear what you say on the comments you made on the level of demand i wondered if you might be able to just give us an idea of what kind of programming youre adding to the now product and are you seeing any change in the mvpd base is it primarily the pro bono  universe youre taking subs from some color on that will be very helpful and then a question for howard possibly on the turner programming expense growth for this year youve called out some of the investment that youll be making and the phasing of that in quarters but i wonder whether you could just update us on your fullyear expectations for programming expense growth this year thanks richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc omar hi its richard thank you for the question look its obviously early days but we are very excited by what weve seen with hbo now right out of the gate weve just added as you know amazon and google to apple youll see other products added in the near future and everything were seeing both from sampling and from subscriber satisfaction has exceeded our expectations with regard to any kind of cannibalization i can tell you as we predicted and as our research indicated weve seen less than  of hbo subs leave the bundle to go get hbo now which is exactly what we suspected was going to happen so while its very early we feel very good about it and we think hbo now will be very profitable in the coming quarters howard m averill  executive vice president and chief financial officer omar its howard in terms of the programming expense we do expect on a fullyear basis to be up modestly for the year but as i indicated in my prepared remarks its going to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter and i can let john provide any other insight on that john k martin  chairman  chief executive officer turner broadcasting system inc thanks listen thanks for the question weve been expecting for some time that on average in any given year we expect to hold down programming cost growth to on average no more than high single digits and so clearly in some years it will be higher in some years it will be lower this year in  it will be a year as howard just said with the expectation of growth only in the low single digits that it will be lower than the average in part thats due to the loss of nascar and before some of the new sports deals kick in in future years so for example programming costs in q will probably be down again because of the absence of nascar in the fourth quarter i think were currently planning on doubling the number of original series episodes compared to a year ago and theyll be a lot more heavily weighted to the scripted side versus nonscripted where it was a year ago too so the average cost per episode will be higher but were really excited about the programming cycle that were going to be beginning to enter which should be over a prolonged period so we think that that investment is very smart its wise and its going to be and will remain very much in control omar f sheikh  credit suisse securities europe ltd perfect thanks very much michael kopelman  senior vice presidentinvestor relations thanks omar amanda can we have the next question please operator our next question is from doug mitchelson from ubs your line is open douglas mitchelson  ubs securities llc thanks so much a couple topics for me as well i think first richard and jeff i was just hoping youd expound on what youve learned so far with the hbo now launch in the us i dont know if theres any contrast with what youve seen so far in the us versus your experience in the nordics which you highlighted has nice traction now with the conversion rate youre seeing from free app downloads to paid subs and any clarity or quantification to your willingness to spend on incremental marketing and programming that you discussed in your formal remarks thats the first topic richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc look i think whats clear to us is we have to make clear to first the lowhanging fruit which is the  million broadbandonly subscribers what hbo now is how much value is in there  hours of library all of our movie output and that is part of the marketing investment that were going to make the good news is that its pretty clear once people see the value as we explain it to them of whats in the hbo now package and what kind of versatility it provides them they are very very responsive to it so we need to make that investment going forward that marketing investment going forward so we can drive profits in hbo now and thats what we plan to do douglas mitchelson  ubs securities llc richard i guess im trying to figure out whether thats a pretty efficient digital spend because youre talking app downloads or whether you actually pursue traditional marketing highlighting your programming because then it helps both hbo and hbo now richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc its a little bit of both the spend is going to be both digital and in traditional television but quite obviously when were selling hbo now and all the brand components of it it also has a certain resonance for the brand itself and remember not only do we see a huge opportunity in the  million broadbandonly homes that is the lowhanging fruit but as weve said before there are  million people in the ecosystem that dont subscribe to hbo we want to go after that market as well with our partners and thats why we were very excited last week to see verizon wireless sign up for hbo now we think thats going to be followed by other distributors doing it its a huge opportunity for them to grow their businesses and as i said earlier less than  of the linear subscribers have left to go get hbo now so we see this as additive for our partners in the traditional business and we want to continue to drive that point because theres gold in the hills for them too douglas mitchelson  ubs securities llc and richard anything you want to offer for us on sub levels or conversion rate from free to paid richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc a little too early to do that i think but stay tuned douglas mitchelson  ubs securities llc all right this will be quick howard or jeff just let me try another way because i think not reaffirming longerterm guidance can be perceived negatively can you talk about what trends youre seeing that are more positive or more negative versus what you were expecting last october so perhaps investors can add up for themselves whether youre tracking ahead or behind the longterm guidance i know john already indicated if i heard him right no material change in affiliate fee revenues are there any other puts or takes that you would highlight at this point howard m averill  executive vice president and chief financial officer doug there are a lot of things out there that were seeing there are some positive and some negative you did hear us talk about the sub trends were very aware of the advertising profit look weve made some pretty good progress on the initiatives that we talked about last year as well so again it comes back to the fact that well give an update when we get closer to year end hopefully year end next year jeffrey l bewkes  chairman  chief executive officer other positive trends youve got very positive demand trends across the world for both content sales episode shows movies and for networks and thats a huge positive trend and youre seeing it in sub counts across the global environment youre seeing it in increased buying pressure pricing et cetera for content whether its in firstrun whether its in syndication or whether its in svod in fact all those things support each other and so what you see everybody talks a lot about for example svod or netflix internationally thats fine thats good but what that does is it leads to increased demand from other svod services it leads to increased demand from other incumbent networks all over the world and those are pretty positive i think we mentioned a number of things in the prepared remarks on overcoming fx and i think the way you opened your question is not something we totally agree with the timing is such were not going to make specific statements every quarter on very longterm guidance things are going very well for us if you look at  this year you had headwinds in foreign exchange of about  and yet here we are pulling in an earnings growth that essentially takes that into account i think we all expect just picking that fx as an ongoing situation for next year but if you look at what weve done this year that indicates actually from an operating point of view were ahead of the plan that we gave you so im not going to go farther because we have decisions to make about what we do year by year douglas mitchelson  ubs securities llc richard howard jeff thanks so much michael kopelman  senior vice presidentinvestor relations thanks doug amanda next question please operator our next question is from michael morris from guggenheim partners your line is open michael c morris  guggenheim securities llc thank you good morning guys two questions one you significantly increased i think the amount of content you made available on a stacked inseason basis to comcast can you talk about why you did that based on what you saw in the past what are the trends that youre seeing and whats your expectation for how you can capture incremental economics from making that available whether its on the affiliate side the ad side or both and then second with respect to the nba this season i think the nba is going to make outofmarket games available à la carte and its not on television its via broadband but still it is a step forward in people getting games how do you think about that product relative to the amount that youre investing in the national nba contract thanks jeffrey l bewkes  chairman  chief executive officer john will do the nba but can you go back are you asking about stacking rights and the extent of stacking rights from either a network like turner or from warner bros what was your question michael c morris  guggenheim securities llc so i think what i understand is that turner has made inseason stacked rights more broadly available to comcast in the coming year and theres a debate on whether that can cannibalize audience in the c window and therefore hurt your advertising whether you can capture more advertising and then of course whether or not you can capture and share in the value that the consumer gets through their payment to comcast or other distributors we can speculate on that but id rather hear from you why youre doing it and what you see john k martin  chairman  chief executive officer turner broadcasting system inc thanks for the question mike ill speak for turner maybe kevin can comment from the warners side we at turner have now for some time been very very much in favor of granting inseason stacking rights to distributors and affiliates for a number of reasons the first is we want to make sure that with respect to the original programming that we have on the network that were encouraging people who want to view these shows on a delayed basis that they can come in in the middle of the season and catch up and we think it increases the probability of having successful shows and will drive overall viewership not only for the shows that are stacked but also the shows later on in the season that are being viewed live so we think that that can help the advertising business for the live linear feed and we also think comcast for example probably the furthest along in the development of dynamic ad insertion we think dynamic ad insertion is a potential huge opportunity for us as network owners and for the industry at large as we think that delayed viewing as a currency will grow increasingly important over time so we intend to offer stacking rights on all the shows that we own and get rights for and we think its just a really really smart thing to do kevin tsujihara  chief executive officer warner bros entertainment inc i think you can make – this is kevin i think you can make the argument as john just did that it helps build the audience that it actually increases viewing in seasons two three four and five and i think from our perspective theres no diminution in the backend value of programs that have stacking rights and therefore between warner bros and turner were licensing those rights over to turner on every show we do with them with regard to the nba this isnt anything new this is something that they announced when we announced the new deal which we at turner were very much in favor of with respect to the nba having the rights to do this we love the partnership that we have with the nba we love the longterm visibility and sustainability that we have with respect to the rights but i think its really really important to understand that the games that will appear on our networks are exclusive to our networks so you will not be seeing those games appear anywhere else other than on tnt and of course were also in the business with the nba on our digital businesses and were a profit participant in that as well so i think what youre referring to is a reasonably limited outofmarket and i think it might even be potentially just a mobile product so we think for certain real basketball enthusiasts that will be particularly interesting but i dont necessarily believe its going to be a mainstream product michael c morris  guggenheim securities llc great thanks guys michael kopelman  senior vice presidentinvestor relations thanks michael amanda can we have our next question please operator our next question is from david bank from rbc capital markets your line is open david bank  rbc capital markets llc hey thanks very much for taking my question i guess i wanted to follow up on your comments earlier on the turner data cloud and i guess probably more specifically for john what he and david levy are doing in terms of their interest for ad tech at the turner platform what kind of investments are you making how are you thinking about it dynamic ad insertion as well as nonlinear platforms how do you see ad tech as a longterm value driver and how are you approaching it thank you john k martin  chairman  chief executive officer turner broadcasting system inc thanks david listen this is another area where we see huge opportunity going forward and i have to say this is an area – were talking a lot about the impact that technology is having on consumption but i think technology is moving so quickly and its going to have a dramatically positive impact on the efficacy of advertising on tv so youre right in the sense that we are making investments to strengthen our overall technology platform and you saw us introduce a number of advanced advertising products at this years upfront a few months ago whether its targeting now which allows an advertiser to optimize across tnt and tbs or a product called audience now which allows them to optimize across all turner networks with audience guarantees so were highly confident were going to be able to more efficiently manage and monetize all of our inventory across all of turner and its one of the reasons why we wanted to present all of turner in one meeting at the upfront because of the strength and the breadth of our brands we have a lot to learn as we move forward were working with some of our biggest partners and were roughly using  of our inventory for targeting but thats going to dramatically ramp in the future were investing in technology were investing in data weve come a long way over the last year and i think a lot of the capabilities that socalled digital companies have had an advantage of over tv are going to be eliminated as tv can not only provide targeting and increased reach and relevance but also in a very very immersive experience with longform video thats professionally produced so i think were in the very very early stages of seeing tv make a dramatic comeback on the attractiveness of advertising david bank  rbc capital markets llc have you seen – as you took targeting now into the marketplace at the upfront is there a way to quantify the upside on cpms that youre seeing from beginning to monetize this stuff john k martin  chairman  chief executive officer turner broadcasting system inc its an easy question difficult to answer because it depends flight by flight but i think even in the upfront itself weve announced for those advertisers that weve run campaigns for that weve seen doubledigit lifts in sales and that at the end of the day is whats really important is advertisers selling product david bank  rbc capital markets llc thanks very much michael kopelman  senior vice presidentinvestor relations thanks david amanda could we have our next question please operator our next question is from ben swinburne from morgan stanley your line is open benjamin swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc thank you good morning i have two questions kevin can you talk about the ageold debate about warners position selling to the broadcasters i think this year you guys actually saw some of your big customers own more of their own shows and i think theres some discussion in the market whether thats a structural change in the trajectory warner has been really well positioned as an independent when you look at it do you think the world is changing more vertical integration or is this just a blip in the trend line and then i have a followup for richard kevin tsujihara  chief executive officer warner bros entertainment inc i think that weve seen this go up and down since the change in the finsyn financial interest and syndication rules over time this is not a new concept with the networks wanting to own more and more of their programming but i think the key statistic that i would ask you to look at is for us is returning shows and this year we have more returning shows in  than in the history of warner bros so while we may not have sold as many shows into the marketplace as we would have typically have done we have more shows coming back than ever the pressure is always going to be on us to maintain our level of creative excellence but as we look at last year when we had two of the most successful shows in the flash and gotham we feel really good about our position in the marketplace our relationships with the key writerproducers that maintains our ability to be able to sell to every network were very proud of the fact that we have at least two shows on every single network and as i said we have more shows coming back than ever benjamin swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc that makes sense and then for richard and i dont know jeff if you want to answer as well when you scenario plan out hbo over the long term do you ever think about what a significant increase in content investment would do globally to the business in other words i think you spend about  billion a year is there a business model where that number doubles and you go big global more direct to consumer is there enough content out there to make it worth that kind of investment i realize you have guidance so youve got to work through all those pieces but im just wondering given how rapidly the world is changing do you ever think about what hbo could do if theres an opportunity to just get much more aggressive on the content side to build the longterm value of the business id be curious if you have any comments there richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc were always thinking about content opportunities and its one of the reasons internationally why weve invested a lot more in content both in latin america and asia and with our partners and remember some of our content for our international business like in nordic is joined with other peoples content that helps enhance the brand as far as our content spend here i like our mix a lot i think across genres you just saw  emmy nominations which one of the most important things about that is that it crossed different genres documentaries miniseries series halfhours hours so i like our spend were constantly looking at what opportunities there are as ive said over and over again and i think its true its not that more is better only better is better and so we want to make sure that were making the investment thats going to elevate the brand and thats going to continue to make an hbo subscription a musthave for people so thats how we think at it jeffrey l bewkes  chairman  chief executive officer let me add a little because i join richard in hbo from the past i dont think theres a shortage of content on hbo right now if you look at the amount of original series original programming on hbo theres more than in any other svod service in the world by a wide margin thats before you say that theres also a firstrun movie supply on hbo thats a tremendous part richard youve said its how much what percent richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc its over  of it jeffrey l bewkes  chairman  chief executive officer so youve got an svod service thats digital global its called hbo its got the most original programming its the only one with current movies so its got a big content advantage over most of the other alternatives the next thing if you start looking at sub growth at hbo you have the fact that some of the distributors have twice the penetration of other distributors that has nothing to do with content that has to do with marketing selling packaging making things available to consumers both here and around the world in a way thats affordable to them that has a good vod interface for them that is equally true of basic cable which has a tremendous content advantage if you look at the original shows or the hit acquired shows on channels like tbs tnt fx usa amc its a fantastic array of programming and all it needs is to be ondemand benjamin swinburne  morgan stanley  co llc thank you michael kopelman  senior vice presidentinvestor relations thanks amanda i think we have time for one last question operator yes sir our final question comes from the line of marci ryvicker from wells fargo your line is open marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc i actually have a really easy one for you you mentioned in your opening remarks that hbo india is being transferred to turner is there a reason for that richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc thats not true its the management of it its just scale its just scale jeffrey l bewkes  chairman  chief executive officer its just were comarketing it and codistributing  richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc its to be more efficient with our resources and management and its scale in the marketplace jeffrey l bewkes  chairman  chief executive officer exactly marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc and so whats the financial impact between the two segments richard l plepler  chief executive officer home box office inc i dont know off the top of my head i dont think its over  howard do you know howard m averill  executive vice president and chief financial officer its low tens of millions of dollars over the course of the year against hbo marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc got it okay thanks michael
