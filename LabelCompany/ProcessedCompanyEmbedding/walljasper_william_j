walljasper sits down for candid interview the wall street journal interview says company cut down on franchising initiatives august    pm new york  william j walljasper senior vice president and chief financial officer of casey’s general stores sat down with the wall street journal for an interview than delved into the company’s unique approach to the industry starting with a single store in iowa in  the company now operates in nine states boasting over  locations with the majority of the stores located in rural communities of  residents of less walljasper told the paper we serve not only as the gas station but also in many cases the grocery store and restaurant this is a twofold strategy as it sets the stage for less competition from a convenience store perspective as well as a quickserve restaurant perspectivewith a onesizefitsall approach casey’s brand explained walljasper is further defined by its food service offerings some of the things that differentiate our company in the convenience store industry would be the fact that we do have a proprietary prepared food program we make from scratch not only pizza but donuts as well and offer a wide variety of other products in fact we are a top  retailer of pizza and donuts in the nationin addition the company also owns all its assets which is unique in the business and it selfdistributes approximately  percent of the grocery products in its stores walljasper said it comes out of our distribution center centrally located here at corporate headquarters he told the wall street journal in recent years the company cut down on its franchising initiatives walljasper explained that as of april   the company has  franchise locations compared to the approximate  locations it once had we started franchising back in the s as a way to grow critical mass we didnt have the capital to grow at that point we haven’t issued a new franchise since we went public back in  he told the paper since that point we have purchased many of those stores back and converted them over to corporate locations and we will be out of the franchise business at the end of this calendar year all remaining franchise agreements will expire by the end of the calendar yearas with all cstore retailers escalating gas prices are causing problems and issues for casey’s gasoline consumption walljasper said is down by roughly two percent however given that coupled with a little more challenging economic time nationwide our samestore customer count continues to be very solid he continued people are still coming into our stores they are still buying the soda or the cup of coffee or donut or a slice of pizza or whatever they are buying…they are filling up with fewer gallons per stop which means they are coming back perhaps a little bit more often

j walljasper senior vice president and chief financial officer of caseys general stores inc nasdaqcasy key excerpts follow twst we would like to begin with a brief historical sketch of the company and a picture of the things you are doing now mr walljasper we opened our first store back in  and since then we have grown from one store in the state of iowa to encompass a ninestate area of the states here in the midwest currently we have over  locations we are really unique in the convenience store industry and with our business model locating stores in smaller rural communities throughout the midwest the majority of our stores are in towns of person population or less we serve not only as the gas station but also in many cases the grocery store and restaurant some of the things that differentiate our company in the convenience store industry would be the fact that we do have a proprietary prepared food program we make from scratch not only pizza but donuts as well and offer a wide variety of other products in fact we are a top  retailer of pizza and donuts in the nation we also own all of our assets which is unique in the business and selfdistribute about  of the grocery products in our store it comes out of our distribution center centrally located here at corporate headquarters twst would you tell us more about the reasons for the companys success mr walljasper i think it all starts back when we actually opened our first store the next two stores actually were in communities of smaller populations than our first i think at that point we found a niche of servicing some of the smaller rural communities that havent had this type of service before so in that regard being located in smaller communities there is less competition not only from a convenience store perspective but less competition from a quickserve restaurant perspective from an entrylevel labor perspective lower cost to build and even lower cost to purchase when we go under acquisition strategy so it has been a nice evolving product we are very vertically integrated and we have stayed vertically integrated since the start of the company and i think thats a good reason for the success that we have also by nature the company has been what i will call relatively conservative and i think thats been a very positive thing for the company not growing just for the sake of growing but having to manage that growth plan we have very low debt a very strong balance sheet in fact we would be considered investment grade so i think all those components kind of rolled up sum up the success of our company twst i believe that you used to have a number of franchises why have you cut down on franchising mr walljasper that is correct we currently at least as of april   have  franchise locations we used to have over  franchise locations we started franchising back in the s as a way to grow critical mass we didnt have the capital to grow at that point we havent issued a new franchise since we went public back in  since that point we have purchased many of those stores back and converted them over to corporate locations and we will be out of the franchise business at the end of this calendar year all remaining franchise agreements will expire by the end of the calendar year twst how is the price of gas  affecting you mr walljasper the price of gas certainly has been more of a challenging issue here recently its affecting us in several ways first of all gasoline consumption — its no secret that gasoline consumption nationwide has been down over the last year somewhere around  to  our samestore gallons over the most recent fiscal year we completed ending april   were down  we have seen some elasticity in demand with gas gallons however given that coupled with a little more challenging economic time nationwide our samestore customer count continues to be very solid people are still coming into our stores they are still buying the soda or the cup of coffee or donut or a slice of pizza or whatever they are buying they are continuing that process they are filling up with fewer gallons per stop which means they are coming back perhaps a little bit more often to our stores twst what are the main opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for you mr walljasper i think the opportunities for us stem from a comment i made earlier about the fragmented nature of our market area just to reiterate about twothirds of the convenience stores in our market area operate with  stores or less which means they have a different critical mass than we do and a different infrastructure than we do we purchase direct from the vendors we dont go through a food broker which gives us some buying power in that regard we also have a very strong balance sheet which enables us to get very good credit and payable terms for example with gasoline several years ago a load of gasoline would cost   now a load of gasoline is somewhere between  and  we turn our gasoline about every three days and our payment terms are  days i am pretty confident that some of the smaller operators would not have that same type of payment term its been quite frankly a crunch on working capital for some of the smaller operators so that creates an acquisition opportunity anytime there is pressure in our industry i believe it creates opportunities to perhaps purchase some of the operators that dont have the same type of structure that we do so the opportunities in that regard going forward from within are not only our ninestate market area but we also did a warehouse expansion several years ago which will enable us to add another  stores above the ones we currently have which means that we may look to go into other states that border our current market areas states such as michigan ohio kentucky tennessee and arkansas those are states that we are looking to penetrate and i think there are opportunities to be had in those states about this

biggest changes ahead for the college and university dining segment case study caseys general store ankeny ia published on sunday  october  written by lisa white contributing editor competing in the crowded pizza segment is a challenge for any restaurant let alone a retail convenience store chain yet caseys general store a store chain based in ankeny ia has more than competed — it has thrived the caseys preparedfood operation represents nearly  percent of the chains total gross profit dollars and is one of the highest gross profit contributors even topping fuel sales its flagship pizza is so popular with customers in the  midwestern states the chain serves that caseys will soon offer a delivery program in terms of the number of retail outlets we are a top  retailer of pizza and cake donuts in the country says william j walljasper senior vice president and cfo we sell a lot of prepared food part of caseys success can be attributed to the retailers business model which includes stores primarily in small rural communities about  percent of our locations are in towns with  people or less and  percent of our stores are in areas with populations of  or less walljasper says this has helped insulate caseys against competition from bigbox retailers the chain which has been in business since  has offered prepared food since the early s yet unlike many of its wouldbe competitors caseys operates kitchens that are on site instead of being centralized caseys new o store design has helped expand its foodservice program even further with the addition of madetoorder subs and more freshbaked products the chain also recently expanded its coffee bar to offer a wider variety of flavor profiles including cappuccino and iced coffee in addition the company added selfservice softserve ice cream about two years ago this new store prototype has expanded the caseys footprint to  square feet from  square feet about half of the squarefoot addition is dedicated to prepared food walljasper says the other half is geared toward cooler space and seating although caseys has been expanding its preparedfood menu pizza remains the focus as a result the chain continually adds new pizza varieties to the mix in the last year bacon chicken ranch mac and cheese and buffalo chicken varieties were introduced cstores are looking for products to meet customer demand yet our menus are not only about product selection but also are based on convenience walljasper says quality is the main focus of caseys pizza program its pies are made from scratch on site using  percent wholemilk mozzarella cheese caseys menu also includes subs which are offered in  locations along with a variety of other sandwiches chicken tenders and bakery items newly added menu items include quesadillas and a togo cup with snacks including freshbaked mini chocolate chip cookies our older sites offer a full menu with the exception of madetoorder sub sandwiches says darryl f bacon vice president food services the chain has also cobranded through acquisitions as a result approximately a dozen stores are adjacent to blimpie and aw quickserve restaurants its not something were looking to expand upon walljasper says when we acquire locations we evaluate adjacent foodservice operations to see if we want to continue with the cobrand there are times we decide its not in our best interest caseys foodservice operations have more than proven they are strong enough to stand on their own the kitchen equipment lineup includes a conveyor oven a mixer a donut fryer three food warmers dough rollers and two prep tables for pizza and sub production all equipment is tested before its purchased were looking at remodeling our existing stores to include expanded coffee stations and madetoorder subs bacon says caseys has completed  major store renovations which are being evaluated for efficiency the chain also continuously evaluates new equipment for its stores most equipment has improved over the years such as the conveyor ovens which offer pushbutton controls instead of dials bacon says the one thing weve noticed an improvement on is the dough rollers in the past workers would experience injuries such as cut fingers now its almost impossible to get injured on this equipment when purchasing equipment ease of use durability and warranties are critical our equipment has to be userfriendly for our store operations as well as be easy to maintain at the store level walljasper says from a retail perspective having the appropriate products available at the right times can be a big challenge typically stores have items like breakfast sandwiches and pastries out from  to  am lunch offerings are featured until  pm product is only held in warmers for an hour each store has an hourly production planner who determines when and how much prepared food will be available business intelligence software is also utilized for this task the intent is to make sure we have the right products out at the appropriate times of day to meet customer demand bacon says we want to avoid throwing product out or missing sales opportunities despite the economic downturn caseys has been averaging about  percent samestore sales growth in foodservice over the last five years and doubledigit samestore sales movement in the last few months the economy has hurt the restaurant business more than it has affected us walljasper says the midwest agricultural economy is robust and we believe this has resulted in more consumer confidence in our demographic areas new additions to the foodservice program include seating in  stores and testing pizza delivery in six locations caseys is also evaluating the expansion of its bakery offerings to include pies cakes and more breads in every store — whether its new remodeled or acquired — we evaluate the potential of an expanded coffee bar madetoorder sandwiches and pastries walljasper says even though its outoftheway locations keep competition at bay caseys has built its success on making its prepared food a destination for its customers our companys preparedfood operation is not just an afterthought walljasper says its a
