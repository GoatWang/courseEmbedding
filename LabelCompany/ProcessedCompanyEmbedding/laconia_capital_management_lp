estimates peg the number of internet of things iot devices deployed in the market to be between  to  billion and that number is expected to grow over  times in the next  years to illustrate an example of an iot device imagine a parking spot with sensors installed these sensors send data on the availability of that parking spot to a local internetenabled gateway that ultimately communicates the information to the car drivers through their navigation systems in that vicinity – in this case and in any similar scenario in which sensors enable communication between physical objects and internetenabled systems we are talking about iot devices the market opportunity for saas companies within iot becomes huge once these devices become more pervasive today the primary market opportunity for saas companies is centered around enterprise web and mobile sectors with industries more skewed toward modern nontraditional non brickandmortar sectors that market is less than  billion with iot devices many traditional industries such as energy utilities in general construction transportation and the environment will be ushered in the st century of connectivity that means stakes are much higher as these multibillion dollar industries are much bigger than the modern enterprises there is a reason ge calls iot the industrial internet of things iiot not only that we anticipate that iot will bring brand new challenges – which subsequently pave the way for opportunities – for current and next generation saas companies to build services and products for example current generation

amaze me is the lack of relationship building skills that so many entrepreneurs seem to have while growing up my parents hammered into me the courteousness and importance of writing thank you notes during the early days of my career i was shown how to build a business relationship and most importantly how to maintain one thank you notes were a cornerstone of relationship maintenance and this was all before there were emails and texts to make the process so damn fast and easy entrepreneurs work so hard building businesses they identify opportunities draft business strategies hire people develop technology raise capital and sell sell and sell yet through it all they seem to treat relationship building like a speed bump on the road to success it seems most people today do not understand how a simple email can leave a door open for future opportunities that might not seem obvious at the time i tell my entrepreneurs and my three children to try and do the following as religiously as they can send an email to the people you have spoken to or met with by the end of that day if it is a very important meeting go the extra mile and draft a handwritten thank you note yes write an actual paper thank you note you would be shocked by someone’s reaction when they actually get a hand written thank you note talk about going old school and positively differentiating yourself when someone connects you with another person circle back with them and let them know how the new interaction went so many times i will connect someone to one of my contacts and then feel like the intro fell into a black hole follow up with people who make introductions for you and let them know you met with their contacts and how it went then thank them again a consistent followup will more likely encourage additional introductions keep your contacts updated on your progress why keep news to yourself or only for those who tell you what you want to hear share good news relationships might begin during an appropriate request such as when looking for a new job funding customer introductions etc but it is the post initial communication that builds life long relationships content raven

httpwwwlaconiacapitalgroupcom valuation too many seedstage entrepreneurs think carelessly about valuation they see it as merely a means to protect themselves from dilution or worse as a representation of current achievement the reality is that valuation represents a commitment to future achievement investors don’t care what you did yesterday or today they care what you are going to do tomorrow entrepreneurs should see current valuations for what they are a pricing spread based upon a current discount to a future valuation this is a future valuation they will need to reach keep in mind that the goal post continually moves until there is an exit fall short of the spread and your financing ability dies along with your company a high valuation may feel good and allow an entrepreneur to boast at cocktail parties but the astute entrepreneur sees its potential to be a gun to the head building companies is not a linear curve of progress operating flexibility is needed and the higher the valuation the less flexibility sophisticated vcs understand this yes we don’t want to over pay and potentially hurt our roi but we also don’t want to invest in a company that has no wiggle room to adapt entrepreneurialism is an iterative process of constant intelligence gathering and execution capital structure including valuation must accommodate this process vcs also know that too much dilution to the entrepreneur kills incentive no vc wants an unmotivated founder the simple fact is that entrepreneurs who build great companies in partnership with vcs of integrity get richly rewarded a correct valuation should reflect a targeted and achievable operating plan aligned with a strategic capital plan valuation must be milestone driven successful entrepreneurs ask what milestone needs to be achieved in order to trigger the subsequent financing event after the current round capital planning should not be an afterthought to operations laconia capital group lp announces late seedstage bb venture capital fund new york new york – january   – laconia capital group lp announces the launch of a new businesstobusiness venture capital fund the new fund utilizes an investment approach described as “inflection capital investing” through which laconia will invest in late seedstage companies that have reached an inflection point in their business development that strongly suggests continued growth attractive future funding rounds and current tangible value companies reaching laconia’s inflection point have an inmarket product existing primary revenue stream relatively light future capital requirements and a valuation that reflects the current asset value rather than a hockey stick projection these companies typically need late seedstage financing to further build

flow problems in the marketing services data management mobile communications publishing media sports and entertainment industries contact jeffrey silverman jeffreylaconiacapitalgroupcom  park avenue south rd floor new york ny   treat your first investor meeting like a first date a friend has made the introduction you have wanted to meet this person for sometime thanks to the internet you search all about them wanting to learn anything that can give you insight into who they are what they like and what gets them excited you visit their linkedin page facebook page check out their latest tweets see if they have written any blogs and find any news articles about them the information can be overwhelming and take the excitement out of the unknown but being prepared is so important no matter your gender or sexual preference everyone gets nervous about a first date it starts with what to wear you want to look respectful and dress appropriate for the occasion there is no worse feeling then being the most over dressed or under dressed person in a room as you head towards your date so much is running through your mind how do i start the conversation do i really open up about the weather should i talk about the big sports game last night what happens if they are not a sports fan or a fan of that team breaking the ice is tough and both sides know why they are there your mind drifts to chemistry will you connect with this person will they like you will they get who you are or will they see you as someone totally different how do you come off confident but not cocky how do they learn about you without you monopolizing the conversation oh boy – the conversation you sit across from them and have so much you want to say you try to sit up straight and not fidget with your hands this is not their first date nor yours but they seem to have all the control as to whether or not there will be a second date you want to tell them just enough that they will want to see you again but you also do not want to scare them away or overwhelm them what will be enough information to peak their interest for a second date you want to open the door wide enough for them to see how great you are but at the same time demonstrate that you’re able to listen yet you’d like to learn more about them than what you discovered from your internet search you ask yourself would they be a good partner is our thinking in unison would they help balance out your weaknesses the date comes to an end did you get across to them what was needed in order to secure that second date how do you follow up but not look desperate is a thank you email appropriate a phone call do you go old school and write a handwritten note you remind yourself that if this does not work out there are many fish in the sea each date is a learning opportunity to becoming a casa nova entrepreneur learn from past dates and incorporate that learning into future ones you can laugh about the analogy but it is  true a first meeting with a vc is just like a first date treat it that way from how you dress to how much you would say and listen do not go for the close a vc will not write a check after a first meeting as in dating each side must get to know each other and see if there is a real future there or is it just a one and done david arcara – laconia capital group skip to content laconia capital group inflection capital

valuation too many seedstage entrepreneurs think carelessly about valuation they see it as merely a means to protect themselves from dilution or worse as a representation of current achievement the reality is that valuation represents a commitment to future achievement investors don’t care what you did yesterday or today they care what you are going to do tomorrow entrepreneurs should see current valuations for what they are a pricing spread based upon a current discount to a future valuation this is a future valuation they will need to reach keep in mind that the goal post continually moves until there is an exit fall short of the spread and your financing ability dies along with your company a high valuation may feel good and allow an entrepreneur to boast at cocktail parties but the astute entrepreneur sees its potential to be a gun to the head building companies is not a linear curve of progress operating flexibility is needed and the higher the valuation the less flexibility sophisticated vcs understand this yes we don’t want to over pay and potentially hurt our roi but we also don’t want to invest in a company that has no wiggle room to adapt entrepreneurialism is an iterative process of constant intelligence gathering and execution capital structure including valuation must accommodate this process vcs also know that too much dilution to the entrepreneur kills incentive no vc wants an unmotivated founder the simple fact is that entrepreneurs who build great companies in partnership with vcs of integrity get richly rewarded a correct valuation should reflect a targeted and achievable operating plan aligned with a strategic capital plan valuation must be milestone driven successful entrepreneurs ask what milestone needs to be achieved in order to trigger the subsequent financing event after the current round capital planning should not be an afterthought to operations laconia capital group lp announces late seedstage bb
