apr  by johan  no comments a lot has changed since the ’s when product was king in the same way we need to change the way we approach potential new prospects driving them to become clients we are living in a world where change is happening at a rapid p ace where consumers are spoilt for choice and turn a deaf ear to your product specs and benefits especially if the latter is long winded the only way to successfully sell a product or service in this day and age is to sell using higher levels of abstraction   we need to approach every marketing tactic with a creative streak – research conducted by neuroinsight discovered that consumers no longer view advertisements and sales pitches through typical traditional lenses but rather respond to marketing communication if it’s creative and emotive by nature traditional gender roles and other demographics such as race and age don’t play as big a role in decision making as they used to   blatantly selling product features and focus on the product only puts you at risk of being forgotten and being ‘filtered as spam’ in the mind of the client neuroinsight discovered that overly complicated facts and scientific information is forgotten by consumers the quickest   new research has highlighted something we’ve all secretly known consumers buy products if they appeal to their emotions and make them feel a certain way features and price help us come up with a logical excuse for our purchasing behaviours however behavioral economics professor and bestselling author dan ariely states that a person’s literacy and logic don’t change a person’s attitude or buying behaviour purchase decisions are felt at a higher level of abstraction and for this reason emotional intelligence trumps the information itself this is true if we think about impulse purchases we’ve made in the past regardless of what’s in our back pocket tom snyder mentioned in his speech at the aaisp’s inside sales leadership summit that every decision we make is due to our emotions it’s also very important to try tune into a client’s belief system or personality type as it is instrumental to the way we understand and interpret our emotions and the way we make sense of life any salesperson entering the market today needs to have an emotional and personal connection with a product offeringg to make it believable and to add real value with impact   if you don’t believe in your product your client will think you’ll say anything to get them on the hook so you’ll get your commission your lack of spiritual intelligence will convey this message without you even being aware of the communication to your prospect focusing on and your personal development in becoming mindful of the situation and the environment will guide your sales pitch and the more you tap into that person’s environment and feelings the more encouraging your product will sound and the greater level of success you’ll achieve through building trust and belief the product itself shouldn’t be your main focus you need to sell the product’s benefits – how the product will make the prospect feel when they use it or how they would feel without the product     interaction with your prospect is very important view your sales pitch as a conversation where you can truly engage with the prospect and obtain as much information as possible  asking lots of questions and showing interest in the client’s feedback makes them feel valued and builds strong rapport   aligning your product benefit with the client’s emotion will make a sale an enjoyable experience and a sure thing here’s how to tap into these emotions   greed focus on the personal advantages the client will get from your product offering – how will this make the client look what will our product do for them safety in numbers – it’s important to speak facts such as the roi your product proves to achieve – what will the client get back show how your product can advance the client’s career and benefit the organization he or she represents fear show the negative consequences of the client will face if they don’t consider your product allude to how not taking your product could have a negative effect on them personally show the client that they don’t have the luxury of time and not to act altruism show how your product will be good for others the team show them what your product can do for their company in the bigger picture envy allude to supplying the competition – if your competitors use us shouldn’t you present industry reports trends to the client pride show the client how your product will make them look show them how your product will increase their popularity in the industry or grant them exposure     stop focusing on selling the product the way to be a successful salesperson today is all about creating an emotional experience with the client engaging with them in a meaningful way with maximum rapport the point where your product features and benefits pair with a consumer’s emotion is the sweet spot in any sale   kind regards the gyroscope executive coaching research  development team       continue reading previous             next search here can you picture

logisticsthe sweet taste of growth in the south african chocolate retail industry the south african chocolate retail industry as a result of international inclinations seems to be bulletproof although the industry is currently dominated by the larger role players what impact does the individual’s search for a unique chocolate experience mean for the industry “chocolate is one of those products that is recession proof the market is still growing at around  per year” these are the words of cathal queally brand manager of the south african based company chocolate direct industrysurvey  given the current global financial climate one does not seem to find this kind of reaction in many retail industries worldwide however on closer inspection it seems that queally’s description on the chocolate retail industry to be “recession proof” is more than reliable the constant growth in retail figures owes thanks to a few key aspects the first of which is the increasing awareness of chocolate’s health benefits franchisehelp    health benefits research over the past decade has proven that the presence of antioxidants found in darker chocolate chocolate containing more than  cocoa could prevent or delay the development of cardiac medical diseases the famous medical doctor and television personality dr oz argues that “dark chocolate keeps one looking and feeling younger as it helps control blood pressure avoids wrinkles and keeps one’s skin younger and slimmer” this medical breakthrough has caused increased sales of dark chocolate which in turn has led to an increase in the demand to cacao franchisehelp  cocoa demand according to the article published by franchise help chocolate industry analysis  – cost  trends the increased demand to cacao seems to be met with poor supply  the reasons therefor are threefold firstly  of total cocoa production originates from west african countries due to the politically unstable nature of these countries resulting in sporadic outbreaks of war the international supply of cocoa seems to be subdued at times although the expansion of supply to different parts of the world seems imminent the international cocoa organisation explains that it takes up to five years for a new cocoa plant to yield its first crop this results in expansion of supply being a timely process franchisehelp  secondly the supply of cocoa is under a great deal of stress due to global warming the international centre for tropical agriculture has issued a warning that at the current rate of temperature increase west african countries may experience an increase of average temperature of degree celsius by  as argued in the article future of the chocolate industry looks sticky barnato and graham explains that the temperature in west african countries by  might be too high for cocoa crops to grow as trees could struggle to obtain enough water barnato and graham  finally barnato and graham argue that due to the high level of child labour utilised within the harvesting of cocoa crops delays are experienced in the supply of cocoa due to protest action based upon the ethical matter surrounding child labour there are reportedly more than  million children working in the cocoa harvesting industry   of which under “exploitative conditions” barnato and graham  these reasons have led to global cocoa production decreasing from  million tonnes in  to  million tonnes in  franchisehelp  barnato and graham  this inevitably resulted in an increase in cocoa price and subsequently the price of chocolate to the end user according to franchise help consumers do not mind the increase in the price of chocolate as it is seen as an “affordable luxury” franchisehelp  indirectly concurring on queally’s views as set out above industry growth the global chocolate retail industry grew by  between  and  hitting the  billion mark barbato and graham  with the usa occupying the largest portion at  billion franchisehelp  the reasons therefor are twofold firstly over the past decade asian pacific countries have shown a growing interest in chocolate franchisehelp  as these countries get increasingly more accustomed to “western tastes” their demand for chocolate has grown to such an extent that the impact thereof on global sales may increase with approximately  by  franchisehelp  secondly one has to consider the emergence of niche chocolatier chocolate stores who create unique and individualised products franchisehelp  alternatively known as retail chocolate stores these are defined as stores that retail exclusive chocolates to consumers who focus on premium and seasonal sweets watt  in her article chocolate retailers to grow through  watt argues that although the majority of chocolate sales emerge from the grocery store sphere  exclusive chocolate stores are experiencing growth due to the rise in individuals’ disposable income combined with their high demand for premium chocolate  according to watt the international chocolate sensation lindt showed to most growth under these circumstances  south african context parallel to the international market the south african chocolate retail industry valued at r billion is highly secure with cadbury nestlé and beacon controlling  of total sales insightsurvey  considering that  thereof emerge from chocolate slabs the leading south african brands are currently cadbury’s dairy milk lunch bar ps and chomp as well as nestlé’s bar one and kitkat insightsurvey  according to the international snack manufacturer mondelēz south africa will be responsible for  of the global chocolate growth by  insightsurvey  although these role players are currently occupying the local market since  south africa saw a growing amount of private chocolatiers creating unique dark vegan spicy and fruity speciality chocolates according to the sa chocolate industry landscape report as published by insight survey it becomes apparent that niche chocolatiers are eroding the market share of big role players  kees beyers argues in the report that this is due to the eradication of import duty on raw materials combined with the consumer’s association of small speciality chocolates with quality good service and attention to detail inightsurvey  conclusion the south african chocolate retail industry currently parallels the international horizon although there exist intercontinental factors that may cause an increase in the price of chocolate to the end user the nature of the industry seems to accept this fate better than others through the course of this article it had become apparent that the consumer is constantly searching for a unique chocolate experience even though this might have detrimental effects on the larger role players within the industry it currently ensures a brighter future for the individual chocolatiers  jun  butlers point of sale logistics the future of the village pharmacy the pharmaceutical retail industry is still subdued after the global financial crisis however the industry has introduced various methodologies endeavouring to rectify the situation at hand although the introduction of online pharmaceuticals and automated dispensers has brought about a marginal level of relief to the industry it has led to severe consequences for the traditional community pharmacies the pharmaceutical retail industry pri consists of businesses that retail prescription medications patent drugs cosmetics and toiletries this industry is merely one subdivision of the overarching retail trade rt industry bankwest  while the international consumption levels of pharmaceutical products have stabilised following the global financial crisis gfc there remains organic factors that are keeping the consumption of pharmaceuticals passive compared to the powerful upswing recorded between  and  bankwest  according to statistics released by the world bank south africa had an average yearly spending rate of  per capita on pharmaceutical and healthcare products in said time period dataworldbankorg following the gfc families are struggling to manage and structure their salary expenditure in an everlasting attempt to afford the increasing costs of not only pharmaceutical products but all additional living costs bankwest  based upon the annual  increase in the price of pharmaceuticals within south africa  healthcom the average south african household can not afford to spend more than merely  of their total income on pharmaceutical and healthcare products  statssa as a result this has caused a major setback to the south african pharmaceutical retail industry in order for the pri to attempt sustainable growth the industry has introduced various different methodologies to bring down the price of pharmaceutical products to the end user although this might be advantageous to the end user it may have detrimental consequences for the traditional community pharmacy the first of these methodologies being the “online pharmacy’ online pharmacy seen as the next “big challenge” parliamentary changes combined with higher demand from “convenience focussed” consumers could potentially cause havoc to the traditional community pharmacies bankwest  in robert whitaker’s article buying pills on the net he argues that the success behind the online pharmaceutical market resides within the aspect of convenience whitaker  he explains that purchasing medication online offers the client the opportunity to not only conduct their business from the comfort of their own home but provides them with the opportunity to “shop around” for the cheapest available option whitaker  mark davison opposes whitaker’s views by arguing that the online pharmaceutical trade has major concerns one of which being the outdated and substituted medications that are often sent to the end user as a result of the lack of reliable pharmacists’ input support and advise davison   remote dispensing machines an alternative approach endeavouring to support growth within the pharmaceutical retail industry is born from the recent successful trials in remote dispensing machines fitzgerald  these machines are used to describe automated dispensing systems that package and label prescription medications as well as cosmetics and toiletries without an onsite pharmacist in their journal article can telepharmacy provide pharmacy services in the bush nissen and tett argue that although the same elements of convenience apply to these machines as to the online pharmacy this method of attaining pharmaceutical products has its own set of challenges that requires further investigation they claim that these machines place a barrier between the pharmacist and the patient that could potentially lead to fatal consequences nissen  tett   they explain in an example that a patient with alcohol on the breath will go unnoticed by the remote dispenser this might cause fatal interactions between the alcohol and various medications such as sleeping tablets tranquilisers and narcotics nissen  tett   louise slabbert south african based doctor of dentistry concurs on the views as set out by nissen and tett her principle concern with both the automated dispensing system and the online pharmacy is more focused on the effects of dispensing medication without the presence of a pharmacist that is familiar with the patient and hisher family’s medical background slabbert  conclusion although the pri has taken some drastic measures to ensure sustainable growth it seem that although these measures might be detrimental to the community pharmacies the abovementioned systems are still far from acting as a replacement for the community pharmacy but the question that still remains is an ethical one – can the pri afford to rid the bond of trust between pharmacist and patient  mar  aquila d’oro coffee roastery top baristas spill the beans in a world gone coffee crazy we are all in search of that perfect cup of coffee but there’s no shame in having untrained pallet sometimes we need a little help from the experts themselves in true eat pray love fashion our group marketing division went in search of answers how we too could recreate perfect cups of coffee to satisfy our growing coffee need here’s what we discovered rule the roast the freshness of the beans you use has a major impact on the taste you’ll enjoy shawn steiman of coffea consulting says beans are at their best three weeks after roasting coffee lovers need to pay close attention to “roasted on” dates and support smaller artisan roasters that only roast to order in search of freshness it is better to buy from roasters who roast to order or roast in small volumes in supermarkets coffee can stand on the shelf for weeks or months compromising the freshness of the coffee consumers should never assume coffee is fresh just because it comes from a retail outlet quick tip fans of darker roasts should split large orders as darker roasts oxidize quicker   pure water anson goodge head trainer at ozone coffee roasters in london believes that using filtered water or even bottled water opposed to conventional tap water influences the quality of the coffee significantly filtered water removes sediment and chlorine from water and also reduces the total hardness th of the water which influences cup quality and bean extraction using conventional tap water you also run the risk of limescale build up which is harmful to your health and can also damage your machine expert coffee roasters jazmin  christian medrano of brew brew in chicago suggest heating filtered water between  °c to  °c for the perfect brew this temperature allows for better diffusion during the percolating process and enhances the coffee flavour more effectively than cooler water beware of using water that exceeds  °c as this will bring out bitterness in the bean which you don’t want     refrigeration myth contrary to what you may have heard keeping your coffee grounds in the fridge or deep freeze is probably the worst thing you can do keeping coffee in a cold moist environment speeds up the aging process and draws in unfavourable smells into your coffee coffee should be kept in a cold dry temperaturestable environment away from direct sunlight in an opaque container preferably todd goldsworthy us brewers cup champion says it’s important to keep your coffee airtight to prevent oxidation that will compromise bean quality quick tip expert coffee roasters jazmin  christian medrano store their beans in a “dark coloured ceramic or glass container” for ultimate freshness   good grind it’s important to only grind the beans you will be using right away as pregrinding leads to flavourless coffee when used at a later stage katie cargiuilo winner of the  us championship urges coffee lovers to buy whole beans and swears that barista enthusiasts need to grind their own beans if they want to create and recreate perfect cups of coffee choose the correct grinder – stay away from blade grinders that burn grains and leave inconsistent grounds as this influences the extraction process of the bean when brewed quick tip for a stronger coffee taste don’t add more coffee rather grind the beans finer to increase the surface area of the bean to release more flavour   nice device many people don’t know that different blends should be brewed in different ways to bring out the best flavour of the bean mocha java and blue mountain for example because of their fruity undertones using a pour over machine with a metal filter is the most appropriate method for brewing smooth wellbalanced blends are best suited for a bean to cup or espresso machine blends with a sweet undertone are a perfect match for a plunger expert pick katie cargiuilo winner of the  us championship swears by ceramic drippers for a homebrew single cup soloution she mentioned that in her experience plastic drippers “underextract your coffee as it cools down” because plastic drippers are unable to effectively trap heat whilst brewing quick tip when using a drip machine use metal filters these filters allow small coffee particles and oils into your cup of coffee whilst percolating and create a fuller body coffee for more distinct flavours make use of paper filters that prevent the filtration of those coffee particles and oils brown paper filters are not recommended as they tend to give coffee an undesirable taste practice proportions nat fried one of canadas top baristas says consistency is one of the most important elements in creating a great cup of coffee you have to practice your proportions learn the correct coffee to water ratio and length of brew to recreate the perfect cup of coffee don’t over scoop use accurate measuring tools such as a scale with a decimal point to ensure you are using the correct amount of coffee every time quick tip for darker blends it is recommended that you start with a ratio of  rounded tablespoon   grams of coffee grounds per  to ml of water you can gradually add  grams of coffee as you go until you have reached your sweet spot another interesting tip for darker roasts you can add a pinch of salt to your coffee grounds before brewing to get a strong taste without bitterness   spice it up next time you make a cup of filter coffee try this once you’ve added your coffee grounds into your machine sprinkle a generous amount of cinnamon along with it and brew as per usual it’s the quickest and simplest way to add a little extra flavour to your cup of coffee you can also top your coffee up with grated chocolate and a few pinches of vanilla     clean machine after every brew coffee oils collect in the machine these oils need to be properly cleaned out as they will distort the flavour of the coffee you are making and give off a burnt taste not to mention not cleaning your device regularly is unhygienic             the perfect cup of coffee takes practice and diligence but it’s totally worth it  “coffee is really honest whatever you put into it you will get out” – nat fried   – the aquila d’oro research  development team  feb  butlers point of sale

change in the industry marking november has a month of promotions and low prices across product categories industry experts say this will allow small and medium businesses to capitalize on widespread consumer spend whilst preparing for the festive season from a logistics standpoint this will be easier for retailers to manage and will also reduce overwhelming foot traffic in physical stores and prevent website crashes   carefree checkout   consumers are looking for convenient checkout solutions this means online stores must have one checkout page and make use of predictive entry tools to reduce the amount of time spent entering information whilst placing orders interestingly studies show that  of online consumers are reluctant to proceed with orders if they are obligated to create an account on site or provide too much information   selfie spend   what an exciting time to be alive bmo have partnered with mastercard to deliver an innovative out of the box payment solution using

longer client retention great leadership is one of the most important building blocks of a strong clientsupplier relationship and has a direct link to an organizations bottom line  current clients are always the bread and butter of any organization and those relationships need to amplified and nurtured in order for the organization to exist  the harvard business review illustrated the importance of customer retention by stating that a  increase in client retention will increase organizations profitability by  to  important leadership traits to create longterm customer retention the business leader needs to have a strong connection with the brand to start with and aim for service excellence and consistency at all levels to create a trust relationship customers can rely on and keep coming back for  leaders who are hard on themselves create the perception of perfection that clients admire management and leadership must understand the notion that happy staff members create a ripple effect and create happier more loyal customers  distributors  research conducted by zenger folkman noticed in their findings the impact management has on employee work performance and in turn the company’s ultimate profitability  they found that great leaders created strong employees who engage more with clients and communicate value in a tangible way which lead to high client and distributor retention writer bill hogg stated that a disconnect between employees and leadership will create a negative customer experience and stunt customer and distributor retention weak leadership discourages employees from their best work it decreases crossfunctional communication and negativity affects the service quality which all damage new or existing client relationships a study first conducted in  still rings true stating that employee fatigue is a result of poor leadership support and can harm employeecustomer relationships when employees are energized they perform better and pay closer attention to the client creating an experience rather than a transaction leadership must put their heart into their client relations customers will do business where they sense sincerity and transparency  if clients are able to see your company’s values and belief by the way you act and treat them you will cement a relationship talk is cheap  leaders who are able to provide a constant stream of information and status updates to their clients build the peace of mind needed to form a long lasting relationship motivational and inspirational leadership leads to customer  distributor retention because employees are driven by positivity and therefore pour their heart and soul into their functions and pass on that good energy to everyone they interact with studies show that an unhappy customer will tell  to  of their friends if they dealt with someone who was impolite or rude to them  adding social media to the mix most people have about  facebook friends who will all read a post about poor service  research also shows that negative experiences create a clearer memory and last longer in the customer’s mind and this negative belief driving negative behaviours leadership impacts client retention by setting a clear path for their employees  by providing your employee with a broader sense of your organization and the community you serve it will change their perspective on how they should engage with clients  loyalty is created when employees are fully aware of their clients  distributors wants and needs and set expectations and capabilities early on in the conversation great leaders create client retention by creating collaborative groups where customer service involves a number of people who are all as helpful and as friendly as the next this projects a desired image of your company and shows the client that their one positive experience wasn’t an isolated incident but the way in which your company operates on an ongoing basis  another factor to consider and why customer service should be a group effort is that  of consumers are concerned when their account is taken over by another unfamiliar individual and causes strain on the relationship great leaders create memorable experiences and create excitement around their brands which encourages clients to become “unpaid brand ambassadors”  this includes being able to sort out problems quickly and with ease and surpassing a client’s expectations by using good judgement   as research has stated leadership in an organization sets the tone and the pace for the organization the way leaders treat and manage their employees have a direct influence on how employees engage with their clients and how the customer views the organizations value proposition   best regards the

as a lighthouse for any organization and without them your organization is dead in the water and your clients will set sail with another ship  sop’s may be painstaking sometimes even dubbed as being pointless but there is a strong correlation to following this plan and retaining clients  distributors  there is a reason that sops are embodied in the th principle of good clinical practice gcp because they are significant to a company’s longevity studies from the us small business administration chamber of commerce found that the cost of new business development is  to  times more expensive than customer relationship management  the longterm profitability of client retention highlights the need for strong standard operating procedures to strengthen established client relationships save

south african chocolate retail industry the south african chocolate retail industry as a result of international inclinations seems to be bulletproof although the industry is currently dominated by the larger role players what impact does the individual’s search for a unique chocolate experience mean for the industry “chocolate is one of those products that is recession proof the market is still growing at around  per year” these are the words of cathal queally brand manager of the south african based company chocolate direct industrysurvey  given the current global financial climate one does not seem to find this kind of reaction in many retail industries worldwide however on closer inspection it seems that queally’s description on the chocolate retail industry to be “recession proof” is more than reliable the constant growth in retail figures owes thanks to a few key aspects the first of which is the increasing awareness of chocolate’s health benefits franchisehelp    health benefits research over the past decade has proven that the presence of antioxidants found in darker chocolate chocolate containing more than  cocoa could prevent or delay the development of cardiac medical diseases the famous medical doctor and television personality dr oz argues that “dark chocolate keeps one looking and feeling younger as it helps control blood pressure avoids wrinkles and keeps one’s skin younger and slimmer” this medical breakthrough has caused increased sales of dark chocolate which in turn has led to an increase in the demand to cacao franchisehelp  cocoa demand according to the article published by franchise help chocolate industry analysis  – cost  trends the increased demand to cacao seems to be met with poor supply  the reasons therefor are threefold firstly  of total cocoa production originates from west african countries due to the politically unstable nature of these countries resulting in sporadic outbreaks of war the international supply of cocoa seems to be subdued at times although the expansion of supply to different parts of the world seems imminent the international cocoa organisation explains that it takes up to five years for a new cocoa plant to yield its first crop this results in expansion of supply being a timely process franchisehelp  secondly the supply of cocoa is under a great deal of stress due to global warming the international centre for tropical agriculture has issued a warning that at the current rate of temperature increase west african countries may experience an increase of average temperature of degree celsius by  as argued in the article future of the chocolate industry looks sticky barnato and graham explains that the temperature in west african countries by  might be too high for cocoa crops to grow as trees could struggle to obtain enough water barnato and graham  finally barnato and graham argue that due to the high level of child labour utilised within the harvesting of cocoa crops delays are experienced in the supply of cocoa due to protest action based upon the ethical matter surrounding child labour there are reportedly more than  million children working in the cocoa harvesting industry   of which under “exploitative conditions” barnato and graham  these reasons have led to global cocoa production decreasing from  million tonnes in  to  million tonnes in  franchisehelp  barnato and graham  this inevitably resulted in an increase in cocoa price and subsequently the price of chocolate to the end user according to franchise help consumers do not mind the increase in the price of chocolate as it is seen as an “affordable luxury” franchisehelp  indirectly concurring on queally’s views as set out above industry growth the global chocolate retail industry grew by  between  and  hitting the  billion mark barbato and graham  with the usa occupying the largest portion at  billion franchisehelp  the reasons therefor are twofold firstly over the past decade asian pacific countries have shown a growing interest in chocolate franchisehelp  as these countries get increasingly more accustomed to “western tastes” their demand for chocolate has grown to such an extent that the impact thereof on global sales may increase with approximately  by  franchisehelp  secondly one has to consider the emergence of niche chocolatier chocolate stores who create unique and individualised products franchisehelp  alternatively known as retail chocolate stores these are defined as stores that retail exclusive chocolates to consumers who focus on premium and seasonal sweets watt  in her article chocolate retailers to grow through  watt argues that although the majority of chocolate sales emerge from the grocery store sphere  exclusive chocolate stores are experiencing growth due to the rise in individuals’ disposable income combined with their high demand for premium chocolate  according to watt the international chocolate sensation lindt showed to most growth under these circumstances  south african context parallel to the international market the south african chocolate retail industry valued at r billion is highly secure with cadbury nestlé and beacon controlling  of total sales insightsurvey  considering that  thereof emerge from chocolate slabs the leading south african brands are currently cadbury’s dairy milk lunch bar ps and chomp as well as nestlé’s bar one and kitkat insightsurvey  according to the international snack manufacturer mondelēz south africa will be responsible for  of the global chocolate growth by  insightsurvey  although these role players are currently occupying the local market since  south africa saw a growing amount of private chocolatiers creating unique dark vegan spicy and fruity speciality chocolates according to the sa chocolate industry landscape report as published by insight survey it becomes apparent that niche chocolatiers are eroding the market share of big role players  kees beyers argues in the report that this is due to the eradication of import duty on raw materials combined with the consumer’s association of small speciality chocolates with quality good service and attention to detail inightsurvey  conclusion the south african chocolate retail industry currently parallels the international horizon although there exist intercontinental factors that may cause an increase in the price of chocolate to the end user the nature of the industry seems to accept this fate better than others through the course of this article it had become apparent that the consumer is constantly searching for a unique chocolate experience even though this might have detrimental effects on the larger role players within the industry it currently ensures a brighter future for the individual chocolatiers aquila d’oro coffee roastery top baristas spill the beans in a world gone coffee crazy we are all in search of that perfect cup of coffee but there’s no shame in having untrained pallet sometimes we need a little help from the experts themselves in true eat pray love fashion our group marketing division went in search of answers how we too could recreate perfect cups of coffee to satisfy our growing coffee need here’s what we discovered rule the roast the freshness of the beans you use has a major impact on the taste you’ll enjoy shawn steiman of coffea consulting says beans are at their best three weeks after roasting coffee lovers need to pay close attention to “roasted on” dates and support smaller artisan roasters that only roast to order in search of freshness it is better to buy from roasters who roast to order or roast in small volumes in supermarkets coffee can stand on the shelf for weeks or months compromising the freshness of the coffee consumers should never assume coffee is fresh just because it comes from a retail outlet quick tip fans of darker roasts should split large orders as darker roasts oxidize quicker   pure water anson goodge head trainer at ozone coffee roasters in london believes that using filtered water or even bottled water opposed to conventional tap water influences the quality of the coffee significantly filtered water removes sediment and chlorine from water and also reduces the total hardness th of the water which influences cup quality and bean extraction using conventional tap water you also run the risk of limescale build up which is harmful to your health and can also damage your machine expert coffee roasters jazmin  christian medrano of brew brew in chicago suggest heating filtered water between  °c to  °c for the perfect brew this temperature allows for better diffusion during the percolating process and enhances the coffee flavour more effectively than cooler water beware of using water that exceeds  °c as this will bring out bitterness in the bean which you don’t want     refrigeration myth contrary to what you may have heard keeping your coffee grounds in the fridge or deep freeze is probably the worst thing you can do keeping coffee in a cold moist environment speeds up the aging process and draws in unfavourable smells into your coffee coffee should be kept in a cold dry temperaturestable environment away from direct sunlight in an opaque container preferably todd goldsworthy us brewers cup champion says it’s important to keep your coffee airtight to prevent oxidation that will compromise bean quality quick tip expert coffee roasters jazmin  christian medrano store their beans in a “dark coloured ceramic or glass container” for ultimate freshness   good grind it’s important to only grind the beans you will be using right away as pregrinding leads to flavourless coffee when used at a later stage katie cargiuilo winner of the  us championship urges coffee lovers to buy whole beans and swears that barista enthusiasts need to grind their own beans if they want to create and recreate perfect cups of coffee choose the correct grinder – stay away from blade grinders that burn grains and leave inconsistent grounds as this influences the extraction process of the bean when brewed quick tip for a stronger coffee taste don’t add more coffee rather grind the beans finer to increase the surface area of the bean to release more flavour   nice device many people don’t know that different blends should be brewed in different ways to bring out the best flavour of the bean mocha java and blue mountain for example because of their fruity undertones using a pour over machine with a metal filter is the most appropriate method for brewing smooth wellbalanced blends are best suited for a bean to cup or espresso machine blends with a sweet undertone are a perfect match for a plunger expert pick katie cargiuilo winner of the  us championship swears by ceramic drippers for a homebrew single cup soloution she mentioned that in her experience plastic drippers “underextract your coffee as it cools down” because plastic drippers are unable to effectively trap heat whilst brewing quick tip when using a drip machine use metal filters these filters allow small coffee particles and oils into your cup of coffee whilst percolating and create a fuller body coffee for more distinct flavours make use of paper filters that prevent the filtration of those coffee particles and oils brown paper filters are not recommended as they tend to give coffee an undesirable taste practice proportions nat fried one of canadas top baristas says consistency is one of the most important elements in creating a great cup of coffee you have to practice your proportions learn the correct coffee to water ratio and length of brew to recreate the perfect cup of coffee don’t over scoop use accurate measuring tools such as a scale with a decimal point to ensure you are using the correct amount of coffee every time quick tip for darker blends it is recommended that you start with a ratio of  rounded tablespoon   grams of coffee grounds per  to ml of water you can gradually add  grams of coffee as you go until you have reached your sweet spot another interesting tip for darker roasts you can add a pinch of salt to your coffee grounds before brewing to get a strong taste without bitterness   spice it up next time you make a cup of filter coffee try this once you’ve added your coffee grounds into your machine sprinkle a generous amount of cinnamon along with it and brew as per usual it’s the quickest and simplest way to add a little extra flavour to your cup of coffee you can also top your coffee up with grated chocolate and a few pinches of vanilla     clean machine after every brew coffee oils collect in the machine these oils need to be properly cleaned out as they will distort the flavour of the coffee you are making and give off a burnt taste not to mention not cleaning your device regularly is unhygienic             the perfect cup of coffee takes practice and diligence but it’s totally worth it  “coffee is really honest whatever you put into it you will get out” – nat fried   – the aquila d’oro research  development team butlers point of sale logistics change in consumer demand shapes online shopping  online

heeltemal jou geloof omdat dit alles net te groot is of jy val op jou knieë neer en aanbid hierdie asemrowende alomteenwoordige soewereine god en vader ek dink besigheidsmense kan soms sukkel om in te koop in die evangelie omdat hulle met baie tasbare en sigbare dinge besig is  “seeing is believing”  is baiekeer die motto thomas een van jesus se dissipels het ook die probleem gehad  hy was aanvanklik nie by gewees toe jesus aan sy dissipels verskyn het nie  toe die dissipels vir hom sê dat jesus aan hulle verskyn het wou hy hulle nie glo nie  in johannes  vers b sê thomas die volgende  “as ek nie die merke van die spykers in sy hande sien en my vinger in die merke van die spykers steek en my hand in sy sy steek nie sal ek nooit glo nie” ag dae later verskyn jesus weer aan die dissipels en hy sê toe vir thomas in vers   “bring jou vinger hier en kyk na my hande en bring jou hand  en steek hom in my sy en moenie langer ongelowig wees nie maar wees gelowig” nou ons almal is baiekeer so dat ons eers wil sien en dan wil glo – want dit is net baie makliker natuurlik  maar geloof werk nie so nie in vers  sê thomas  “my here en my god” vers   sê jesus vir thomas  “glo jy nou omdat jy my sien  gelukkig is die wat nie gesien het nie en tog glo” geloof so sê die hebreërskrywer vir ons in hebr  is  “om te glo is om seker te wees van die dinge wat ons hoop om oortuig te wees van die dinge wat ons nie sien nie”  ek was vanoggend so h by news cafe in bloubergstrand  die mis was geweldig dik soveel so dat ek die see en tafelberg glad nie kon sien nie – maar ek het geweet dat die see en die berg daar is alhoewel ek dit nie kon sien nie baiekeer ook in besigheid is dit asof daar ‘n misbank oor ons sak as gevolg van omstandighede dit gaan nie goed met besigheid nie die geld kom nie in nie en ewe skielik wonder ons of god daar is want ons ervaar dat hy afwesig is  weet verseker hy is daar  die misbank van omstandighede het hom vir jou vir ‘n wyle kom wegsteek mag julle hierdie week goeie besigheid doen – al gaan dit partykeer sleg weet hy is daar al sien julle hom momenteel nie  die besigheidsmense met wie ek te doen kry is mense met geloof – want hulle moet meeste van die tyd besluite in geloof neem en glo dat hulle besluite gaan uitwerk  bly glo en bid en vertel vir andere van julle geloof en wat hy vir julle in besigheid beteken can it be that there is a reluctance amongst some business people to buy into the gospel  i have been in the ministry for  years and during this time i came across many people whom most of them are in business of some sort like all of us these incredible people with a calling in difficult and challenging circomstances are all struggling with really deep and honest questions about god   it is in these environments that i have learned a lot about faith and about god most of the transactions that takes place within this hostile environment our economic playing field  is done in faith for the business person must believe in the product or the person with whom he does business with this same principle is valid in the gospel where you have to believe in the person named jesus christ  the product of this belief are then usually god ‘s children however many people have problems and reservations with this product and start questioning the gospel  people only buy into the gospel when they start believing but in the process of buying in lies a challenge i think the biggest challenge comes whether you believe there is a god or not some of us do acknowledge on a more intellectual level that there is a god the question is   do we really believe in this truth  in louis giglio ‘s book  ” indescribable ” henry schaefer  graham perdue professor of chemistry and director of the center for computational quantum chemistry at the university of georgia  makes the following remark “the significance and joy in my science comes in those occasional moments of discovering something new and saying to myself… so that ‘s how god did it” most of us that believe in the existence of a god struggle with taking the next step towards believing in the triune god god the father  god the son and god the holy spirit  it has been in this particular instance that many intellectual people struggle and loose the plot  they say ” it is impossible  it is already difficult to believe in a god and even more so when it is a triune god  ” at this point in time i would like to take the opportunity and refer you to the book of john john  here jesus is explicit in his direction and gives the following interesting answer  ” i assure you before abraham was born  i am all that i am ” with these words   he confirms that he and the father are one  i always go back to the creation and look from the macro – cosmos to the micro – cosmos  it helps me a lot for when i compare myself to the macro cosmos  which include all the stars and planets and the milky way  it never seems to stop amazing me how incredible small i am against all that he created  how will i ever be able to understand this great  mindblowing  magnificent god  do not be discourage for next time our conversation continues  riaan an introduction to ds riaan esterhuyse – spiritual consultant – agl group over the past three years agl group ceo johan slabbert has worked closely with riaan esterhuyse involved with leadership development of previously disadvantaged school learners and the development of the spiritual side of businesses including the agl group of organisations the agl group executive is passionate about finding practical ways to meet business objectives and make decisions in alignment with their spiritual beliefs but before we delve in to this discussion and the positive impact this spiritual leadership has had on the company as a whole we’d like to formally introduce riaan and tell you a bit more about him riaan was born in mafikeng but spent most of his childhood in uitenhage in the eastern cape with a wellrespected pastor as a father and a dedicated social worker as a mother becoming a pastor would seem like a natural choice however riaan had no intention of becoming a pastor in his early years and even has a distinct memory of a day in grade  when he promised god that only if he got over  he would be a pastor some day that promise stayed with him but when he matriculated in  he didn’t feel quite ready for this calling and joined the south african defence force instead after a year in oudtshoorn and a year on the border he finally enrolled in ministry and spent the next four years completing his first degree riaan went on to do a masters degree in clinical pastoral education before joining the dutch reform church in milnerton in  where he spent eight happy years as the second pastor he first met johan in  while raising money for a sound system for the church johan said “riaan i’ll give you the first r  for the sound system let’s challenge the other business leaders to meet this or better it” that was the start of their relationship which over the years developed into a sound friendship riaan says “we clicked from the beginning i soon realised that johan is a mover and shaker ready to turn the world upside down a dynamic person with a good heart with an absolute passion for people” about three years ago johan decided he wanted to base his entire business on his christian values by putting god first in other words he saw his companies as god’s companies and he is working for god as the ceo of the group since then he has been meeting with riaan regularly to discuss the challenges of how to uphold a christian value system in todays business world riaan has similar dialogues with about  other professional executives in the cape town area offering them guidance and discussing the key questions around how businessmen can function as christians within our modern corporate world galatians  describes nine attributes that riaan uses to explain how you should behave in business as a christian patience good heartedness faithfulness peace friendliness joy love selfcontrol and humbleness he goes on to say “ask yourself how your people see you if you are showing those attributes they will be drawn to you as you reflect the image of god” which is taken from genesis  so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them  riaan comments that this is not always easy “you have to work at being a true leader for your people how to make tough decisions and to deal with other businesses that may ethically be in the wrong in how they conduct themselves in their day to day actions as christian leadership you need to learn to stand back give love and avoid retaliation” he often uses stories from the book of daniel to explain how to approach difficult situations resulting in the question are you bowing before the pressures of the world’s gods or are you prepared to be steadfast in your faith and only bow before god and take the consequences of that even if you’re thrown in to the oven of this world another theme of many of the conversations between johan and riaan is how to serve this living god of ours on an every day level riaan explains that his starting point in conversation is often to ask businessmen to decide if they believe in god if the answer is yes they need to decide if they are prepared to do what god and the holy spirit are asking from them or listening to the direction given to them faith is like breathing it is continuous and if you say you love god then you must be prepared to be obedient and love him all the way riaan explains that sometimes this means you will have to make tough business decisions and decide what is against your christian value system grounding this conversation in our political environment riaan believes that “in south africa we need christian business leadership who are bold about who and what they believe in and not ashamed or scared to confess that they believe in the triune god god the father god the son and god the holy spirit all their actions and decisions must be based and directed by their absolute conviction within the will of god”  he believes that this drive and conviction amongst our business leaders will have dramatic positive affects on the general wellbeing of our country as a whole “i also know that the fight for the spiritual survival of our country is on a business level these market place ministers as i like to call them are actually pioneers within the spiritual fight” as a christian in a business world you can begin to move towards being a mature child of god by using prayer dwelling in the word – read to understand it and hear god’s voice fasting meditating and memorising the word once you are christ centred you will ask god for guidance in every important decision so let god be in front of you rather than next to you so he can guide you and show you the pitfalls for those interested in learning more about how to achieve spiritual growth riaan highly recommends a book called move what  churches reveal about spiritual growth in a nutshell there are four types of people in any organization those exploring christ growing in christ close to christ and finally christ centred stay tuned for more insight from riaan over the coming weeks     agl group of companies the gyroscope business model
