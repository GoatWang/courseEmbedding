a passport however you must have documents preferably a us passport or birth certificate with picture id such as a driving license to return to the usa foreign residents of the usa will need their green cards and passport from their country of origin note that passports or passport cards are required of all persons entering the us both citizens and noncitizens starting in june  foreign ownership oasis park resort offers the foreign investor one of the most secure forms of property ownership in all of mexico the following information describes the process of mexican property ownership we offer you the options of how foreigners can own real estate in mexico what are the ownership alternatives it is a common misconception that foreigners cannot own real estate in mexico but the reality is that they can however there are restrictive zones as described below and we have to consider the following alternatives outside the restricted zone a foreigner or foreign corporation can acquire any type of real estate as any mexican national holding the property as a direct owner complying with mexican law within the restricted zone a foreigner or foreign corporation may obtain all the rights of ownership but it must be in a bank trust known as fideicomiso another alternative is to purchase nonresidential property through a mexican corporation which can be under certain conditions  foreignowned with a provision in its bylaws that the foreigners accept to be subject to mexican laws and agree not to invoke the laws of their own country also that the real estate acquired be registered with the foreign affairs ministry and is used for nonresidential activities in other words under said conditions foreigners can acquire directly properties destined for tourist commercial and industrial use what is the restricted zone the mexican constitution regulates the ownership of the land and establishes that “…in a zone of  kilometers along the border or  kilometers along the coast a foreigner cannot acquire the direct ownership of the land” these areas are known as the “restricted or prohibited zones” nevertheless the latest mexican foreign investment law which became law on december   makes the allowances mentioned above what is the fideicomiso or bank trust any foreigner or mexican national can constitute a fideicomiso the equivalent to an american beneficial trust through a mexican bank in order to purchase real estate anywhere in mexico including the restricted zone to do so the buyer requests a mexican bank of hisher choice to act as a trustee on hisher behalfthe bank as a matter of normal course obtains the permit from the ministry of foreign affairs to acquire the chosen property in trust the fideicomiso can be established for a maximum term of  years and can be continually renewed every  years during these periods you have the right to transfer the title to any other party including a member of your family the bank becomes the legal owner of the property for the exclusive use of the buyerbeneficiary who has all the benefits of a direct owner including the possibility of leasing or transferring hisher rights to the property to a third party or to a preappointed heir during this period the foreigner is considered as a mexican national the trustee is responsible to the buyer beneficiary to ensure precise fulfillment of the trust according to mexican law assuming full technical legal and administrative supervision in order to protect the interests of the buyerbeneficiary fideicomisos are not held be the trustee as an asset of the bank for practical purposes even in unrestricted zones many foreigners and mexican nationals for that matter prefer to hold their property under a fideicomiso what is the process most real estate transactions are “opened” after a written purchase offer is accepted by the seller and when a purchasesale agreement promissory contract is signed by both parties in most cases a deposit is required by the broker in order to transmit the offer to the seller if the transaction is being conducted directly with the seller it is highly recommended that a real estate broker or a lawyer be consulted before signing any papers or handing over any money however this is the benefit of purchasing your property from international land alliance you know your seller we are a us corporation that provides us title insurance we will walk you through the entire transaction doing so will help you make sure that you do not run into any problems during the purchase process alsoin some areas it is common practice to deliver to the seller as an advance payment the equivalent to a  including the initial deposit of the total price upon signing the purchasesale agreement which should contain a penalty clause applicable in case there is a breach of contract by any of the parties normally when signing the escritura or official deed which needs to be certified by a notario publico or notary public the balance is paid and the property is delivered but with international land alliance’s developer financing program we can offer low down payments and no qualifying payment plans property ownership is in reach for most everyone what is notario publico or notary public the notario publico is a government appointed lawyer who processes and certifies all real estate
