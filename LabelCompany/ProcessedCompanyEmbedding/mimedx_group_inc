study video collagen is the material that binds cells together holds organs in place gives tissues their mechanical properties connects muscles to bone tendons and holds joints together ligaments it is the framework of the body upon which tissues are built tendons and ligaments are composed predominantly of collagen the collafix™ technology was developed to mimic the natural composition structure and mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues in order to augment their repair our materials are designed to function as a temporary mechanical support to allow early rehabilitation after surgical repair which is crucial for optimal repair of tendons and ligaments it acts as a scaffold for the emerging repair cells to generate a new tissue collafix™ is also biodegradable and disappears during the repair process and after the repair is complete the core of the collafix™ technology is based on collagen fibers that are the size of a human hair and are fabricated in continuous lengths of spooled collagen fibers these fibers are crosslinked with a crosslinking agent that not only makes them incredibly strong but also makes them biocompatible functionally longlived after implantation and resorbable with the added advantage that products resulting from the natural degradation process are also biocompatible the strength of the collafix™ fibers allows the use of standard textile manufacturing equipment to construct collafix™ devices this means that the fibers can be assembled into a variety of configurations and geometries which can be designed to mimic the natural collagen architecture in tissues another advantage of the fiber technology is that it is entirely scalable with respect to size and strength so the properties can be adapted to target the specific properties of the tissue being repaired the collafix™ fibers mimic the mechanical properties particularly strength and stiffness of natural tendon fibers  when assembled into braids the fiber system provides a scaffold for regenerative cells to invade and colonize  mechanical loads then induce the reparative cells to regenerate normal tendon tissue  the braids are as strong as human tendons and thereby allow the repaired tendon to be loaded by exercise immediately after surgery  these loads stimulate the reparative cells to differentiate into tendon cells and to regenerate normal tendon tissue instead of scar and a weak repair this technology is not yet available for sale   scientific publication qiu y lei j koob tj temenoff js cyclic tension promotes fibroblastic differentiation of human

study video collagen is the material that binds cells together holds organs in place gives tissues their mechanical properties connects muscles to bone tendons and holds joints together ligaments it is the framework of the body upon which tissues are built tendons and ligaments are composed predominantly of collagen the collafix™ technology was developed to mimic the natural composition structure and mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues in order to augment their repair our materials are designed to function as a temporary mechanical support to allow early rehabilitation after surgical repair which is crucial for optimal repair of tendons and ligaments it acts as a scaffold for the emerging repair cells to generate a new tissue collafix™ is also biodegradable and disappears during the repair process and after the repair is complete the core of the collafix™ technology is based on collagen fibers that are the size of a human hair and are fabricated in continuous lengths of spooled collagen fibers these fibers are crosslinked with a crosslinking agent that not only makes them incredibly strong but also makes them biocompatible functionally longlived after implantation and resorbable with the added advantage that products resulting from the natural degradation process are also biocompatible the strength of the collafix™ fibers allows the use of standard textile manufacturing equipment to construct collafix™ devices this means that the fibers can be assembled into a variety of configurations and geometries which can be designed to mimic the natural collagen architecture in tissues another advantage of the fiber technology is that it is entirely scalable with respect to size and strength so the properties can be adapted to target the specific properties of the tissue being repaired the collafix™ fibers mimic the mechanical properties particularly strength and stiffness of natural tendon fibers  when assembled into braids the fiber system provides a scaffold for regenerative cells to invade and colonize  mechanical loads then induce the reparative cells to regenerate normal tendon tissue  the braids are as strong as human tendons and thereby allow the repaired tendon to be loaded by exercise immediately after surgery  these loads stimulate the reparative cells to differentiate into tendon cells and to regenerate normal tendon tissue instead of scar and a weak repair this technology is not yet available for sale   scientific publication qiu y lei j koob tj temenoff js cyclic tension promotes fibroblastic differentiation of human

wounds physicians encounter a variety of wound types on a daily basis including acute wounds caused by surgical intervention trauma and burns as well as chronic wounds that are delayed in closing compared to healing in an otherwise healthy individual chronic wounds include diabetic foot ulcers venous leg ulcers pressure ulcers and arterial ulcers  the physician’s goal when treating traumatic wounds is to heal the wound while allowing the patient to retain natural function in the area of the wound with minimal scarring and infection if a wound becomes infected it can lead to a loss of limb or life and physicians want to close the wound as quickly as possible to minimize this risk patients with chronic wounds likely have comorbidities that complicate or delay the healing cascade   the healing cascade is as followsinjury inflammation proliferation and remodeling       normal soft tissue injuries heal in three main phases         chronic injuries stall in the inflammatory phase                      sports medicine sports medicine is a broad description of the repair and reconstruction of various softtissue injuries in or around joints caused by traumas or chronic conditions brought about by repeated motion in active individuals and athletes sports medicine may include various anatomical locations mainly knee shoulder and elbow but this can be broadened to include foot and ankle injuries such as achilles tendon rupture and even hand and wrist injuries the main types of injuries include tendinopathies tendinitis tendinosis tendon and ligament sprains and ruptures

for growthdec   about mimedx group mdxg robert lowy analyst healthcare biotech longshort equitysummarybiomaterials company currently undervalued by new products growth of sports spine and orthopedics sso segment and the resolution of fda and patent rulings will be the catalystsfundamentally strong company with history of consistent and strong revenue and earnings growthnote this analysis was originally prepared september   company mimedx group inc nasdaqmdxg target price  recommendation i recommend buying a long position in mimedx group inc trading at  per share at the time this analysis was conducted as i believe the market is undervaluing this security by  it is my belief that the current price reflects markets reaction to decreased revenue projections beginning in mid and a q  eps miss of  following issues with a new inventory system and slowerthanexpected production ramp up of its recently acquired subsidiary stability biologics llc it is my assessment that these represent shortterm supply chain disruptions in the face of an increasing product demand additionally the price is being depressed in the face of a q earnings beat due to downwardly revised expectations for  to reflect the aforementioned issues the catalysts for the appreciation of per share value to an estimated target of  per share over the short to intermediate term include the following growth of the spine sports medicine and orthopedics segment and continued focus on sales force growth planned release of the amniofill product line later this month as well as the future release of the collafix product line already under development resolution of currently pending patentprotection litigation expected to be ruled entirely or at least largely in favor of mimedx the risks involved with this investment in addition to overall market sentiment and volatility include the following fda judgments and requirements currently two of the companys micronized products epifix powder and the amniofix injectable are being reviewed by the fda to determine continuing status as a section  not requiring significant clinical trials and approvals or to require mimedx to obtain a biologics license application bla approval to market these products additionally the regulatory status of its future collafix product line is uncertain as to whether it will require premarket approval or obtain a waiver under section nysek legal proceedings mimedx is currently involved in a litigation against competitors for the purposes of patent protection relating to its core tissue processing and clinical products to date proceedings have appeared to favor mimedx however the final outcome and its effect on product lines revenue and share price remain uncertain product line risks the company may fail to bring new products to market in a timely fashion or at all namely its collafix product line which is susceptible to both fda regulatory requirements and approval as well as the albeit unlikely event of the termination of its current licensing agreement for this product with shriners hospitals  university of south florida reimbursement and the affordable care act aca in   of all sales were to government accounts while this trend is expected to continue or increase changes to the reimbursement structures within the aca or modifications to the law itself would affect company revenues additionally while private insurance reimbursement agreements for the companys products have grown over recent years a decrease or failure to obtain additional coverage for its current or future products by private insurers could result in diminished market penetration and revenue company overview mimedx is a us based integrated developer producer and marketer of implantable tissue products developed from human placental and umbilical cord tissues as well as amniotic fluid to the domestic market its products focus on wound care and spine sports medicine and orthopedics fy  revenue was  million with wound care contributing roughly  million  and sso contributing  million  to earnings annual revenue growth last year was  and basic eps increased from  in  to  in  these trends in earnings growth are expected to continue although slow to more sustainable rates of change with time as the company progresses from the early growth stage at the current price of  its stock currently trades at roughly x pe the company has grown via acquisition of surgical biologics llc in  and most recently the purchase of stability biologics llc in january  the purchase of stability was accomplished for a  million valuation with  million in cash  million in company stock as well as the assumption of  in debt mimedx group inc core product lines wound care epifix epifix micronized powder amniofix amniofix micronized injectable amniofill spine sports medicine and orthopedics orthoflo physio stability biologics product collafix  future planned product principal competitors organogenesis inc a private company with limited available information about revenues growth or profitability its key competing product lines are dermagraft and apligraf regarding comparability of these products to the epifix and amniofix products from mimedx a recent study showed statistically significant enhanced healing rates  epifix vs  apligraf at six weeks post procedure as well as greater cost savings in the use of epifix per graft due to the offering of different sized grafts which better approximate the surface area of the wound osiris therapeutics osir a public company with a market capitalization of  million and currently trading at a price of  per share its revenues in   statements not yet available were  million across three product lines grafix cartiform and bio compared to  million in sales for mimedx in the comparable year its principal competitive product to epifix is named grafix of note the company is under current investigation by the sec and facing a class action lawsuit for allegedly providing false information on the status of product development to shareholders additionally mimedx filed a lawsuit against osiris in may  for allegedly falsifying clinical data comparing its grafix product to epifix smith  nephew snn a large public company with a diversified corporate structure with a market capitalization of  billion currently trading at  per share its principal competitive product to epifix is oasis smith  nephew reported operating profit for wound care products of  million in   data not yet available compared to  million operating profit for mimedx in the comparable year investment thesis as of the writing of this analysis the market has priced mimedx group inc at  it is my opinion that this represents an overly bearish view of the company based on a downward revision of earnings in mid as well as a recent earnings miss in q  of  per share taken in the context of broader market uncertainty additional factors that i believe the market has priced into this valuation are the risk to market share associated with ongoing patent protection litigation as well as the potential for the fda to rule that mimedx must complete the timeconsuming and costly process of obtaining approval of a biologics license application for its micronized epifix powder and amniofix injectable products i believe that this valuation is flawed for the following reasons the revenue revision and earnings miss were caused by what are very likely transient and shortterm events the implementation of a new sales management system which caused a logistical error resulting in the miscounting of inventory and thus sales for a period of time which has subsequently been corrected additionally all sales staff are now required to be trained on the new system to avoid similar issues in the future while the company expects slowerthanexpected production at the newly acquired stability biologics plant to continue to be a relative drag on revenue it fully expects incremental quarterly improvement until all inefficiencies can be fully addressed and manufacturing streamlined delays in gaining approval of some of the newly acquired products by the value analysis committees at some hospitals while the process is taking longer than expected the feedback received regarding the effectiveness of the product makes approval likely in the short term fda review of the micronized product lines in september  a public hearing will be held regarding the micronized products and whether a bla is required after which the fda will make a final determination while the company is optimistic to shorten any lag in the marketing of these products should they require approval the company is proceeding with the necessary steps to garner bla approval these product lines reflect approximately  of fy revenue which would decrease the estimated value per share to approximately   decrease from estimated target price ceteris paribus while a negative ruling by the fda would certainly impact company earnings over the short term horizon the concurrent growth of the sso portion of the business as well as projected continued revenue growth of the remaining wound care segment would mitigate this effect new product lines to be introduced in a press release dated september   the company announced the nationwide release of the amniofill product line the first released by the company in the placental collagen matrix product line as an addition to its wound care offerings the collafix pipeline when released will likely provide a sizable gain to revenue in the sso portion of the company current questions surrounding the timing of this release include whether it will require premarket approval or receive a k waiver strong dedication to clinical research of products especially for new products clinical acceptance hinges on exposure either by experience using the product or reported results in peerreviewed publications while currently focused more on the wound care sector and showing superior results for healing of chronic wounds it is expected that as the company begins to focus on growing its sso activities its efforts in publishing in this area will enhance adoption of these products by physicians and enhance sales catalysts it is my belief that mimedx share price will appreciate  from current values with a conservative target price of  per share calculated via dcf analysis driving this appreciation in value are three principal catalysts expected increase in revenue from newly introduced products as well as the future release of the collafix product line already under development the release of the amniofill product line will provide additional revenue from the wound care segment increasing the company and shareholder value the introduction of collafix is expected to be a considerable part of the growth in the sso segment in the future once again it is not possible to quantify numerically but it is likely that demand for such a product in the sports medicine and orthopedic setting will likely be strong given an aging population that is remaining active increasing relative risk of injuries such as acl or rotator cuff that are likely to be candidates for use of the collafix product resolution of currently pending patentprotection litigation expected to be ruled entirely or at least largely in favor of mimedx while not easily quantifiable to revenue growth or share price the favorable resolution of this litigation will solidify mimedxs market share with these products and act to stem both future infringement and provide a competitive advantage in the area of implantable tissue products derived from placental or amniotic tissues additionally the resolution would bring an end to the uncertainty regarding the companys intellectual property potentially clearing the way for more riskaverse investors to invest growth of the spine sports medicine and orthopedics segment and continued focus on sales force growth with the acquisition of stability biologics in january  the company gained access to an established sales network in the sso areas this combined with an increased focus on growing the sales force will increase market penetration and sales the company has planned for sso to grow to match revenue produced by the wound care segment over the next five years which would be a boon to overall revenue this would be equivalent to an annualized growth rate of the sso sector of  if the wound care segment grows at the estimated rates per the dcf analysis with an overall cagr of  for revenue of that period and an estimated price using the assumptions previously outlined for the dcf of  per share valuation i have valued mimedx group inc using a dcf analysis the following assumptions were used in this calculation revenue growth rate company revenue growth was  in  and  in  given that these rates are unsustainable i used a linear regression of the last five annual revenue growth rates to estimate the rate of change at  this gave a  estimated growth rate of  and a  estimated growth rate of  for the period  i used the consensus analyst growth rate of  all expenseadjustment values were kept at a constant ratio to revenue based upon current trended levels longterm sustainable growth rate calculated estimates of longterm growth rate roerr were unrealistic at  for a more realistic rate in perpetuity i chose  to reflect average longterm gdp growth wacc the company currently has no longterm debt on the books so for the short term next five years i used a capital structure of  equity as it is conceivable that the company would add debt to enhance its overall cost of capital in the future for the longterm estimate of terminal value i used a wacc calculated on a target capital structure based on average of peer group with  debt and  equity with a cost of debt pretax of  based upon industry comparison of the current cost of debt the cost of equity was calculated via the capm using the year arithmetic mean of returns on the russell  to estimate expected market return erm riskfree rate rfr is the current yield on the year us treasury beta ß of  was obtained from google finance and found to be consistent with other sources investment risks the risks involved with this investment in addition to overall market sentiment and volatility include the following fda judgments and requirements fda could rule following scientific review that the micronized products do not qualify for regulation under section  as minimally processed hctps requiring the completion of the biologics license application process which would result in decreased revenue as well as increased expensestime for approval fda could require that the collafix product line is a level ii or iii medical device andor not grant a k waiver requiring the company to undergo the costly and timeconsuming process of obtaining a premarket approval legal proceedings the courts could rule against mimedx in one of three  ongoing patent protection cases initiated by mimedx this could potentially result in decreased market share and as a result decreased revenues additionally these legal actions could continue for longer than expected through multiple rounds of discovery and proceedings increasing legal expenses product line risks the brand may be unable to bring collafix to market as a result of failure of fda approval should it be required to undergo the pma process unexpected termination of licensing agreement with shriners hospitaluniversity of south florida reimbursement and the affordable care act in   of all sales were to government accounts while this trend is expected to continue or increase changes to the reimbursement structures within the aca or modifications to the law itself could affect company revenues private insurance reimbursement agreements for the companys products have grown over recent years with more than  private payers reimbursing for the epifix product line alone a decrease or failure to obtain coverage for its current or future products by private insurers would result in diminished or lost revenue respectively worstcase scenario it is possible that all of these estimates are wrong due to the unlikely event of fraudulent or misleading claims or representation of financial statements by the company macroeconomic factors such as recession unforeseen events and inherent error in estimating values for calculations therefore in this section i present the doomsday scenario where all of the assertions on the performance of the company are incorrect assuming a dramatically lower rate of growth in the short and long term as keeping pace with gdp growth estimated at  the stock would be valued at an estimated price of approximately  per share additionally in the case of liquidation of the company the price could be estimated by net assetsshares outstanding nondiluted which would equate to a price at current balance sheet values of  per share and a value of  when adjusted for intangible assets disclosure i amwe are long mdxg i wrote this article myself
