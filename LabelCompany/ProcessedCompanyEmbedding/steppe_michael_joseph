foxes live around the world in many diverse habitats including forsests grasslands mountains and deserts the foxes predators are wolves coyotes golden jaackals and medium and largesized felines the fox is an omnivore and their diet includes fruits berries and grasses they have also have a particulary long tails their defenses include their sharp teethmy hybridmy hybrid would be good for this habitat because there is a lot of grass and all three of my animals eat grass so the food supply is there the reason i used the body and legs as a horse is because they can run fast and they can kick really hard the foxes tail would be for protection because their tails can swing fast and veryn hard this is why i choose the animals for this hybridmy biomemy biome is the dry mid latitude climate steppe in the summer time it tends to be  degrees fahrenheit and in the winter can get down to  degrees fahrenheit there is not enough precipitation for trees to grow except by rivers there is not a lot of vegatation but a couple of the types are fringed sagebrush milk vetch sweet vernal rhubarb and tumbleweed some of the animal life is corsac fox mongolian gerbil saiga antelope northern lynx and

though joseph’s photographs are now considered “among the best ever” taken of the stones a dispute between the band and their record label saw a plain rsvp invitation card used for the cover which was later replaced by the infamous photograph of a graffiticovered toilet michael joseph was born in kimberly – the capital of south africa’s northern cape province – in  his father was heavily involved

benson and hedges christies nivea pirelli malaysian airlines schweppes and white horse he also worked in the fashion industry for hart schaffner and marks in chicago based on joseph’s extensive advertising portfolio he was chosen by the stones for the “beggar’s banquet” shoot in  the travel writer david saunders approached michael joseph to do a course book on photography  of his images
