topdown process security selection esg investing home process esg investing environmental social and governance socially responsible investing as a united nations principles for responsible investment unpri signatory fisher investments considers environmental social and governance issues in the investment and portfolio construction process further we regularly screen and tailor our investment approach for separately managed accounts depending on any particular social and environmental guideline mandated by the client esgsri screens and fi’s investment and portfolio construction process as part of the investment process we evaluate the risk esg issues may present to stock performance we evaluate esg issues on a casebycase basis and are willing to consider the potential impact of all types of esg concerns in particular we routinely evaluate a range of governance issues and off balance sheet risks as part of our security selection analysis these include consideration of a company’s auditors and whether their opinions are qualified or they have potential conflicts of interest shareholder concentration review of regulatory filings and review of news flow from a wide range of sources for potential esg concerns further our ongoing analysis of global political drivers can influence security selection tied to potential political or regulatory risks companies face surrounding esg issues in situations where we believe any esg issues present an inordinate risk to a company’s operational or financial performance or is we believe it presents undue headline risk where negative sentiment over the issue could present material headwind to performance we would typically choose not to invest in that company fisher investments also regularly accommodates a range of clientmandated or requested esgsri restrictions for their portfolio alternatively we can oversee and determine the stocks to be restricted from purchase based on our interpretation of the socially responsible goals defined by the client for clients with separate accounts in socially responsible or esg mandates the investment policy committee ipc in conjunction with the firm’s research analysts screens each security to determine whether it meets the client’s specific guidelines this may include further analysis of the nonfinancial qualities of a company such as determining if its strategic attributes and the economicpolitical drivers are in line with socially responsible guidelines andor esg principles fisher investments’ research department has access to tools such as msci esg research to help determine a company’s suitability within a socially responsible or esg portfolio however in some cases our interpretations may differ from the client’s interpretation on a securitybysecurity basis if an investment’s validity during initial implementation and beyond raised any questions additional dialogue would occur between the firm and client to help ensure compliance when a proactive ipc decision or client restriction causes the exclusion of a candidate security from purchase tied to esg issues the ipc would seek to find an appropriate replacement ot fill the intended role in the portfolio this may involve adding a new replacement security andor adding weight to existing positions in most cases the ipc is generally able to use alternate or replacement securities to replicate the desired topdown or thematic market exposure of candidate excluded for esg reasons as such we typically do not expect esg restrictions to materially impact expected risk or return characteristics of the strategy esgsri sources of information throughout the research process we use various databases and information vendors to collect macroeconomic and companyspecific data efficiently assisting with environmental social and corporate governance issues we subscribe to msci esg research as it provides specific social and environmental screening capabilities to our research department in combination with readily available public information from our ongoing analysis of holding and portfolio candidates we are generally able to accommodate socially responsible and esg clientmandated
