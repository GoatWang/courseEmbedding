ecosystembased approaches provide the underpinnings for essentially all science themes that define the usgs every point on earth falls within a specific ecosystem where data other information assets and the expertise of usgs and its many partners can be employed to quantitatively understand how that ecosystem functions and how it responds to natural and anthropogenic disturbances every benefit society obtains from the planet—food water raw materials to build infrastructure homes and automobiles fuel to heat homes and cities and many others are derived from or effect ecosystems the vision for core science systems builds on core strengths of the usgs in characterizing and understanding complex earth and biological systems through research modeling mapping and the production of high quality data on the nation’s natural resource infrastructure together these research activities provide a foundation for ecosystembased approaches through geologic mapping topographic mapping and biodiversity mapping the vision describes a framework founded on these core mapping strengths that makes it easier for usgs scientists to discover critical information share and publish results and identify potential collaborations that transcend all usgs missions the framework is designed to improve the efficiency of scientific work within usgs by establishing a means to preserve and recall data for future applications organizing existing scientific knowledge and data to facilitate new use of older information and establishing a future workflow that naturally integrates new data applications and other science products to make it easier and more efficient to conduct interdisciplinary research over time given the increasing need for integrated data and interdisciplinary approaches to solve modern problems leadership by the core science systems mission will facilitate problem solving by all usgs missions in ways not formerly possible related projects no science
