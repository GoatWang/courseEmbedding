which it has been synonymous for more than a century the lake forest illinoisheadquartered corporation announced last week brunswick bowling products which is headquartered in muskegon has been sold to bluearc capital management llc  according to brunswick chairman and ceo dustan mccoy the atlantabased bluearc is a longterm investor that plans to keep the companys bowling products headquarters in muskegon with manufacturing operations in szekesfehervar hungary and reynosa mexico the brunswick name and all that it stands for will carry on and continue to set the standard in the bowling industry mccoy said in a news release the sale comes about a year after the corporation agreed to sell its bowling center business to bowlmor amf for  million at that time the company announced its intention to divest its bowling products business which it now has completed bluearc completed the acquisition of brunswick bowling products with investments from gladstone investment corp a publicly traded business development company in mclean virginia and capitala finance corp a business development company in charlotte north carolina a sale price was not disclosed brunswick is a great fit for us michael roher managing partner of bluearcs private equity business said in a news release we focus in investing in wellestablished marketleading companies and helping them innovate and grow over time the brand the products and the management team all demonstrate the high performance attributes we seek within our portfolio companies officer of brunswick bowling products brent perrier told mlive muskegon chronicle in july  that brunswick corp derives less than  percent of its overall business from bowling and billiards while it has financial interests in a wide variety of fields including boating and recreational equipment bowling is what it has been most closely associated with for many in the general population the companys partnership with bluearc would seem to indicate that association will continue for the time being but in name only the longterm future of brunswicks muskegon bowling operation also is completely up to bluearc and its partners  the prospect of new ownership might be a bit an unsettling for some of its  employees in muskegon but perrier seems content with the transaction brunswick bowling products has been known for quality products and innovation for  years he said were excited to be associated with bluearc throughout the sale process bluearc was the obvious choice for our management team their commitment to our business is a very positive sign to the entire industry brunswick brought its bowling and billiards operations to muskegon in  the brunswick bowling products equipment manufacturing plant at seaway drive and laketon
