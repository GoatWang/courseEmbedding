disorders as an independent biotechnology company spun out of biogen’s hemophilia business we bring a strong legacy of innovation worldclass science and commitment to the rare blood disorders community we are united by a singular purpose to create progress where patients need it most we believe that great science conquers the toughest medical obstacles and we are inspired to push scientific boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with rare blood disorders beginning with hemophilia we will lead by doing what’s right for patients and those who care for them and by actively working with the blood disorders community to accelerate innovation and develop lifechanging treatments   john g cox ceo our hemophilia therapies were the first major advancements in the treatment of hemophilia a and b in nearly two decades and are the first extended halflife clotting factors introduced to patients we will continue to explore the potential benefits and better understand the science of these therapies in areas of serious need including immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors longterm joint health and women with bleeding disorders in the same spirit as in hemophilia we will carry forward a commitment to significantly impact the lives of people with other rare blood disorders including cold agglutinin disease sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia press releases watch creating progress together together we are committed to making a significant positive impact for patients and society through innovative programs that aim to improve access to treatment advance disease understanding and create true partnership with the community our commitment to that purpose is reflected in our name “bio” refers to our legacy of scientific innovation which we will build upon and “ver” refers to the latin word veritas meaning truth “ativ” is based on the word active —we will actively work with the community build trust

science forward to benefit patients our pipeline leaders in their fields our scientists are deeply committed to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients leveraging our deep understanding of the biology of hemostasis gained over  years of research we plan to accelerate the development of our innovative pipeline of programs in hemophilia cold agglutinin disease sickle cell disease beta thalassemia and other blood disorders our pipeline includes hemophilia programs that have been designed to provide lessfrequent prophylactic dosing for hemophilia a and subcutaneous dosing for hemophilia b and gene therapy programs for hemophilia a and b  it also includes programs to address cold agglutinin disease a rare and chronic autoimmune hemolytic condition for which there are no approved therapies bivv9 formerly tnt9 is the only therapy in development that is designed to selectively inhibit the classical complement pathway of the immune system bivv9 targets cs thereby impacting the central mechanism of this disease we are also pursuing several approaches that seek to target the root cause of sickle cell disease a profoundly debilitating disease that is linked to a shorter life expectancy and has few treatment options just as we have done in hemophilia we hope to bring forward new medicines that meaningfully advance the
