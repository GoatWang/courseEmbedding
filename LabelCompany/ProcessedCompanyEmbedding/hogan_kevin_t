from scratch this experience will show you the way simplify your life give you more joy and give you the pleasure of watching your new pile of gold grow each day theres all kinds of neat little blueprints to building wealth out there ive seen most of them i suppose in a perfect world some could work but when i sat down and looked at the bestselling plans to see what was missing and why so many people were disappointed it was obvious that what was needed was a real system system implies algorithm algorithm implies step by step predictability and completion some programs i checked out were grounded in silliness if you get a  return on your money per year then you heres the thingthat is not going to happen ive met perhaps a handful of people who know the truth about investing ready the stock market after taxes dividends inflation and transaction costs has returned  per year since  since   the stock market is very cyclical and predictably so its highly unlikely the markets will return the same  over the next decade whats the truth about that  number no one can promise it or guarantee it no one wealth accumulation is not about investing in stocks or bonds youll learn the truth about if and when in this coursebut now is not the time for either honest to goodness most of what is out there might be well intended but the teaching is so airy fairy that no one could actually do anything with what they learn there were a few exceptions there were some methods that simply wouldnt and couldnt work they were disturbing approaches to securing a sound future i wasnt sure which i liked less when you were born there was no life instruction manual there was also no wealth manual and to date there never has beenuntil now aside from being immensely valuable youre about to experience the most valuable system youll ever use its fun which means youll use it every single day youve heard of going from  to  in  seconds in reference to a car right have you ever heard of going from starting with  in debt only to become a millionaire someone wrote that about me and while its technically correcttheres more to the story than numbers you probably know a bit of my story here is the thumbnail in three paragraphs i was raised in chicago by a darn good mom our family moved between poor cant get any poorer and lower class depending on whether mom was married or not at the timewhether someone had just died or was dying in a hospital or yes when there were not one but two hospital beds in our tiny home life was often nothing short of emotionally brutal our neighborhood was not violent although one guy did burn down the entire high school that was attended by  people ok that was a little distressing everyone that grew up in that child packed neighborhood had choices in life they could choose to live a lower income bracket life when they got older they could choose to live a middle class life when they got older they could choose to live with an upper class income bracket when they got older it was and still is a choice i have no idea what your life experience was as a kid i hope it was fantastic our experience was unusual we were not only poor but we had the largest unforeseen debt load of anyone youve ever known it was absolutely not anyones fault or choice we didnt have any money to spend there were no credit cards my first step dad spent the better part of  years in and out of the hospital accumulating debt that exceeded one million dollars how does hospital debt get so big once you exceed a lifetime limit the insurance doesnt pay out benefits its a long story with a lot of instructive experiences that ill save for the course as you grow up it becomes pretty obvious you can choose to live in poverty your entire life make minor changes or make major changes i dont know about you but i hated being poor i wasnt afraid of it because i lived it for a decade when i was  the boy scouts brought a thanksgiving turkey and old clothes some fit some didnt all got worn better than not having any at all was indeed the correct answer it makes no difference where you begin got a job dont have debt dont it just doesnt matter where you are going is  your decision today in america  of people in the upper income bracket today were in the bottom  income brackets one decade ago you can know those kind of numbers will continue its inspiring what caused  of people to leave living in lower income brackets to living a more fulfilling and rewarding life it wont be because they got lucky it wont be because someone gave them a job it wont be because the government cut them a check it will be because they chose to change their life situation period some people want you to believe that if you were or even if you are poor today for some wild reason you are destined to remain there forever as if someone is stopping people from living their dreams that is not only untrue its a dangerous belief in the wealth creation and accumulation system e course youll be exposed to a new world there are no courses on wealth accumulation or wealth psychology offered in high school there is no playbook then when you get to collegethere are no courses offered on the psychology of wealth accumulation in the last  years weve learned more about wealth accumulation at the research level and the face to face in the real world level than we knew the previous hundred years combined and things have changed so dramatically in the last decade that the playing field doesnt even look the same if you went to college you probably went so that when you got out youd be able to get a job and one thing is for sure if you graduated from college you had a huge advantage over those who didnt graduate from college a college graduate earns about  times what a non graduate earns ultimately that dollar figure will almost always be enough to get by and will do nothing toward growing wealth to be clear about  of households in the us regardless of their income have no chance at accumulating wealth without making the changes itemized in this system paradoxically almost every one of those households has the actual ability to live a wealth life it seems ridiculous to think that someone earning  per year doesnt have a better chance at wealth as someone earning  per year its counterintuitive but they simply dont the person at  annual income is living paycheck to paycheck in about  of families the same is true surprisingly enough for households earning  per year its no wonder people get off to a terribly slow start in life its no wonder people get on a hamster wheel and stay there for decades its tragic and heartbreaking very little about having wealth is intuitive today something like  people in the usa are on food stamps i remember the one and only time we used food stamps when i was a kid i was about  years old and we went shopping my mom had three kids no husband no full time job no resources and she broke down and took money from the governmentfor two weeks she was so disgusted that we never used them again shed earn her own money and not take that which was earned by someone else she got a full time job instead thank god she made that decision or i might have been a very different person today your psychological programming needs to be changed to move beyond where you are today your money memory is a very important part of your programming just as it is mine those early experiences with money shaped your beliefs attitudes and behaviors around money most of those beliefs attitudes and behaviors are dysfunctional and need repair i know because it took a long time to unplug the vast majority of those programs which were a life disaster unfortunately one category of sabotaging money memory is enough to erase any opportunity at growing wealth id like to suggest to you that three things comprise wealth time money and love had i not had a mom who loved me again my life would have been very different once you have food water and shelter love and time become very important the idea of being wealthy never was important to me until  i certainly never wanted or even considered the notion of being rich i didnt see the point at that point you could see that the united states was going the way of japan we as a nation had been great and we were going to start a slide that  years from that point was going to be ugly political parties started buying votes with promises of free money one of my few strengths as a person was math particularly statistics and probability i ran the math in  and i got very concerned that living a normal life wouldnt be a normal life for the duration of my life it was obvious that carrying on as i was would actually go backward over time and that is precisely what happened i started researching various options and developed an approach to building wealth that relied on thinking it took several years before a track record was established got a track record heres one page of that record at the turn of the st century the economy had gotten much worse pretty much all the nations in the world were printing a lot of counterfeit money which meant that money wasnt going to be worth what it was for the previous three centuries by the mid s i had put myself in a financial position that was sensible and i began to encourage people who read my work to buy gold at the time gold was  per ounce i had begun buying gold not long before that financial advisers wrote emails to me every day telling me i was wrong but they lived in a very small world they based their thinking on a set of principles and beliefs instilled by their industry that no longer matched what was happening in the world i told thousands of them they needed to get their clients in gold four years ago on twitter i told people to get out of the stock market completely that it was going to go off a cliff it was simply obvious based on the data i use it did just that youre going to see a similar experience in the next year ill show you how to navigate your way through this mess what i gained from this course is simply beyond what i can express through wordsthe required push a lot of confidence wiping out a lot of fears from me that i could not bring forth and explain identifying a few damaging personal weaknesses i developed over the years running on the wheel reassurances on a lot of flashes of thought which i firmly believed were true  but got buried as i could not gather evidence to support those and a lot of insights that no one else would have ever shared with me and a unique feedback i can give  i am based in india a few time zones and culturally different  but what you have shared is absolutely true for us i consider this a turning point in my life thank you once again anish augustine bangalore india   meanwhile in that    period what happened was most americans went into a tailspin they lost their ability to move out of their homes because they had mortgages that were bigger than what their house was worth or what they had paid for itand they had no wealth middle class america rolled the dice that a box of wood would go up in value it made no sense people really believed that a house was an investment its not it is a store of value it will always be worth something but you cant count on it to go up in value thats just silly gold shot up from  to  some of my readers would email me saying thank you over and over and over they watched  turn into  in less than  years now  is not rich and im not saying i single handedly helped people get rich over night that just isnt right i simply showed people how to save their financial lives and secure themselves and those they love while the people who didnt take the time to learn about wealth and money started slipping off the cliff you can only save the people who listen most people were stuck in a th century model trying to make decisions in the st century the world had chanced they wanted to be right they believed in nonsense they were taught and they went down the tubes today the financial advisers are paying close attention people who followed the plan built stepping stones to wealth everyone else losta lot there is very good news however dont let anyone kid you building wealth in this decade is very different but no more difficult than it was in  or  or  you simply want to let it happen much faster than you would have  years ago and fear not there are no stocks to buy there is nothing risky that needs to be done quite the opposite this is the new paradigm of building wealth not investing if you have some cool investing plan that has been in your family for  or  years have at it it wont interfere your financial planners job is secure though you might want to teach her what you learn so she doesnt go broke along with everyone else if she follows her own advice your life is impacted by world events the economy is impacted by world events but growing wealth is a pretty basic life function that anyone can do in spite of world events at no time in history has crisis or disaster stopped individuals who understood what was going on from growing wealth and securing their future  years ago no one invested in stock markets and wealth was built through good times and bad the last  years have brought more variables to the table that have to be accounted for and incorporated into the wealth equation fortunately there is an equation think about it do you have any idea what the right answer is to these questions do you know if you should be buying a house in  do you know if you should be leaving your job for another do you know if you should buy gold or stocks or commodities or futures or anything else do you know what allows you to grow wealth like those in the upper income bracket most people dont have the answer to those questions theyll never learn the answer to those questions and there is a sad reason this is the case well talk about this in depth during the  week ecourse and there are cut and dried and answers to all of those questions the big picture is now scripted you can build wealth or you can fall off the cliff its all a choice but keep in perspective that money or what money buys is more about quality of life for the rest of your life than it is about skyscrapers and personal jets time love money you really need all three to have a life you deserve and when you do you have all three you have real wealth the answer to how do i build wealth is pretty simple but the execution requires finesse there is absolutely a small number of approaches that are right and a monstrous set that are wrong and without wealth access to time love and money you could survive but you will barely be alive wealth in one way is like an oasis it is yours and it is there to serve you when you need it and like reaching the oasis you start out in the middle of nowhere and only those who get to the oasis will drink the cool water i dont want to sound all serious about wealth it has its fun side too wealth also has some perks to it wealth isnt about the limo although i do like the limo its not about the penthouse suitebut it is sweet i rarely use the jacuzzi but i like the vip service and special treatment its not about getting paid to travel to all kinds of exotic places in the world although thats pretty cool for me personally wealth is about safety security peace of mind never having to worry about what life will be like next year  years from now  years from now  years from now  years from now its taken care of not exactly exciting stuff to think about but for me it solves a myriad of problems wealth allows some people the ability to party nonstop wealth allows some people to have hot cars and hit all the hot bars wealth allows some people to be socialites and the center of the attention heres the thing if you earn it do what you want and live how you choose today its hard to think of an argument to not make it a big life priority there are plenty of roads to wealth now you can actually take your pick about  in  of the wealthy simply inherit it thats good for them it did nothing for you and me  in  who choose to be wealthy secured themselves in predictable ways and there really are a few predictable ways people become wealthy the last  years have given us more opportunities than ever its such a paradox there have never been more ways to achieve wealth its really important to know which of those ways are a best for you and b going to be easiest and ecological going forward the comprehensive wealth accumulation method the wealth accumulation method helps you to work with a tool called the wealth matrix where you see how money time and love interweave into this thing called life in the end you see what actions to take when to take them how to measure your results and ultimately have what you want this course will guide you so you can begin the step by step process of breaking away from the chains that bind people to the past and the status quo and begin living an exciting hopeful abundant future perhaps you sell products and services or maybe you work at a good old fashioned job that is all history you may or may not choose to make adjustments theres lots of right answers and many times more wrong ones youll see them all play out in the game at lightning speed in just  weeks with the assistance of the course ill guide you through a method of safely and securely creating shifts in your life abundance and financial freedom are predictable commodities by taking advantage of the little known but very important prices law ill show you how you can virtually assure yourself any result you desire in any field or niche prices law makes wealth accumulation as predictable as the eventual arrival of a plane en route to a destination youll literally be able to look at yourself and say ah in order to get what i want i simply to do this and you dont have to guess its all laid out for you im just like you i had to learn the hard way the very hard way i looked at every opportunity scam and bought into more than a few it got old quickly i changed my approach i started studying the differences between people who grow wealth and those who dont i found what most of the serious students of the affluent have found most of the things reported in pop psychology books and magazines dont make much difference in achievementin greatnessin wealth you learn what you never learn in college the fact is that theres a lot of stuff both the affluent and the poor and everyone in between do this was a huge distinction and one that caused me to really scramble about a decade ago the difference in what i thought was real vs what is real was the difference of millions of dollars if you really want to achieve personal financial freedom the freedom from bills and living paycheck to paycheckyou can be quite sure it will happen everything you learn in this course will be a tangible b something you can actually do c take work but not slavery d vehicles that ive taken and can vouch for their safety wealth is best generated with very small risks im pretty risk averseok very risk averse the first decision you make is to not make stupid decisions the second decision you make it to move now ive done what i have set out to do by of having a really good playbook being smart enough to do things i find interesting or things i actually like to do and yes recognizing and getting past limitations ex i dont look like brad pitt or tom cruise if youre looking to emulate the extremes of donald trump this is the wrong place for you if you would like to live an abundant life where you achieve financial freedompersonal freedom then here is the place you will be given the keys all you have to do is turn the keys in the ignition and go its an eight week process its fascinating introspective you really learn about you youll find out how you ended up where you are youll find out exactly how to get where you want to go the approach ive developed for you is unique and it is special in that it accounts for personal significance and meaning in the equation of growing a life of abundance eight weeks where youll apply what you learn and create pathways to financial freedom in your life question if i could show you how to create the life you desired adopt the mindset of the wealthy and literally give you a stepbystep handbook to manifest your life filled with abundance  would you be interested and what happens when you put this system into practice after the course is completed key point you will know exactly what to do step by step your wealth matrix keeps you on course and moving forward at all times the comprehensive wealth

fascinating firstly because i had totally underestimated the value and effect of decisions on our lives secondly ive always been aware of some of my biases  im a fairly ardent feminist for example and

course is a fascinating voyage of selfdiscovery im enjoying the course from a learning perspective in general  your other courses that ive done have been for the purpose of improving my business

top experts in their fields and there was no sales pitch from any of the speakers they just shared their cuttingedge information i walked away very impressed with boot camp and kevin hogan i could see that kevin was very genuine in his desire to make a difference in peoples lives and he has the background knowledge and ability to truly do that i would recommend boot camp to anyone i dont care what business youre in  you will have more information than youll be able to process i have the influence boot camp  dvds and im glad i do  as i watch them i realize how much information and practical real life skills that were presented that i did not fully absorb while there it was the best learning experience of my life scott a bell  just wanted to thank you i took your decision point ecourse earlier this year and have put the ideas into practice i knew i wanted to leave my job but didnt seem able to decide when how etc well using what i learned from you i was able to make a very definitive decision about now being the time i feel great about the timing in my life now and at peace with the decisions i made this means so much to me mahalo nui loa thank you so very much stephanie smedes seattle wa i have been receiving your newsletter for a couple of years now as well as several others over that time i have weeded out most i have purchased some of your products and believe you are the real deal your insights and the wisdom you impart have been are and will be invaluable many thanks mark estlick seattle wa  you have created a cookie cutter plan to wealth via the internet with your internet marketing course all the participants must do is follow the directions amazingly easy thank you michael neumann tikrit iraq covert hypnosis my learning experience is best described as drinking from a fire hose you have provided so much valuable information in these works i have trouble deciding what to work on first in covert persuasion you explain the focused outcome mindset and you mentioned it in a recent coffee  i used to reject the idea of influencing others as manipulation and inappropriate i see now that we influence others all the time i just never took the effort to be intentional about it thanks again for your great work you have really helped me be more effective in my sales and my life i will continue to study your works dave gurnee i thought that your decision point ecourse was an excellent and incredibly valuable course the amount of information is unbelievable im going to be reviewing it for a while i have read reviews that say you overdeliver and boy do you ever i have already recommended your course to two friends thanks kevin for a great course mike hendry calgary alberta canada  the psychology of wealth included in the millionaire mind program is an amazing program that has helped me peel back the layers that have repeatedly caused me to fumble my whole life i had been repeating the same patterns and could not figure out why nor did i even notice the similarities this program has not only helped me identify the foundation of these events but has also allowed me to reprogram myself  so i dont repeat the same events by doing the selfwork in this course kevin has laid the foundation for anyone who wants to master themselves ive invested in many of the other get rich programs many of them were great but none of them discussed the sabotaging beliefs like this program and without identifying your personal road blocks youre almost guaranteed not to make it to your dream destination in life because your subconscious mind will cause you to repeat the same events over and over to avoid previous programming this program will help you identify your personal road blocks teach you to overcome them and reach your dream life i strongly recommend the psychology of wealth to anyone who is serious about achieving financial independence and changing their life brian c saviano oak brook il i enrolled in your internet marketing course and i was blown away by the content and quality of the course it exceeded my wildest expectations i was more than pleased i have recommended your course to many business associates and would encourage anyone who wants to master the internet to take your course i am still amazed at the content and deliverables you provided job well done steven chambers wwwstevechamberscom  i am in the midst of kevin hogans public speaking course and it is changing my life i started the course not entirely convinced it would provide much more than what my graduate degrees in communication and experience in public speaking and teaching had already given me i was wicked wrong kevin and the other course members are great sources of information and feedback the content provided is worth much more than the cost and you cant beat constant practice and doing vs theory and reading as a result of the course i am moving away from a theoretical and academic understanding of communication and persuasion to a practical effective doing of communication thanks lisa perry jd phd   kudos for your public speaking program and i never even have to leave the house i actually love doing inperson presentations but they arent the only way to do things i also do teleseminars and i have just launched a new joint venture project with some of the big names in internet marketing i am interviewing  of mark joyners space monkeys from his  day business turnaround kit and mark himself the participants include jason henderson michael morgan tom justin reed floren and more thank you for the inspiration the skills and giving me the courage to make this dream into reality tania baildon wealth virus expert     i have been reading your work for a very long time now years in fact i recommend your work to everyone i know and tell them to sign up for your newsletter i hope to take your speaking program because i do like the idea of controlling my future you really are about the only guy i

coffee with kevin hogan and have now taken two coursesyou rock janet james wwwjanetjamesca   i was interested in changes in my life but not knowing which direction i took a chance with your book the science of influence it looked very attractive and i found out by reading it it has great substance i changed my life and started building my own business as a financial planner and i must say your book and website have given me great help thank you for sharing your ideas especially the psychology of wealth accumulation coffee with kevin hogan and more i also have to say i have built more friends in the past  months than i made over the last  years by helping them honestly now im daring to make decisions thank you very much wolfgang schernhammer austria  “want to influence others want to persuade others want to sell others then science of influence is not just an option – it’s a landmark breakthrough of information you can use the minute you read it” jeffrey gitomer author of the little red book of selling persuasion protocol contains extensive and up to date research about persuasion and marketing kevin hogan overdelivers in terms of massive content and utterly applicable stories metaphors and ideas about persuasion i view kevin as my backup research expert who affirms or negates the viewpoints that evolve in my clinical work as a psychotherapist the only problem in buying anything by kevin hogan is that it is humbling to see how much he gets done and all that he knows however you will know far more and be far more productive when you listen to this program and put it into practice it is worth all the time and money you put into it bob beverley psychotherapist wwwfindwisdomnowcom we are only half way through this professional speakers course  and i cant believe what i have already learnedand we still have four weeks to go i have only one regret that i didnt sign up for this course two years ago interestingly enough i own many of the top books on building your speaking business and i am excited to say that kevin has revealed strategies for supercharging our speaking career that werent even hinted at in these popular books on the same topic if you are looking for someone to take your money and tell you everything youre doing is fantastic when its not then this course is probably not for you however if you are looking for someone who will tell it like it is someone who truly wants you to succeed and someone who is willing to share all of his secrets of speaking success with you then dont make the same mistake i did  enroll in this course as soon as possible kevin hogan is the real deal vincent harris trenton mo thanks for making a change in my life i never miss our coffee meeting monday mornings and it made me resign from my job and start my own venture  months ago making  times the amount of money i used to i also read your book covert persuasion awesome stuff thanks for everything johan grobler gauteng south africa

about doing kevin hogans internet marketing course was one week after we started i had a website up and running this is not the usual type of course where you receive all the subject matter and it sits on your shelf until you find the time for it oh no kevin is involved every day he send you emails with attachments he takes you step by step through the process especially in the beginning when you really need it its in your best interest to keep up with the group and whatever questions you have he answers them all you will receive absolutely everything you need to know about the internet something else that would never have happened without kevin is that my website was spidered  days after it was published and spiders crawl every  or  days like clockwork a month later my site had a page ranking of three for a newcomer going it alone this is unheard of the course was worth every penny i highly recommend it to anyone interested in setting up an internet company big or small sharon dell durban south africa inspiringdevotionalcom cosmopolitan interviewed kevin for an article on how to level the playing field in business for women  i first gave lifestorms a superficial listen just curious what it was about and at first i got nothing more out of it than a sense that it sounded cool but during the last  days i have found the miracle something inside me clicked when i began to thoroughly study the material i find myself interacting with the world as if im a new person the best part is that this difference this peace that i can not remember feeling before this seems to be not from rational studied or memorized knowledge but a sense of freedom a sense of a huge load falling off my shoulders which i did not even know was there what i have not mastered yet i now know i will because of lifestorms wow finally my friend and i after the first  minutes five days ago ever since that moment we can barely stop ourselves from discussing everything and we are excited to make time every day to study this and we dislike the moment when we have to stop because we can barely wait to see what else is there katerina spillkova san bruno ca kevin is in success magazine read secret language decoding nonverbal clues to get the edge      almost too deep to take in at one go around so ive gone through everything twice now and have a much clearer understanding amazing information kevin the decision point ecourse is absolutely amazing you have answered within this course a lifelong question for me why are  of my decisions bad ones as a matter of fact id finally gotten to the point in life where i would make a decision and then do the opposite which seemed to be a method for better resultssad isnt it so why did i mostly make bad decisions because i was making them from my gut feeling its amazing that ive been able to become a multimillionaire using this poor strategy now i truly feel you have given me the opportunity to skyrocket my future thank you so much kevin your work is truly phenomenal without question id recommend this course to friend and foe alike kate upchurch richardson texas      copyright  network  publishing all rights reserved

influence v price   just pay     the science of influence part v triggering compliance in the buying sequence audio cd volumes  released january   new program it’s here i’m very excited i didn’t release a science of influence set in  because i wanted this one to be something special… i wanted this to be the one everyone remembers science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is something that i’m more than proud of than…well…ok…not more than my kids… but you get the idea…it includes some of my finest work to date i believe you will agree and profit significantly from what you find out  hours of new information and we have some fun along the way even a couple of gaffe’s are left in like when i accidentally said something i probably shouldn’t have… the one area i’ve left open for speculation in the first  cd’s i’ve closed in science of influence  impulse activation moves your hand from their pocket to the shelf holding the magazines candy bars and nail clippers when you’re in line waiting to check out your stuff at the store impulse activation is what causes you to push “buy now” instead of surf away to a different web page impulse activation is what causes you to give a meaningful contribution to a charity even when you considered to not do so and almost no one is able to intentionally cause impulse activation except you i’ve taken a decade of research and put it all to the task of impulse activation i invest five hours of science of influence showing you specific words and simple examples of how to use the most complex research i even write out short ads and explain why they work or don’t i show you the covert psychological triggers that are the most likely to succeed and then i show you how to use them then i take you into the world of women no one has ever written about the covert psychological triggers that cause women to act or decide in your favor i have i take you through stepbystep and itemize those triggers then i show you the exact words and phrases that work when communicating with women to my knowledge no one has ever done this before and there is a lot more in the last year there has been a lot of research done in what persuades people…in what unspoken covert factors cause people to spend more money come back more often buy more products and services and i lay it out for you in easytounderstand fashion and when appropriate i take you through cuttingedge research that i promise you won’t find anywhere else in fact you probably won’t find any of this instantly practical and useful information available from others teaching persuasion influence selling or advertising for another year or two it always helps to be first… impulse activation is triggering compliance in the buying sequence…now science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is one of the finest programs i have ever created some will probably say it is “the best” learn the secrets of covert influence the latest persuasion research that no one else has including how to sell to women and subtle forms of influence i’ve never talked about anywhere before almost all of the information you experience in this program is new it’s not in any of my books it’s not in the covert hypnosis cd program it’s not in the previous science of influence series and vice versa of course this cd program is hot off the presses and contains demonstrations of nonverbal and verbal communication that you haven’t seen or experienced before you will learn how to use covert psychological triggers this necessary skill set is what separates those who are good at subtle influence… and those that are truly masters and i walk you through them demo them and show you exactly how to do the same you will be blown away promise and because i present you with so many covert psychological triggers we have included a handy triggers reference sheet that you will refer to again and again turn the cd program off after this cd and you will have one heck of a return on your investment i promise when you see what happens when you use triggers and experience the impulse to action you will be more than impressed you’ll learn how to cause uncontrollable impulses in seconds you’ll learn how to change memory it’s subtle it’s powerful oh…and i’ll tell you why you want and need to know this… next you’re going to find out the seemingly magical use of energy around you to create incredible comfort and trust or discomfort and fear i would argue that it isn’t magic that it’s science but no time for that the skills are all transferable you’re going to find out how to shape beliefs with single words or images you are going to learn how to get from “no” to “yes” you are going to see feel the energy vibrate off of me and feel it enter your mind as you learn to cause the impulse to action you will learn how to send covert verbal messages with far more power than you ever learned in nlp yeah…really everything in these  contentpacked hours of new material has been scientifically tested no guess work no bs no time wasters it’s  proven technology and it’s  heart you will have fun and learn at the same time unlike most programs you listen to i explain everything i do it’s all here for you this program just released comes on  audio cd’s it’s everything that you’ve ever dreamed of including the manual which is rich in research and yes the use of exact words and phrases for influencing when possible you are the first to have this incredible program and i am proud that you will because as you come to understand the mind of the other person you’ll also be learning  how to create the “gotta have it” feeling in consumers how to melt away sales resistance how to tap into the “primal” buying emotions how to literally and instantly establish rapport how to ’cause’ consumers to obey your hidden ‘sales push’ how to infuse “proof power” into your sales letters how to arouse your prospect’s inner buying drives how to influence your prospects mind to trust you how to bypass your prospect’s conscious mind in a nutshell you’ll learn how to create influential messages that hold customers captive from the first words you say to the signing of the check in science of influence  you will learn how to cause them to identify with you combine two key drivers that will cause compulsion to comply form questions that will cause compliance when asked never have that “phoney feeling” inside again…and instantly watch your income increase use the power of the invisibility intensifier take advantage of kevin’s full christmas tree technique optimize the use of their feeling of fear and… determine which of the five basic fears to utilize in your presentation or copy adopt key characteristics of god that make you more persuasive even if you are agnostic use features instead of benefits to close the deal send the energy of being the problem solver to those you influence use sex and sensuality to sell clear and simple modify old sales strategies to become influential in  be the person that imbues them with good feelings…they won’t want you to leave link good feelings with buying now plus…  take advantage of the impulse to instant gratification with you your product and service building trust and credibility is one of the most difficult things for anyone to do i’ve put together some very easy methods for you to accelerate the process to almost instantaneous but please do note that getting trust and credibility immediately does have a danger if you don’t deliver you will lose if you can deliver you will be have a bonded relationship forever this alone is worth far more than the tiny investment in science of influence triggering compliance in the buying sequence i’ll show you how to do it…don’t abuse it… i’m also going to teach you a few of my personal favorite impulse activators including the “i’m an idiot” trigger oddly irresistible the single word strategy that causes compliance now the noncompetition technique that creates longterm connections between you and your client the “it’s a fact because i said it’s a fact” tactic the power of impulse activation is that in most cases it moves the person past skepticism and criticality…almost instantly i’m going to compare messages verbally and in text for you i’m going to show you what works and what doesn’t verbally and in writing nuances make huge differences i watch people use the right tone of voice and great body language and get a “no” because they blew it with words even more often i observe people saying the right words but completely screwing up because their tonality and pitch of voice offend the other person i’ll show you how to do it right… and i’ll show you how to do things that everyone else told you not to i’ll show you how and when to use logic in the buying sequence i’ll show you when to be politically correct and when not to i’ll show you how to influence women indepth like i’ve never done before the science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is utterly unique among all programs about persuasion and selling because for the first time you will find out exactly how to influence women whether you are a man or a woman doesn’t matter what matters is how you will use what you discover here women react and respond very differently than men to influence attempts the chances are very good that your business is heavily weighted with either  male or  female clients and customers i’m going to show you how to gain compliance from the women you’ve been missing out on i’ll give you the exact words that are required to influence and sell women i will show you the precise attitude that is required to market effectively to women you’re going to have it all in science

– science of influence v price   just pay   the science of influence part v triggering compliance in the buying sequence audio cd volumes  released january   new program it’s here i’m very excited i didn’t release a science of influence set in  because i wanted this one to be something special… i wanted this to be the one everyone remembers science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is something that i’m more than proud of than…well…ok…not more than my kids… but you get the idea…it includes some of my finest work to date i believe you will agree and profit significantly from what you find out  hours of new information and we have some fun along the way even a couple of gaffe’s are left in like when i accidentally said something i probably shouldn’t have… the one area i’ve left open for speculation in the first  cd’s i’ve closed in science of influence  impulse activation moves your hand from their pocket to the shelf holding the magazines candy bars and nail clippers when you’re in line waiting to check out your stuff at the store impulse activation is what causes you to push “buy now” instead of surf away to a different web page impulse activation is what causes you to give a meaningful contribution to a charity even when you considered to not do so and almost no one is able to intentionally cause impulse activation except you i’ve taken a decade of research and put it all to the task of impulse activation i invest five hours of science of influence showing you specific words and simple examples of how to use the most complex research i even write out short ads and explain why they work or don’t i show you the covert psychological triggers that are the most likely to succeed and then i show you how to use them then i take you into the world of women no one has ever written about the covert psychological triggers that cause women to act or decide in your favor i have i take you through stepbystep and itemize those triggers then i show you the exact words and phrases that work when communicating with women to my knowledge no one has ever done this before and there is a lot more in the last year there has been a lot of research done in what persuades people…in what unspoken covert factors cause people to spend more money come back more often buy more products and services and i lay it out for you in easytounderstand fashion and when appropriate i take you through cuttingedge research that i promise you won’t find anywhere else in fact you probably won’t find any of this instantly practical and useful information available from others teaching persuasion influence selling or advertising for another year or two it always helps to be first… impulse activation is triggering compliance in the buying sequence…now science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is one of the finest programs i have ever created some will probably say it is “the best” learn the secrets of covert influence the latest persuasion research that no one else has including how to sell to women and subtle forms of influence i’ve never talked about anywhere before almost all of the information you experience in this program is new it’s not in any of my books it’s not in the covert hypnosis cd program it’s not in the previous science of influence series and vice versa of course this cd program is hot off the presses and contains demonstrations of nonverbal and verbal communication that you haven’t seen or experienced before you will learn how to use covert psychological triggers this necessary skill set is what separates those who are good at subtle influence… and those that are truly masters and i walk you through them demo them and show you exactly how to do the same you will be blown away promise and because i present you with so many covert psychological triggers we have included a handy triggers reference sheet that you will refer to again and again turn the cd program off after this cd and you will have one heck of a return on your investment i promise when you see what happens when you use triggers and experience the impulse to action you will be more than impressed you’ll learn how to cause uncontrollable impulses in seconds you’ll learn how to change memory it’s subtle it’s powerful oh…and i’ll tell you why you want and need to know this… next you’re going to find out the seemingly magical use of energy around you to create incredible comfort and trust or discomfort and fear i would argue that it isn’t magic that it’s science but no time for that the skills are all transferable you’re going to find out how to shape beliefs with single words or images you are going to learn how to get from “no” to “yes” you are going to see feel the energy vibrate off of me and feel it enter your mind as you learn to cause the impulse to action you will learn how to send covert verbal messages with far more power than you ever learned in nlp yeah…really everything in these  contentpacked hours of new material has been scientifically tested no guess work no bs no time wasters it’s  proven technology and it’s  heart you will have fun and learn at the same time unlike most programs you listen to i explain everything i do it’s all here for you this program just released comes on  audio cd’s it’s everything that you’ve ever dreamed of including the manual which is rich in research and yes the use of exact words and phrases for influencing when possible you are the first to have this incredible program and i am proud that you will because as you come to understand the mind of the other person you’ll also be learning  how to create the “gotta have it” feeling in consumers how to melt away sales resistance how to tap into the “primal” buying emotions how to literally and instantly establish rapport how to ’cause’ consumers to obey your hidden ‘sales push’ how to infuse “proof power” into your sales letters how to arouse your prospect’s inner buying drives how to influence your prospects mind to trust you how to bypass your prospect’s conscious mind in a nutshell you’ll learn how to create influential messages that hold customers captive from the first words you say to the signing of the check in science of influence  you will learn how to cause them to identify with you combine two key drivers that will cause compulsion to comply form questions that will cause compliance when asked never have that “phoney feeling” inside again…and instantly watch your income increase use the power of the invisibility intensifier take advantage of kevin’s full christmas tree technique optimize the use of their feeling of fear and… determine which of the five basic fears to utilize in your presentation or copy adopt key characteristics of god that make you more persuasive even if you are agnostic use features instead of benefits to close the deal send the energy of being the problem solver to those you influence use sex and sensuality to sell clear and simple modify old sales strategies to become influential in  be the person that imbues them with good feelings…they won’t want you to leave link good feelings with buying now plus…  take advantage of the impulse to instant gratification with you your product and service building trust and credibility is one of the most difficult things for anyone to do i’ve put together some very easy methods for you to accelerate the process to almost instantaneous but please do note that getting trust and credibility immediately does have a danger if you don’t deliver you will lose if you can deliver you will be have a bonded relationship forever this alone is worth far more than the tiny investment in science of influence triggering compliance in the buying sequence i’ll show you how to do it…don’t abuse it… i’m also going to teach you a few of my personal favorite impulse activators including the “i’m an idiot” trigger oddly irresistible the single word strategy that causes compliance now the noncompetition technique that creates longterm connections between you and your client the “it’s a fact because i said it’s a fact” tactic the power of impulse activation is that in most cases it moves the person past skepticism and criticality…almost instantly i’m going to compare messages verbally and in text for you i’m going to show you what works and what doesn’t verbally and in writing nuances make huge differences i watch people use the right tone of voice and great body language and get a “no” because they blew it with words even more often i observe people saying the right words but completely screwing up because their tonality and pitch of voice offend the other person i’ll show you how to do it right… and i’ll show you how to do things that everyone else told you not to i’ll show you how and when to use logic in the buying sequence i’ll show you when to be politically correct and when not to i’ll show you how to influence women indepth like i’ve never done before the science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is utterly unique among all programs about persuasion and selling because for the first time you will find out exactly how to influence women whether you are a man or a woman doesn’t matter what matters is how you will use what you discover here women react and respond very differently than men to influence attempts the chances are very good that your business is heavily weighted with either  male or  female clients and customers i’m going to show you how to gain compliance from the women you’ve been missing out on i’ll give you the exact words that are required to influence and sell women i will show you the precise attitude that is required to market effectively to women you’re

hogan – persuasion protocol price   just pay   sale page  httpstorekevinhogancompersuasionprotocolaspx “imagine…in every interaction in the real world or online how would your life be different if people were desperate to instantly say ‘yes’ to you” the persuasion protocol by kevin hogan use the “add to cart” button below automatic compliance is the stuff of science fiction it simply sounds too good too scary to be true… it seems instantly unreasonable that you could have the same more precisely similar effect on that person… over there… as say angelina jolie brad pitt or kim kardashian would humans are neurobiologically wired to react instantly to two specific flash perceptions when they see anyone instant ingroup recognition triggering “all is safe and secure allow entrance interactions are to my benefit” attractiveness which triggers one of these “i want them i want to be seen with them i want to be seen and liked by them i want to be near them i want them to want to be near me” if you don’t generate that instant flash reactance and resistance occur and the most likely response is always “no” until today literally no one has ever released a program a book a manual a video…no one has shown you anything ever that “generates the automatic first reaction of certainty which yields “yes come in i am comfortable with you i feel like i’ve known you forever and i’m open to pretty much anything” why because until the last decade there were  pieces of research about attractiveness and liking compared to every  piece of research on generating instant calm security comfort and connection in the last few years this has begun to change because of major technological advances in neurobiology and nonconscious and subliminal stimulation yet nothing shows the individual the salesperson sales letter writer the marketer even the pua how to assemble the five elements into one workable easy to use method…the persuasion protocol the two nonconscious neural responses are different from each other they accomplish the same crucial result they open the door to agreement and compliance the benefit of their certainty reaction is that it doesn’t operate if there is reactance or resistance the negative reactant response is far and away the most common and only attractiveness counters it in a fashion similar to that of certainty you’ll learn how that happens and how to make it real in the program use the “add to cart” button below for the first time ever you are on the same playing field as the wickedly good looking guy or gal who gets the majority of the sales that was my goal in creating this program for you it has been accomplished… the persuasion protocol the fifth element you’ve waited over one year for this and it has just arrived you’ll understand the delay when you listen to the program you’ll notice my voice “changes” within individual cd’s because i had a serious vocal cord problem and had to rerecord many tracks so you wouldn’t think i was the bass singer in some musical group i was only supposed to record short clips daily but that didn’t quite happen the persuasion protocol takes you through an elegant stepbystep method of gaining compliance from almost anyone you could ever imagine wanting to say “yes” to you it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen or experienced before unlike any program ever developed in the field of influence and persuasion or selling you will begin by making your self almost impossible to say “no” to…you persuasion begins before you walk in the door the actual process of persuasion begins long before you meet the girl or have an appointment with the buyer persuading those who come to your website begins before they arrive at your website “are you talking about preparing for the sale i know about that…” …uh…no…that was  “are you talking about making yourself look as attractive as you can” …again…no…no…no…the persuasion protocol transcends attractiveness but don’t get me wrong if you look like angelina or brad…you will have a double advantage if you are like anyone else you simply have the only single advantage you would ever need or want the first element i’ve spent the last  months scouring crucial neuroscience research poring through consumer marketing and behavioral findings so that you can have a complete “package” that people instantly say “yes” to before that first impression understand…while your mastery of body language and nonverbal communication are important it is secondary and not as important by comparison to your preparing their brain to instantly opt to comply with you upon first sight and communication …sounds like magic to me…but i promise it’s not it’s also not instantly easy and “fast” it is something you can accomplish it is something you must accomplish use the “add to cart” button below i’ll spare you the scientific jargon and say it this way people have prior experience with thousands of people they have interactions with people who they lived with whom they have spent a great deal of time those experiences each are very different and when presented with a similar moment in time the parts of the brain that reacted to similar situations in the past arise instantly in the present ready to solve the problems and fight the fights of the past and that is the problem before people see you your website or even know you exist they are  prepared for who you are not going to be after you have completed this program i’ve developed a very simple process that requires  days to complete it will permanently change how people will react and respond to you in the situations they would have said “no” in the past the problem you face is that people paint a picture of you as if you are a mirror reflection of their past experience upon meeting you or arriving at your website it is mission critical to have that reflection changed to a picture of a gestalt of those they have complied with in the past this seemingly herculean task assuming they are undistracted must take place in approximately one second the first two discs of this program cover quite a bit of persuasive territory the first core experience is for you to intentionally create a few microtweaks in how you will trigger reactions in other people on sight and then later in conversation or in text would people instantly react differently to you if they saw you as brad pitt lucy pinder angelina jolie kat dennings jessica alba it’s a different set of highways in the brain but for the purpose of this moment go with that their brain is simply wired “this way” how they would be mentally prepared to comply or agree to pretty much anything you ask them problem yes i can’t make you look like brad…i can’t make me look like brad… doesn’t matter there is another way… this initial trigger is crucial or they will react to you in such a way that is similar to a how you have triggered people in the past b how they have perceived people now gestalted into “you” in similar situations in the past…even if they’ve never met you heard you speak been to your website or had a clue you were alive i will show you precisely how to take the video recording of your life and change the few crucial pieces where other people were triggered to say “no” to you in such a way that those experiences are no longer reflected in your personality persona your face or even your body language as you guessed this has nothing to do with making changes in body language this is changing a few tiny little pieces of you that trigger mirror neurons to react in others this is not a bogus nlp “technique” that never got tested this shifting mechanism was trial and errored until the right solution was discovered in testing in other words this is real where you currently have success in influencing others you make no changes in these situations your current beliefs certainties and behaviors are already effective where you haven’t been ideally successful with persuasion you will excise a few pieces of your life video recording so that you send a custom designed message with greater likelihood for others to say “yes” to you isolating the specific points to shift is not difficult and the process is fairly simple warning this is not like instant coffee it takes effort but once the change is made it’s permanent the result is that you’ll see most people and their likely response to you through a lens of high certainty and reduce internal triggers to move away from you to almost nil you now begin to shape all people who you come across in the way you choose instead of default which is indeed a fault the second element the protocol for effective and rapid persuasion flows fluidly easily and obviously to the second element here you learn to control the time constructs each person has as it relates to their being persuaded by you you must choose precisely when you are going to approach meet ask for the date or have people arrive at your website the arrival time is crucial and you can predetermine whether you are virtually certain to gain compliance or not quite easily before you enter their space the second element is not limited to “what time is it” but “what day is it” “what date is it” “what month is it” and how you account for the differences in how they will react to you on each of those specific days hours weeks and months once you learn to utilize this one very easy to grasp tool you will never be seen quite the same their reaction to you and their compliance or not is much more than about your “first impression” or your what you say it’s about a very specific individual with a specific mindset interacting with you at an absolutely optimum time i’ve left nothing to chance here i’ve put the factors of the second element together into a template and laid it out for you for an hourly daily weekly and even monthly schedule of how to optimize all of your interactions with brilliant timing intention use the “add to cart” button below it’s here that you’ll be introduced to the unknown factor that stops persuasion cold and discover how to completely bypass it i’ve only shown three corporations how to do this i’ve never trained it in boot camp no one else has put this into interactions sales marketing…no one this is brand new for you the third element it is no coincidence that most of the successful online marketers have strong backgrounds in two specific and frankly not easy to master hypnosis models drawing from even simple but powerful hypnotic techniques has allowed marketers to target states of mind or subroutines within individuals to increase sales but before you can use these techniques you have to learn how to cause someone to be in a specific state of mind random doesn’t work beyond random feeble attempts typically fail now you learn what…and how different “subselves” the actual neurobiological term are activated in different environments and in the presence of different people this is why it is critical to make instant shifts in environment location people and triggers in the environment a key factor in the third element of the persuasion protocol equally as important is you being aware of how you are perceived at any moment of an interaction the passive goal guidance system running their brain and shifting their selves you can predict behavior when you recognize “the state” the part that is forward in their brain if your prediction is that compliance will fail you change what part of them is forward until you can gain compliance the first state or part will likely be forward until the passive goal guidance system has met a tiny goal and switches out now you learn how to optimize the use of anyone’s pggs for rapid compliance the fourth element without question the great marketing and sales discoveries of the last decade are those that give you applications to synchronize identities with another individual this can be true in face to face communication writing sales letters and direct mail…in fact…it’s applicable to texting and social media the fourth element is fusing bonds with their most secret identity without question the greatest marketing study ever done allows you to see the results of connecting with that hidden identity ironically no one has even remotely heard of this study inside the world of salespeople and marketers strange that you’ll now possess the knowledge of what was discovered works in marketing…and what doesn’t…and specific implementation points for you  people were involved in this study a record and you have the results the fifth element like the first four elements the fifth element is new to your understanding of persuasion behavior guidance and compliance discovering and then shifting their identification protocol is something no one has talked about in the real world the reason is that it’s one of those things no one wants to talk about causing people to do what you want to is very simple when you understand and work within their identity as it intersects with yours the emotional shift protocol people’s bias toward certain behaviors is very predictable example the optimistic individual meets their inner drive to maintain the status quo with behaviors that you can predict and control these biases meet head on their bias toward over estimation creating frustration anger and other emotions that can be remarkably valuable in the persuasion process if you know what to do with them…saving the best for last… the great st century influence studys results are yours – no one else has them… the most important influence study of this century gives you specific actions to take to influence others then you learn precisely what not to do and how to use this in many different contexts absolutely brilliant in scope and magnitude with the side effect being that people report they don’t even remember what caused them to behave differently “peruasion protocol contains extensive and up to date research about persuasion and marketing kevin hogan overdelivers in terms of massive content and utterly applicable stories metaphors and ideas about persuasion i view kevin as my backup research expert who affirms or negates the viewpoints that evolve in my clinical work as a psychotherapist the only problem in buying anything by kevin hogan is that it is humbling to see how much he gets done and all that he knows however you will know far more and be far more productive when you listen to this program and put it into practice it is worth all the time and money you put into it” bob beverley psychotherapist wwwfindwisdomnowcom new strategies never before seen this program is not only unique to my work but also to the field of influence persuasion sales and marketing that means that for the most part not only is this “new” but the interaction between the five elements is absolutely singular in power i guarantee you’ll be the first person as will the others who get this program…it’s not really just you and me to have this it’s far beyond “cutting edge” do precisely what you are instructed to do in the persuasion protocol and you will own your self and you will own their reaction and response to you it is difficult to construct scenarios where the persuasion protocol is ineffective because it was designed to loop to agreement there is no real testexitfail option in the system it’s simply the most potent information about persuasion ever prepared for anyone this doesn’t mean someone isn’t going to say “no” to you at some point you might step over a line that someone else won’t ever cross under any circumstances but because of the methodology you wouldn’t go there in the first place because it offers a significantly possible response of “no” the program is a bit over  hours and uses  cd’s there is an extremely important  page guide on cd as well if you do what is in the guide in addition to what you learn in the cd’s you’ll have a brilliant story to tell me the next time we see each other if you don’t use the manual with the cd’s at least once you’ve missed the boat there are actions you must take outside of your university on wheels for this to all coalesce you can now pick up the program at a significantly reduced price and have the finest persuasion program ever developed you’ll see your personal effectiveness charisma persona grow by leaps the persuasion protocol by kevin hogan why do this the persuasion protocol is unique you don’t have this no one has this it will not be sold at a lower price at any point in the next several

influence part v triggering compliance in the buying sequence audio cd volumes  released january   new program it’s here i’m very excited i didn’t release a science of influence set in  because i wanted this one to be something special… i wanted this to be the one everyone remembers science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is something that i’m more than proud of than…well…ok…not more than my kids… but you get the idea…it includes some of my finest work to date i believe you will agree and profit significantly from what you find out  hours of new information and we have some fun along the way even a couple of gaffe’s are left in like when i accidentally said something i probably shouldn’t have… the one area i’ve left open for speculation in the first  cd’s i’ve closed in science of influence  impulse activation moves your hand from their pocket to the shelf holding the magazines candy bars and nail clippers when you’re in line waiting to check out your stuff at the store impulse activation is what causes you to push “buy now” instead of surf away to a different web page impulse activation is what causes you to give a meaningful contribution to a charity even when you considered to not do so and almost no one is able to intentionally cause impulse activation except you i’ve taken a decade of research and put it all to the task of impulse activation i invest five hours of science of influence showing you specific words and simple examples of how to use the most complex research i even write out short ads and explain why they work or don’t i show you the covert psychological triggers that are the most likely to succeed and then i show you how to use them then i take you into the world of women no one has ever written about the covert psychological triggers that cause women to act or decide in your favor i have i take you through stepbystep and itemize those triggers then i show you the exact words and phrases that work when communicating with women to my knowledge no one has ever done this before and there is a lot more in the last year there has been a lot of research done in what persuades people…in what unspoken covert factors cause people to spend more money come back more often buy more products and services and i lay it out for you in easytounderstand fashion and when appropriate i take you through cuttingedge research that i promise you won’t find anywhere else in fact you probably won’t find any of this instantly practical and useful information available from others teaching persuasion influence selling or advertising for another year or two it always helps to be first… impulse activation is triggering compliance in the buying sequence…now science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is one of the finest programs i have ever created some will probably say it is “the best” learn the secrets of covert influence the latest persuasion research that no one else has including how to sell to women and subtle forms of influence i’ve never talked about anywhere before almost all of the information you experience in this program is new it’s not in any of my books it’s not in the covert hypnosis cd program it’s not in the previous science of influence series and vice versa of course this cd program is hot off the presses and contains demonstrations of nonverbal and verbal communication that you haven’t seen or experienced before you will learn how to use covert psychological triggers this necessary skill set is what separates those who are good at subtle influence… and those that are truly masters and i walk you through them demo them and show you exactly how to do the same you will be blown away promise and because i present you with so many covert psychological triggers we have included a handy triggers reference sheet that you will refer to again and again turn the cd program off after this cd and you will have one heck of a return on your investment i promise when you see what happens when you use triggers and experience the impulse to action you will be more than impressed you’ll learn how to cause uncontrollable impulses in seconds you’ll learn how to change memory it’s subtle it’s powerful oh…and i’ll tell you why you want and need to know this… next you’re going to find out the seemingly magical use of energy around you to create incredible comfort and trust or discomfort and fear i would argue that it isn’t magic that it’s science but no time for that the skills are all transferable you’re going to find out how to shape beliefs with single words or images you are going to learn how to get from “no” to “yes” you are going to see feel the energy vibrate off of me and feel it enter your mind as you learn to cause the impulse to action you will learn how to send covert verbal messages with far more power than you ever learned in nlp yeah…really everything in these  contentpacked hours of new material has been scientifically tested no guess work no bs no time wasters it’s  proven technology and it’s  heart you will have fun and learn at the same time unlike most programs you listen to i explain everything i do it’s all here for you this program just released comes on  audio cd’s it’s everything that you’ve ever dreamed of including the manual which is rich in research and yes the use of exact words and phrases for influencing when possible you are the first to have this incredible program and i am proud that you will because as you come to understand the mind of the other person you’ll also be learning  how to create the “gotta have it” feeling in consumers how to melt away sales resistance how to tap into the “primal” buying emotions how to literally and instantly establish rapport how to ’cause’ consumers to obey your hidden ‘sales push’ how to infuse “proof power” into your sales letters how to arouse your prospect’s inner buying drives how to influence your prospect�s mind to trust you how to bypass your prospect’s conscious mind in a nutshell you’ll learn how to create influential messages that hold customers captive from the first words you say to the signing of the check in science of influence  you will learn how to cause them to identify with you combine two key drivers that will cause compulsion to comply form questions that will cause compliance when asked never have that “phoney feeling” inside again…and instantly watch your income increase use the power of the invisibility intensifier take advantage of kevin’s full christmas tree technique optimize the use of their feeling of fear and… determine which of the five basic fears to utilize in your presentation or copy adopt key characteristics of god that make you more persuasive even if you are agnostic use features instead of benefits to close the deal send the energy of being the problem solver to those you influence use sex and sensuality to sell clear and simple modify old sales strategies to become influential in  be the person that imbues them with good feelings…they won’t want you to leave link good feelings with buying now plus…  take advantage of the impulse to instant gratification with you your product and service building trust and credibility is one of the most difficult things for anyone to do i’ve put together some very easy methods for you to accelerate the process to almost instantaneous but please do note that getting trust and credibility immediately does have a danger if you don’t deliver you will lose if you can deliver you will be have a bonded relationship forever this alone is worth far more than the tiny investment in science of influence triggering compliance in the buying sequence i’ll show you how to do it…don’t abuse it… i’m also going to teach you a few of my personal favorite impulse activators including the “i’m an idiot” trigger oddly irresistible the single word strategy that causes compliance now the noncompetition technique that creates longterm connections between you and your client the “it’s a fact because i said it’s a fact” tactic the power of impulse activation is that in most cases it moves the person past skepticism and criticality…almost instantly i’m going to compare messages verbally and in text for you i’m going to show you what works and what doesn’t verbally and in writing nuances make huge differences i watch people use the right tone of voice and great body language and get a “no” because they blew it with words even more often i observe people saying the right words but completely screwing up because their tonality and pitch of voice offend the other person i’ll show you how to do it right… and i’ll show you how to do things that everyone else told you not to i’ll show you how and when to use logic in the buying sequence i’ll show you when to be politically correct and when not to i’ll show you how to influence women indepth like i’ve never done before the science of influence  triggering compliance in the buying sequence is utterly unique among all programs about persuasion and selling because for the first time you will find out exactly how to influence women whether you are a man or a woman doesn’t matter what matters is how you will use what you discover here women react and respond very differently than men to influence attempts the chances are very good that your business is heavily weighted with either  male or  female clients and customers i’m going to show you how to gain compliance from the women you’ve been missing out on i’ll give you the exact words that are required to influence and sell women i will show you the precise attitude that is required to market effectively to women you’re going to have it all in science of influence triggering compliance in
