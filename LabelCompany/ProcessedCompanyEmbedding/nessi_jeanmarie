software and services initiative nessi for new samplingsensor initiative is a global and open initiative sponsored by the center for process analysis and control cpac at the university of washington in seattle the nessi initiative was begun to simplify the tasks and reduce the overall costs associated with engineering installing and maintaining chemical process analytical systems process analytical systems are commonly used by the chemical oil refining and petrochemical industries to measure and control both chemical composition as well as certain intrinsic physical properties such as viscosity the specific objectives of nessi are increasing the reliability of these systems through the use of increased automation shrinking their physical size and energy use by means of miniaturization promoting the creation and use of industry standards for process analytical systems helping create the infrastructure needed to support the use of the emerging class of robust and selective microanalytical sensors to date nessi has served as a forum for the adoption and improvement of an industrial standard which specifies the use of miniature and modular legolike flow components nessi has also issued a specification which has been instrumental in spurring the development and commercialization of a plug and play low power communication bus nessibus specifically designed for use with process analytical sample systems in electrically hazardous environments as part of its development road map nessi has defined the electrical and mechanical interfaces as well as compiled a list of automated smart software features which are now beginning to be used by microanalytical manufacturers for industrial applications contents  background  history  nessi technical objectives  technology development roadmap  technical development generations  generation i fluid components  generation ii connectivity using nessibus and the sam  generation iii  microanalytical  applications  role of cpac  criticism impact and summary  references  external links backgroundedit conventional sample system in an analyzer house ca  modern chemical and petrochemical processing plants are complex systems containing many steps often called unit operations involved in producing one or more products from various raw materials in order to control the many processes for both improved product quality and operational safety many measurements are made at the different stages of processing these measurements either from simple sensors such as temperature pressure flow etc or from sophisticated chemical analyzers providing composition of one or more components in the chemical stream are typically used as inputs to process control algorithms to give a snapshot of the process operation and to control the process to ensure it is operating efficiently and safely traditionally most of the measurements with the exception of temperature pressure and flow were performed offline by taking a sample from the process and analyzing it in the laboratory beginning in the latter of part of the s a trend aimed at moving the analysis from the laboratory to the process plant began with the advent of more sophisticated analyzers this concept known as process analytics become much more prevalent in the s and a new discipline called process analytical chemistry pac emerged which combined chemical engineering and analytical chemistry one of the main driving forces for pac see also a more recent but related development in the pharmaceutical industry called pat is to remove the bottleneck and time lag associated with sending the samples to the lab and waiting for the analysis results by moving the analysis to the process results can be obtained closer to realtime which effectively improves the ability for the control action to correct for process changes ie feedback and feed forward control by far the most common implementation of pac especially for more complex analyzers utilizes what is known as extractive sampling this typically involves the continuous or sometimes periodic removal of a small portion of sample from a much larger piping system or process vessel this sample is then conditioned filtered pressure regulated flow controlled etc and introduced to the analyzer where the chemical composition or the intrinsic physical properties of process fluids vapours and liquids are measured in the industrial plants the majority of sample systems and their related analyzers are installed in analyzer houses the hardware traditionally metal tubing compression fittings valves regulators rotameters and filters associated with extractive sampling is collectively referred to as the sampling system sample systems are used to condition or adjust the sample conditions pressure amount of particulate allowed temperature and flow to a level suitable for use with an analytical device analyzer such as a gas chromatograph an oxygen analyzer or an infra red spectrometer despite the simple explanation just given modern sampling systems can be quite large complex and expensive the design features of analytical sample systems have changed little when the discipline of process analytics began in germany right through until the present day an example of an early analyzer and sample system used at the buna chemical works schkopau germany is shown in the following photograph process analytics remains exceptional in the fact that it is the last outpost of low level automation retains manual adjustments and visible checks within the process industries analyzer and associated sample system schkopau germany ca  historyedit the rationale for nessi originated from focus group meetings held in  at the center for process analytical chemistry cpac which called out for more reliable sampling and analysis for the manufacturing processes early work with nessi was started in july  by peter van vuuren exxonmobil chemical and rob dubois dow chemical with the initial aim of adopting new types of modular and miniature hardware which were being addressed in a standard being developed by an isa instrumentation systems and automation society technical committee reference  the term nessi along with the futuristic concepts of a communicationpower bus specifically designed for process analytical the nessibus and fully automated sampling systems were first introduced outside of cpac at a presentation given in january  at the international forum of process analytical chemistry ifpac at amelia island florida usa these new concepts were collected in the nessi generation ii specification and released by cpac in  as an open publication the specification is located on the cpac website reference  nessi technical objectivesedit facilitate the acceptance and implementation of modular miniature and automated smart sample system technology using the mechanical design based on the ansiisa sp standardansi  american national standards institute provide the mechanical electrical and software infrastructure needed to accelerate the use of microanalytical sensors within the process industries move the analytical systems out of the analyzer houses by promoting the use of fieldmounted analytical systems similar to pressure transmitters which are closecoupled to the major process equipment nessi refers to this concept as byline analysis lay the groundwork for the adoption of an open communication standards for process analytical this includes communication between sample system components such as flow sensors actuators and microanalytical sensors as well as communication to a distributed control system dcs comparison of current technology vs nessi technology extractive systems current technology nessi technology when fully developed analyzer shelters analytical system close to the sampling point byline long heattraced transfer lines short lines fast response extensive design required simplify design by the use of web based design tools standard component symbol sets and more common use of modularfunctional design blocks custom assembly modular assembly field repair modular replacement preventive maintenance required personnel needed to monitor flows temperatures and pressures sometimes on a daily round basis predictive maintenance diagnostic data is logged automatically and action taken only when needed typically a low level of automation in the sampling system high level automation  pressure temperature flow and heaters monitored and controlled large amount of sample small amount of sample less material to condition conduits seals armoured cable purging and pressurization simple plugin connector unarmoured wiring using miniature flexible cable large space required small compact low internal volume multiple independent systems tighter integration of the sampling system with its analyzer and other support infrastructure such as heat tracing and sample disposal technology development roadmapedit technology development roadmap pyramid the nessi technology development roadmap groups the technology into three generations which are backward compatible generation i is a commercial product and proven in numerous industrial and laboratory applications generation ii products have been proven in the laboratory but have yet to be commercialized generation iii microanalytical is in development technical development generationsedit generation i fluid componentsedit generation i covers the commercially available mechanical systems associated with the fluid handling components generation i has adopted the ansiisa sp miniature modular mechanical standard this standard precisely defines inlet and outlet ports and overall dimensions which allow legolike interchangeability of components between different manufacturers the ansiisa standard is referenced by the international electrotechnical commission in publication iec  the ansiisa sp standard defines dimensions and porting currently three manufacturers produce the mechanical mounting system known as a substrate which serves as the platform for attaching various components since the components are bolted to the surface of the substrate with sealing done by orings they are sometimes referred to as surface mount devices the semiconductor industry has a related system however the sealing is done by metallic seals rather than elastomeric orings there are currently over  different types of surface mount components available from various suppliers who provide valves filters and regulators as well as pressure and flow sensing devices although the platform for mounting various components is common among the manufacturers the interconnections below the surface are proprietary the following figure shows three of the common designs from left to right a swagelok system which uses various lengths of tube connectors set in rigid channels a circortech design which uses a single block with assorted flowtubes and a parker hannifin design which uses various blocks ported together with small connectors which also serve as flow paths the figure below illustrates the spacing differences between a conventional system and a modular sample system generation ii connectivity using nessibus and the samedit the key elements of the nessi generation ii specification are as follows adoption of a digital communication bus nessibus that is specifically tailored for process analytics and intended to replace  ma systems this bus can handle up to  devices this bus would be equivalent to a plugandplay usb bus on a personal computer but with special requirements for electrical equipment in hazardous areas classifying the interior of an enclosure handling hazardous flammable fluids eg hydrogen and ethylene as division zone  rather than divisionzone  adopting the use of a safe low energy globally accepted method of electrical protection called intrinsic safety for the nessibus adopting the use of miniature smartautomated electronic devices including sensors flow pressure temperature onoff and proportional actuators and enclosure heater controls a move away from the use of local indicating devices such as gauges and rotameters in order to reduce laborintensive manual checking rounds a move away from centralized control automation model to a localfield control model which is represented by a small computing device called the sensor actuator manager sam adopting the concept of portable commercially available software smart applets for the purpose of automating specific sample system functions these applets would be resident in the sam employing an ethernet network between the sam the dcs and the operator  maintenance o  m user station nessi refers to this bus as the anlan introduction of a graphical user interface gui for better visualization of physically compact sampling systems generation ii connectivity model using nessibus and sam the first prototype of a multi nodeminiature generation ii system was demonstrated by siemens process analytics in  siemens has adapted an existing bus system called ic to operate in an intrinsically safe mode this work was undertaken once it was determined that existing intrinsically safe capable digital communication systems such as foundation fieldbus and profibus could not meet the requirements of reduced physical size as well as the lower cost and power draw defined by the nessibus whether or not this bus will go into wide commercial production is unknown at this time an example of a generation  system a nonprofit organization can in automation cia released in  a draft standard proposal dsp that specifies the physical layer of an intrinsically safe bus can  controller area network the specification has been developed by members of the cia organization among them abb pepperlfuchs texas instruments and siemens by using a lower voltage  v for its power supply this bus can provide more current up to  ma to power multiple devices in a hazardous environment this group has standardized upon the pin m pico connector for providing both power and signal to the devices a commercial implementation of a process analytical system using this bus has yet to be demonstrated an interim development called generation  uses both conventional  ma analogue sensors and discrete signals to actuate valves a programmable logic controller plc is used as the sensor actuator manager sam generation iii  microanalyticaledit the introduction of new microanalytical devices to the process industries can be enabled by employing standard physical electrical and software interfaces generation iii will allow tighter integration of the sample conditioning and analytical measurement devices an example of an integrated analytical device oxygen transmitter and sampling system applicationsedit nessi is used for process analytical measurements in the petrochemical chemical and oil refining industries these measurements may be for quality control of raw material or final product environmental compliance safety energy reduction or process control purposes vapour applications may include hydrocarbon feed stocks and intermediates ethylene ethane propylene etc natural gas streams liquefied petroleum gas lpg streams hydrogen and air gas streams liquid systems suitable for use with the generation i mechanical portion of nessi are hydrocarbons such as diesel fuel as well as aqueous streams highly viscous fluids and solids are not suitable for use with nessi very dirty high particulate streams need to be filtered some liquid service applications may be limited by pressure drops associated with components hooked up in a serial configuration nessi systems have found applications in areas other than the process analytical environments including micro reactor mini plant and laboratory environments where small size unskilled assembly and flexible configuration is important role of cpacedit the development of nessi has been a collaborative effort between industrial endusers manufacturers who supply the industries and academic researchers working in the area of process analytics cpac continues as the focal point for nessi development and sponsor of the nessi steering team cpac provides a neutral umbrella under which interested companies many of which are competitors in the marketplace have been able to meet discuss needs and issues and make progress towards defining the future of industrial sampling and analyzer systems the nessi name is trademarked by the university of washington to ensure that it remains freely associated with the open nature of the initiative anyone can use the name nessi to refer to products or services that are consistent with the specifications and guidelines of nessi as long as they refrain from exclusively tying the name to a proprietary product or service criticism impact and summaryedit criticism of nessi mechanical systems have included higher initial cost inability to troubleshoot at a component level due to compactintensive spacing and the lack of performance data associated with the use of elastomeric seals in long term installations from a design perspective it may be difficult to design a modular mechanical system which meets the needs of the diverse process applications found in industry development of the nessibus has been an iterative exercise and it will need the close cooperation of both component and analyzer manufacturers to make their equipment nessibus compliant at this time there are missing elements such as a low cost low power flow sensor which is capable of providing a continuous reading of sample system flow as well as a proportional miniature control valve the predicted impact of nessi systems are as follows adoption of a universally accepted method of protection intrinsic safety for sample systems will globalize and harmonize system design and help overcome geographical restrictions currently mandated by various electrical certificationapproval bodies such as factory mutual fm and underwriters laboratories ul atex europe gost russian federation and canadian standards association csa analyzer technical staff will have the capability of accessing the status of all the key indicators of analytical sample system performance both locally and remotely predictive rather than preventive maintenance can be performed and remote diagnostics and graphical user interfaces are the norm analyzer rounds will be eliminated analyzer systems will become more reliable and trustworthy the analyzer technician will have the power to configure a samplinganalytical system as heshe desires using the smart applets the adjustable wrench and screwdriver will be replaced with software molecular management meaning tighter process control by more analysis of the chemical processes  will become feasible with better faster less costly and more abundant analysis this will help reduce manufacturing energy costs and minimize environmental emissions in the process industries since its debut in  nessi the mechanical portion has seen gradual but steady acceptance in industry currently there are three major commercial suppliers of nessi compliant mechanical systems along with dozens of components available for mounting on these systems there is also a growing list of companies implementing nessi systems in their manufacturing and pilotplant facilities recently two of the largest suppliers of process analyzers have committed to supporting nessi hardware and the development of the intrinsically safe nessibus communication into their products nessi is gaining status as a de facto standard for many process sampling system applications nessi acceptance generation i today has spread beyond its initial chemical and petrochemical industry roots to find applications in the automotive food and pharmaceutical industries as well as applications as an analytical development system in research laboratories generation ii electrical systems are now close to commercialization with the first industrial systems scheduled for operation in

 references  external links backgroundedit conventional sample system in an analyzer house ca  modern chemical and petrochemical processing plants are complex systems containing many steps often called unit operations involved in producing one or more products from various raw materials in order to control the many processes for both improved product quality and operational safety many measurements are made at the different stages of processing these measurements either from simple sensors such as temperature pressure flow etc or from sophisticated chemical analyzers providing composition of one or more components in the chemical stream are typically used as inputs to process control algorithms to give a snapshot of the process operation and to control the process to ensure it is operating efficiently and safely traditionally most of the measurements with the exception of temperature pressure and flow were performed offline by taking a sample from the process and analyzing it in the laboratory beginning in the latter of part of the s a trend aimed at moving the analysis from the laboratory to the process plant began with the advent of more sophisticated analyzers this concept known as process analytics become much more prevalent in the s and a new discipline called process analytical chemistry pac emerged which combined chemical engineering and analytical chemistry one of the main driving forces for pac see also a more recent but related development in the pharmaceutical industry called pat is to remove the bottleneck and time lag associated with sending the samples to the lab and waiting for the analysis results by moving the analysis to the process results can be obtained closer to realtime which effectively improves the ability for the control action to correct for process changes ie feedback and feed forward control by far the most common implementation of pac especially for more complex analyzers utilizes what is known as extractive sampling this typically involves the continuous or sometimes periodic removal of a small portion of sample from a much larger piping system or process vessel this sample is then conditioned filtered pressure regulated flow controlled etc and introduced to the analyzer where the chemical composition or the intrinsic physical properties of process fluids vapours and liquids are measured in the industrial plants the majority of sample systems and their related analyzers are installed in analyzer houses the hardware traditionally metal tubing compression fittings valves regulators rotameters and filters associated with extractive sampling is collectively referred to as the sampling system sample systems are used to condition or adjust the sample conditions pressure amount of particulate allowed temperature and flow to a level suitable for use with an analytical device analyzer such as a gas chromatograph an oxygen analyzer or an infra red spectrometer despite the simple

simplify the tasks and reduce the overall costs associated with engineering installing and maintaining chemical process analytical systems process analytical systems are commonly used by the chemical oil refining and petrochemical industries to measure and control both chemical composition as well as certain intrinsic physical properties such as viscosity the specific objectives of nessi are

 references  external links backgroundedit conventional sample system in an analyzer house ca  modern chemical and petrochemical processing plants are complex systems containing many steps often called unit operations involved in producing one or more products from various raw materials in order to control the many processes for both improved product quality and operational safety many measurements are made at the different stages of processing these measurements either from simple sensors such as temperature pressure flow etc or from sophisticated chemical analyzers providing composition of one or more components in the chemical stream are typically used as inputs to process control algorithms to give a snapshot of the process operation and to control the process to ensure it is operating efficiently and safely traditionally most of the measurements with the exception of temperature pressure and flow were performed offline by taking a sample from the process and analyzing it in the laboratory beginning in the latter of part of the s a trend aimed at moving the analysis from the laboratory to the process plant began with the advent of more sophisticated analyzers this concept known as process analytics become much more prevalent in the s and a new discipline called process analytical chemistry pac emerged which combined chemical engineering and analytical chemistry one of the main driving forces for pac see also a more recent but related development in the pharmaceutical industry called pat is to remove the bottleneck and time lag associated with sending the samples to the lab and waiting for the analysis results by moving the analysis to the process results can be obtained closer to realtime which effectively improves the ability for the control action to correct for process changes ie feedback and feed forward control by far the most common implementation of pac especially for more complex analyzers utilizes what is known as extractive sampling this typically involves the continuous or sometimes periodic removal of a small portion of sample from a much larger piping system or process vessel this sample is then conditioned filtered pressure regulated flow controlled etc and introduced to the analyzer where the chemical composition or the intrinsic physical properties of process fluids vapours and liquids are measured in the industrial plants the majority of sample systems and their related analyzers are installed in analyzer houses the hardware traditionally metal tubing compression fittings valves regulators rotameters and filters associated with extractive sampling is collectively referred to as the sampling system sample systems are used to condition or adjust the sample conditions pressure amount of particulate allowed temperature and flow to a level suitable for use with an analytical device analyzer such as a gas chromatograph an oxygen analyzer or an infra red spectrometer despite the simple

the manufacturers the interconnections below the surface are proprietary the following figure shows three of the common designs from left to right a swagelok system which uses various lengths of tube connectors set in rigid channels a circortech design which uses a single block with assorted flowtubes and a parker hannifin design which uses various blocks ported together with small connectors which also serve as flow paths the figure below illustrates the spacing differences between a conventional system and a modular sample system generation ii connectivity using nessibus and the samedit the key elements of the nessi generation ii specification are as follows adoption of a digital communication bus nessibus that is specifically tailored for process analytics and intended to replace  ma systems this bus can handle up to  devices this bus would be equivalent to a plugandplay usb bus on a personal computer but with special requirements for electrical equipment in hazardous areas classifying the interior of an enclosure handling hazardous flammable fluids eg hydrogen and ethylene as division zone  rather than divisionzone  adopting the use of a safe low energy globally accepted method of electrical protection called intrinsic safety for the nessibus adopting the use of miniature smartautomated electronic devices including sensors flow pressure temperature onoff and proportional actuators and enclosure heater controls a move away from the use of local indicating devices such as gauges and rotameters in order to reduce laborintensive manual checking rounds a move away from centralized control automation model to a localfield control model which is represented by a small computing device called the sensor actuator manager sam adopting the concept of portable commercially available software smart applets for the purpose of automating specific sample system functions these applets would be resident in the sam employing an ethernet network between the sam the dcs and the operator  maintenance o  m user station nessi refers to this bus as the anlan introduction of a graphical user interface gui for better visualization of physically compact sampling systems generation ii connectivity model using nessibus and sam the first prototype of a multi nodeminiature generation ii system was demonstrated by siemens process analytics in  siemens has adapted an existing bus system called ic to operate in an intrinsically safe mode this work was undertaken once it was determined that existing intrinsically safe capable digital communication systems such as foundation fieldbus and profibus could not meet the requirements of reduced physical size as well as the lower cost and power draw defined by the nessibus whether or not this bus will go into wide commercial production is unknown at this time an example of a generation  system a nonprofit organization can in automation cia released in  a draft standard proposal dsp that specifies the physical layer of an intrinsically safe bus can  controller area network the specification has been developed by members of the cia organization among them abb pepperlfuchs texas instruments and siemens by using a lower voltage  v for its power supply this bus can provide more current up to  ma to power multiple devices in a hazardous environment this group has standardized upon the pin m pico connector for providing both power and signal to the devices a commercial implementation of a process analytical system using this bus has yet to be demonstrated an interim development called generation  uses both conventional  ma analogue sensors and discrete signals to actuate valves a programmable logic controller plc is used as the sensor actuator manager sam generation iii  microanalyticaledit the introduction of new microanalytical devices to the process industries can be enabled by employing standard physical electrical and software interfaces generation iii will allow tighter integration of the sample conditioning and analytical measurement devices an example of an integrated analytical device oxygen transmitter and sampling system applicationsedit nessi is used for process analytical measurements in the petrochemical chemical and oil refining industries these measurements may be for quality control of raw material or final product environmental compliance safety energy reduction or process control purposes vapour applications may include hydrocarbon feed stocks and intermediates ethylene ethane propylene etc natural gas streams liquefied petroleum gas lpg streams hydrogen and air gas streams liquid systems suitable for use with the generation i mechanical portion of nessi are hydrocarbons such as diesel fuel as well as aqueous streams highly viscous fluids and solids are not suitable for use with nessi very dirty high particulate streams need to be filtered some liquid service applications may be limited by pressure drops associated with components hooked up in a serial configuration nessi systems have found applications in areas other than the process analytical environments including micro reactor mini plant and laboratory environments where small size unskilled assembly and flexible configuration is important role of cpacedit the development of nessi has been a collaborative effort between industrial endusers manufacturers who supply the industries and academic researchers working in the area of process analytics cpac continues as the focal point for nessi development and sponsor of the nessi steering team cpac provides a neutral umbrella under which interested companies many of which are competitors in the marketplace have been able to meet discuss needs and issues and make progress towards defining the future of industrial sampling and analyzer systems the nessi name is trademarked by the university of washington to ensure that it remains freely associated with the open nature of the initiative anyone can use the name nessi to refer to products or services that are consistent with the specifications and guidelines of nessi as long as they refrain from exclusively tying the name to a proprietary product or service criticism impact and summaryedit criticism of nessi mechanical systems have included higher initial cost inability to troubleshoot at a component level due to compactintensive spacing and the lack of performance data associated with the use of elastomeric seals in long term installations from a design perspective it may be difficult to design a modular mechanical system which meets the needs of the diverse process applications found in industry development of the nessibus has been an iterative exercise and it will need the close cooperation of both component and analyzer manufacturers to make their equipment nessibus compliant at this time there are missing elements such as a low cost low power flow sensor which is capable of providing a continuous reading of sample system flow as well as a proportional miniature control valve the predicted impact of nessi systems are as follows adoption of a universally accepted method of protection intrinsic safety for sample systems will globalize and harmonize system design and help overcome geographical restrictions currently mandated by various electrical certificationapproval bodies such as factory mutual fm and underwriters laboratories ul atex europe gost russian federation and canadian standards association csa analyzer technical staff will have the capability of accessing the status of all the key indicators of analytical sample system performance both locally and remotely predictive rather than preventive maintenance can be performed and remote diagnostics and graphical user interfaces are the norm analyzer rounds will be eliminated analyzer systems will become more reliable and trustworthy the analyzer technician will have the power to configure a samplinganalytical system as heshe desires using the smart applets the adjustable wrench and screwdriver will be replaced with software molecular management meaning tighter process control by more analysis of the chemical processes  will become feasible with better faster less costly and more abundant analysis this will help reduce manufacturing energy costs and minimize environmental emissions in the process industries since its debut in  nessi the mechanical portion has seen gradual but steady acceptance in industry currently there are three major commercial suppliers of nessi compliant mechanical systems along with dozens of components available for mounting on these systems there is also a growing list of companies implementing nessi systems in their manufacturing and pilotplant facilities recently two of the largest suppliers of process analyzers have committed to supporting nessi hardware and the development of the intrinsically safe nessibus communication into their products nessi is gaining status as a de facto standard for many process sampling system applications nessi acceptance generation i today has spread beyond its initial chemical and petrochemical industry roots to find applications in the automotive food and pharmaceutical industries as well as applications as an analytical development system in research laboratories generation ii electrical systems are now close to commercialization with the first
