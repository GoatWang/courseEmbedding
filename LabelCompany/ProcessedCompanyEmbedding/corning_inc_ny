installation of cable networks field connectors was a fairly timeconsuming process to ensure the seamless flow of dataforming light each hairthin strand of glass fiber had to be glued into a connector technicians had to tote along portable ovens to heatcure the special epoxy after waiting for the connector to finish curing the technician would clean and polish the components by hand to ensure the pristine surface required for optical transmission on average it took six to eight minutes to terminate a single connector results varied widely based on the skill and experience of the technician as

wasn’t that long ago that fiber to the home ftth was in its infancy there were no mass deployments no customized products and no recommended or common installation procedures while corning had been preparing for ftth deployments for many years we hadn’t yet had the opportunity to work with a customer and realize the vision of taking optical fiber all the way to the end customer that changed when the first major carrier announced its plans to deploy ftth technology with this announcement we got to work handinhand with our customer our goal was to merge our expertise in fiber optics with the customer’s need for a reliable futureready product that could be deployed rapidly to allow for largescale ftth deployments the result the flexnap™ system which uses standard optical fiber cables with network access points preinstalled at customerspecified locations along the length of the cable with this product we were able to bring the lifeenhancing benefits of optical fiber to the customer with deployments several times faster than traditional field installations together with our customer we developed a product that revolutionized ftth delivery and is still an essential element in many ftth
