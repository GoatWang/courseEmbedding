site archive p scott conti president of providence  worcester railroad co worcester sunday jun   at  am since  p scott conti has been president of the providence  worcester railroad company a publicly traded company based in worcester with other headquarters in cumberland ri and plainville conn he began his tenure in  as an engineering manager and worked his way up into other positions such as chief engineer and vice president of engineering by  the providence  worcester railroad company is a shortline freight railroad operating in massachusetts rhode island connecticut and new york its operations involve transportation of a wide variety of commodities for its  customers including iron and steel products processed foods construction materials chemicals plastics and more last year the company transported  carloads of freighthow has the company changed in the last couple of years to grow and adapt to market conditionsthe largest change we made in creating new opportunities is building access to multiple railroads there are seven major class i railroads in north america and the providence  worcester railroad has access to four we connect with csx in worcester with pan am southern and norfolk southern in gardner and canadian pacific at willimantic conn creating those interchanges allowed us to have better opportunities for traffic for our customers it gives them more opportunities to bring freight to new england pw operates on a system of  miles to four states so these connections allow access to our entire operating area another change has been in our employee base the company for many years had employees that started in the s or early s and worked for  or  years in the last four or five years those employees retired and weve hired new people to replace them that dont have the experience or institutional knowledge of the others — but are learning our business and bringing in innovative ideas and new opportunities to grow they are being supervised to meet all the educational requirements and safety requirements of our systempw handles plastics chemicals lumber and a wide range of other products do you see an increase in particular areas and concurrently are there items that you are handling less frequentlyrecently the largest increase weve seen is in moving aggregates and aggregates are mined in connecticut on our property and they are used to create asphalt and concrete and construction materials we haul those to other locations in connecticut as well as new york city theres a large construction market in nyc thats an area where weve seen significant growth areas where weve seen some decline mostly based on the energy market is dealing with coal for years we handled coal shipped into providence loaded on the dock and then moved to power plants in new hampshire and western mass and we connected with pan am southern one coal plant recently announced that its closing this october the other coal plant is on and off line based on the energy demands and the ability of the rate payers to pay so when the gasfired plants dont meet the demands or the pricing has an impact the coal power will make up that demand or become that power demand based on pricinglast year the companys revenues grew by  million or  percent how is that success continuing into  and to what can it be attributedits the aggregates currently thats a market we can serve and having five loading points not so much quarries but sites where they load railcars on our property in connecticut and being able to service the new york market has helped us to grow that commodity group also weve seen intermodal pick up in the last two years and we expect it to continue pw handles international containers they come in from all over the world via rail into worcester and then are distributed into centers from that yard it is a customs bonded facility and it handles the containers — and thats goods ranging from electronics clothing and shoes to other manufactured items thats a customer weve had since  and its different than the domestic containers that are handled our company has a diverse customer base with more than  customers so were very well rounded to be stable during economic changes here in new england but it also gives us the opportunity to grow in different commodity groups and thats a big part of it as wellwhat do you think the publics biggest misconception is about your company and the service it providesthere are a few id say were a large railroad here in worcester and a large landowner we have a mile system and we are highly visible but were not as big as the csx railroad csx is  miles i think when people think of railroads they think they are all quite large and were not nearly as large as some of the bigger class ones the providence  worcester railroad also does not provide passenger service we do have chartered excursion trains from time to time and we work closely with the blackstone valley tourism council and the mass bay rail enthusiasts to operate trains on our system but as far as running passengers from worcester to providence that isnt in place just yet its possibly something that could happen in the future another misconception we dont just operate freight from worcester to providence we service a global market and were connected to the rail network throughout north america and we have multiple interchanges that i mentioned earlier its a big system and were a piece of that— compiled by correspondent susan gonsalves subscribe today choose the plan that’s right for you digital access
