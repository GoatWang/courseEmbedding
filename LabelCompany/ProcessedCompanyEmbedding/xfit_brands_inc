resources our consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business as presented in the consolidated financial statements we incurred a net loss of  during the six months ended december   and losses are expected to continue in the near term the accumulated deficit since inception is  at december   we have been funding our operations through private loans and the sale of equity interests in private placement transactions see our discussion of our credit facility with pimco and our equity purchase agreement with kodiak capital below our cash resources are insufficient to meet our planned business objectives without additional financing the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of our company to continue as a going concern management anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to further develop our product lines and licensing relationships to expand product sales and royalty revenues before significant positive operating cash flows can be achieved our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations at december   we had  of cash on hand we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with our cash from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund operations and expected growth through at least the next twelve months these funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and as a consequence we will need to seek additional funds primarily through the issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business no assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or if available that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us even if we are able to obtain additional financing it may contain undue restrictions on our operations in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stock holders in case of equity financing management has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and beyond these steps include a raising additional capital andor obtaining financing b executing contracts with international licensees and c controlling overhead and expenses there can be no assurance that we can successfully accomplish these steps and it is uncertain that we will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions if at all in the event we are unable to continue as a going concern we may elect or be required to seek protection from our creditors by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy to date management has not considered this alternative nor does management view it as a likely occurrence the success of our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining new customers for our products and new licensees to generate royalty revenues and maintaining a break even or profitable level of operations we have incurred operating losses since inception and this is likely to continue in the near future we believe that we are able to fund our immediate operations working capital requirements and debt service requirements with existing working capital cash flows generated from operations and additional borrowings under our delayed draw note or if available under our equity purchase agreement with ghs our financial requirements will be dependent upon the financial support through credit facilities and additional sales of our equity securities there can be no assurance however that such financing will be available or if it is available that we will be able to structure such financing on terms acceptable to us and that it will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements until we can reach a level of profitable operations and positive cash flows if we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support our operations we may be unable to continue as a going concern we currently have a verbal commitment but no formal written commitments for any additional capital the downturn in the united states stock and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities even if we are able to raise the funds required it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses fail to collect significant amounts owed to us or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing further if we issue additional equity or debt securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our shares of common stock or the debt securities may cause us to be subject to restrictive covenants if additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms we may have to curtail our operations cash total current assets total assets total current liabilities and
