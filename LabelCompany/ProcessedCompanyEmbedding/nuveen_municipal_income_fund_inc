that we can see the majority of the funds are fully invested with a small percentage in cash and cash equivalents source cef connect looking at the top  we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds source nuveen cef website as more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states credits we can see that il represents  of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement source nuveen cef website fortunately we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about  of the portfolio is general obligation funds and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the us government source nuveen cef website taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund we can see that more than  of the funds bond mature more than  years from today there is about  of the fund that matures in  years or less source nuveen cef website the other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio even though more than  of the portfolio is  years out more than  of the portfolios bonds may be called in the next  years or sooner while not likely if interest rates fall municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts source nuveen cef website looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than  of the portfolio is rated a or better only  of the portfolio is unrated even still unrated does not mean poor credit merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically source nuveen cef website looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over  holdings and true to the name none of the holdings are subject to amt tax high income earners will appreciate this further as per nuveen data we can see the average maturity is at  years more important to note i believe is the average effective duration of  years applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of  years what this means is that if we have another  rise in interest rates the underlying portfolios nav should decline about  or  adjusted for the portfolios leverage source nuveen cef website performance update since our last article on june th  the funds share price has fallen  right in line with the duration numbers the total return however is only a loss of  once you account for the distribution the interesting note here is the underlying nav is only down  nea data by ycharts next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income etfs and some muni closed end funds below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments first is the ishares national muni etf mub we further include the ishares core us agg bond index etf agg to

nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the quality name and ended the examined time period down  this is compared to a loss of  for the vaneck muni cef etf a loss of  for the blackrock fund and an outsized  loss for the eaton vance muni bond cef bottom line overall even though municipal closed end funds were hurt nea has held up quite well more importantly looking ahead i would be comfortable holding this fund particularly against funds such as the blackrock municipal bond cef mui which we discussed in our last article as nea has far less general obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as il and nj going forward nea is going to be on my short list for cef investments to replace other funds that are sold due to todays lack of discounts or those trading at

ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
