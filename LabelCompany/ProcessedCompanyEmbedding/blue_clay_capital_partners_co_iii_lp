investment experience ranging from managing blue clay’s alternative and long only portfolios to managing family office assets at okabena  company and hedge fund assets at whitebox advisors much of mr kohler’s career has been focused on the smallcap equity markets covering many business cycles   fundamental investors our investment theses are based on longterm business fundamentals and not the quarter through fundamental valuation analysis we discover companies where the markets have mispriced underlying returns on capital cash flows or growth opportunities we apply our fundamental approach to the small and midcap universe where we find greater market inefficiencies and more undiscovered opportunities   focus on capital preservation we seek to generate equity returns while at the same time preserving capital a focus on capital preservation drives portfolio construction and individual position decisions blue clay utilizes a diversified portfolio construction to manage overall direction and net exposures with conservative application of leverage         blue clay capital partners co iii lp  pooled investment fund blue clay capital management llc formdscom  sec filings of
