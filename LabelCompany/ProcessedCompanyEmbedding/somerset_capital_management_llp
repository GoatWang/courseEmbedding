not a guide to future performance the value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise where an investment involves foreign currency it may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates investors may not get back the amount originally invested the following is a summary of only some of the risk factors which may apply to an investment in a product or a segregated account managed by scm collectively an “account” investment and trading risk all investments risk the loss of capital investing in emerging markets the account will invest primarily in securities traded outside of the united states which entail risks typically not associated with investing in us securities or property such as less publicly available information accounting auditing and financial reporting standards not comparable to those of us companies limited volume in securities markets more volatile prices slower settlement less extensive regulation and additional costs concentration of investments the investment adviser may hold few and relatively large securities positions in relation to the account’s capital that could result in a loss that materially reduces the account’s capital equity securities the prices of these may be affected by general economic and market conditions such as a broad decline in stock market prices or by conditions affecting specific issuers such as changes in earnings forecasts small and midcap securities the account invests in such securities the stock prices of which can be highly volatile these companies may experience higher rates of bankruptcy or other failures than larger companies and they may be more likely to be negatively affected by changes in management fixed income securities the account will invest in fixed income securities which may be below “investment grade” and face adverse business financial or economic conditions that could lead to the issuer’s inability to meet timely interest and principal payments companies that issue such securities often are highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing a major economic recession could severely disrupt the market for such securities and it is likely that any such economic downturn could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of such securities to repay principal and pay interest thereon and increase the incidence of default for such securities convertible instruments if a convertible instrument held by the account is called for redemption the account will be required to permit the issuer to redeem the instrument or convert it into the underlying stock and will hold the stock to the extent the investment adviser determines that such equity investment is consistent with the investment objective of the account currencies the account will invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the currency in which the account is valued and therefore the value of the account’s assets will fluctuate with us dollar exchange rates as well as with price changes of the account’s investments in the various local markets and currencies illiquid assets certain investment positions of the account may become illiquid and such investments may require a significant amount of time from the date of initial investment before disposition limited liquidity an investment in the account is not freely transferable and withdrawals are generally permitted only at certain periods upon prior written notice valuation risks certain securities held by the account may be difficult to value and third party pricing information for the account’s securities or other investments may not always be available absence of regulatory oversight the account does not intend to register under the investment company act of  as amended the “investment company act” and interests in the account are not registered under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” imposition of tax regardless of cash distributions the account may generate taxable income for a member even though the value of the member’s interest in the account has declined a member may have to use personal funds to pay the income tax owed on the income or gain allocated to the member brokerage the investment adviser need not seek the lowest available commission cost and may cause commissions to be paid to a broker that pays for research or other services at a higher price than that which might be charged by another broker or dealer for effecting the same transaction inkind distributions members may receive inkind distributions of securities or obligations in the account’s portfolio which may not be readily marketable or saleable conflicts of interest the investment adviser may from time to time face conflicts of interest relating to its dealings with the account the foregoing summary list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved in an

foregoing summary list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved in an investment in the account prospective investors consult with their own legal tax and financial advisers before deciding to invest in an account accept dilution levy to our clients our authorised corporate director “acd” maitland institutional services ltd applied a dilution levy across our ucits oeic funds from monday rd june  the dilution levy is a charge in favour of fund holders to compensate for dilution costs ‘dilution’ costs are the costs of dealing including spreads fx stamp duty and broker costs etc when clients purchase or redeem investments which therefore reduce or ‘dilute’ the value of the fund these costs can be small but are compounded over time when charged to the fund and therefore act as a drag on unit holder performance there are a number of ways to account for these costs they can either a be charged to the fund and therefore to existing investors who have not created these costs diluting the nav of fund units or b be charged directly to the buyers or sellers who have generated the costs the intention is that longterm investors in the fund are not penalised for other investor’s daily trading costs this is levied by the acd and somerset retains none of the levy it is paid directly into the fund  of our uk ucits funds  what is “dilution” dilution refers to the effect that investors have on a fund when they purchase or redeem units of a fund when fund units are created or redeemed the value of the fund is reduced because the fund incurs transaction costs in order to create or redeem a unit the costs incurred include but are not limited to broker dealing fees to purchase or sell shares foreign exchange dealing costs the spread between the bid and ask price of the underlying securities which is not reflected in the price of an open ended investment company priced with a single price and stamp duty reserve tax sdrt or equivalent charge levied in foreign markets when these costs are spread across the existing investors of the fund who did not participate in the purchase or redemption of units dilution occurs the unit nav of the fund will be reduced as a result of the costs dilution is therefore a cost borne by existing investors created by entrance and exit of other investors if this sounds unfair please read on to point  because the cost of dilution is all related to the cost of share dealing dilution costs are generally higher for emerging markets funds where broker fees and related dealing costs are generally higher  what is a dilution levy a dilution levy is collected by the acd fund administrator to cover the dilution costs it is collected from entering or exiting investors of the fund so that dilution does not occur up until this change on rd june for somerset funds although there are dealing costs for all purchases or redemptions the acd only charges a levy to compensate for this cost when deals on a specific day account for over  of the fund’s nav this is despite the fact that smaller transactions also incur dealing costs all investments need to be converted into the local currencies of the additional stock purchased a broker will need to be used and there will always be spread costs  why am i being charged another fee a dilution levy is not a “fee” it is not a charge levied by a fund manager from its clients it is a charge that is paid into the fund to the fund holders the costs which this fee offsets were in reality already being paid by the fund by current investors in the fund  is this an entry or exit fee by another name no a dilution levy is not an entry fee or an exit fee an entry or exit fee is a fee charged by the manager of a fund fund investors would pay an exit fee directly to a management company somerset does not charge exit fees on any of its funds a dilution levy is charged by the fund fund investors pay this fee to the fund to other fund unit holders the levy directly benefits unit holders it does not benefit the management company  if it is only a small amount why can the fund not bear the costs these costs are small but are compounded over time when charged to the fund and can therefore be a drag on performance in addition and perhaps more importantly we believe it is fair to charge these costs to the buyers and sellers of fund units who have created them rather than penalise holders of the fund who have not created the additional costs  who is it paid to this is collected by the acd and somerset retains none of the levy it is paid directly into the fund  what do other firms do firms choose to charge this fee in a number of different ways in some cases dual pricing bidoffer or swing pricing is used this should have the same result but uses a different mechanism to ensure funds do not bear these trading costs in other cases only larger transactions are charged dilution this was formerly our approach the reason for our change is motivated by our focus on fairness as referred to in question  and  this is a fairer approach because it takes into account the fixed costs of smaller transactions some firms charge no dilution levy at all and this cost is therefore borne by investors in the fund the key point here is if you invest in a fund which does not charge dilution you will be subsidising other investor’s trading costs for as long as you hold the fund  who sets the levy the dilution levy is set and calculated by the acd based on the  main costs referred to above spread broker and fx costs as well as any other cost the acd considers appropriate this levy is higher for the small cap fund than the large cap fund because small cap stocks are generally less liquid and therefore the spread and broker costs for these stocks are consequently higher  how much is it the dilution levy for the global em large cap fund will be bps for the em dividend growth fund it will be bps and for the small cap fund this will be bps  will the levy be reviewed yes it is possible that the dilution levy could change in the future as it is based on the dilution costs if for example these costs fell the acd would be able to pass this reduction in costs on to new investors through lower dilution levies the levy will be reviewed by phoenix fund services the acd on an annual basis  why is it better in the long run it is better for the unit holders in the long run because they do not have to subsidise the trading costs of other investors coming into or going out of the fund  why is somerset doing this this is being applied by the acd and not somerset however the reason for the alteration to the current practice is due to a desire to make the current system fairer in repatriating the costs of trading back to the creators of these costs it is an extension of the current practice of charging a dilution levy on large inflows or outflows because every transaction creates costs for the fund  why is it applied to inflows and outflows it is only right that it is applied to both because both transactions create dilution costs     th may    dear investor the decision to introduce the dilution levy on all inflows and outflows to our oeics has been taken after considerable discussion with our fund managers clients the acd and other stakeholders this has not been arrived at in a hurried fashion or with the intention of trying to make life in any way more difficult for our investors we are well aware that this represents a change for many of our unit holders and we sincerely hope that you will see this as the most effective way to fairly distribute transaction costs please do not hesitate to contact me oliver crawley louise parsons our acd or any member of our team should you wish to discuss any aspect of these changes we trust that over time our move will be seen as both forwardthinking and ultimately industry best practice as other firms conform to this standard we hope this demonstrates our endeavour to focus on fairness clarity and putting consumers first and we thank you for participating in these changes with us dominic johnson

investment involves foreign currency it may be subject to fluctuations in value due to movements in exchange rates investors may not get back the amount originally invested the following is a summary of only some of the risk factors which may apply to an investment in a product or a segregated account managed by scm collectively an “account” investment and trading risk all investments risk the loss of capital investing in emerging markets the account will invest primarily in securities traded outside of the united states which entail risks typically not associated with investing in us securities or property such as less publicly available information accounting auditing and financial reporting standards not comparable to those of us companies limited volume in securities markets more volatile prices slower settlement less extensive regulation and additional costs concentration of investments the investment adviser may hold few and relatively large securities positions in relation to the account’s capital that could result in a loss that materially reduces the account’s capital equity securities the prices of these may be affected by general economic and market conditions such as a broad decline in stock market prices or by conditions affecting specific issuers such as changes in earnings forecasts small and midcap securities the account invests in such securities the stock prices of which can be highly volatile these companies may experience higher rates of bankruptcy or other failures than larger companies and they may be more likely to be negatively affected by changes in management fixed income securities the account will invest in fixed income securities which may be below “investment grade” and face adverse business financial or economic conditions that could lead to the issuer’s inability to meet timely interest and principal payments companies that issue such securities often are highly leveraged and may not have available to them more traditional methods of financing a major economic recession could severely disrupt the market for such securities and it is likely that any such economic downturn could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of such securities to repay principal and pay interest thereon and increase the incidence of default for such securities convertible instruments if a convertible instrument held by the account is called for redemption the account will be required to permit the issuer to redeem the instrument or convert it into the underlying stock and will hold the stock to the extent the investment adviser determines that such equity investment is consistent with the investment objective of the account currencies the account will invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the currency in which the account is valued and therefore the value of the account’s assets will fluctuate with us dollar exchange rates as well as with price changes of the account’s investments in the various local markets and currencies illiquid assets certain investment positions of the account may become illiquid and such investments may require a significant amount of time from the date of initial investment before disposition limited liquidity an investment in the account is not freely transferable and withdrawals are generally permitted only at certain periods upon prior written notice valuation risks certain securities held by the account may be difficult to value and third party pricing information for the account’s securities or other investments may not always be available absence of regulatory oversight the account does not intend to register under the investment company act of  as amended the “investment company act” and interests in the account are not registered under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” imposition of tax regardless of cash distributions the account may generate taxable income for a member even though the value of the member’s interest in the account has declined a member may have to use personal funds to pay the income tax owed on the income or gain allocated to the member brokerage the investment adviser need not seek the lowest available commission cost and may cause commissions to be paid to a broker that pays for research or other services at a higher price than that which might be charged by another broker or dealer for effecting the same transaction inkind distributions members may receive inkind distributions of securities or obligations in the account’s portfolio which may not be readily marketable or saleable conflicts of interest the investment adviser may from time to time face conflicts of interest relating to its dealings with the account the foregoing summary list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved in an investment in the account prospective investors consult with their own legal tax and financial advisers before deciding to invest in an account accept frontier george birch reynardson we launched the somerset frontier markets product on nd december  there is currently around m of remaining
