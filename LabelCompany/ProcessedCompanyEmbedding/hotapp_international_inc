financial statements   note  the company history and nature of the business   hotapp international inc formerly fragmented industry exchange inc the “company” or “group” was incorporated in the state of delaware on march   and established a fiscal year end of december  the company’s initial business plan was to be a financial acquisition intermediary which would serve buyers and sellers for companies that are in highly fragmented industries the company determined it was in the best interest of the shareholders to expand its business plan on october   through a sale and purchase agreement

statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable for a going concern which assumes that the company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business since inception the company has incurred net losses of  and has net working capital deficit of  at march   management has concluded that due to the conditions described above there is substantial doubt about the entities ability to continue as a going concern through may   we have evaluated the significance of the conditions in relation to our ability to meet our obligations and believe that our current cash balance along with our current operations will not provide sufficient capital to continue operation through  our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving sales growth management of operating expenses and ability of the company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due and upon profitable operations   our majority shareholder has advised us not to depend solely on it for financing we have increased our efforts to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings from other sources    however we cannot be certain that such capital from our shareholders or third parties will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to us   any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that would negatively impact our business  if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms we will have insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth   these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty   note  summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the condensed consolidated balance sheet at december   was derived from audited financial statement but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the other information in these

of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise these condensed financial statements including notes have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the securities and exchange commission and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for complete financial statements these

basis of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements of the group include the financial statements of hotapp international inc and its subsidiaries  all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues cost and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes significant accounting estimates reflected in the group’s consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition the useful lives and impairment of property and equipment valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and sharebased compensation   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments which are unrestricted from withdrawal or use or which have original maturities of three months or less when purchased   foreign currency risk   because of its foreign operations the company holds cash in nonus dollars   as of march   cash and cash equivalents of the group includes on an as converted basis to us dollars   and  in hong kong dollars “hk” reminbi “rmb” and singapore dollars “s” respectively   the renminbi “rmb” is not a freely convertible currency   the state administration for foreign exchange under the authority of the people’s bank of china controls the conversion of rmb into foreign currencies the value of the rmb is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the china foreign exchange trading system market   concentration of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially expose the group to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  the group places their cash with financial institutions with highcredit ratings and quality   fixed assets net   property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis over the following estimated useful lives   office equipment  years computer equipment  years furniture and fixtures  years motor vehicles  years   fair value   fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the group considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability   revenue recognition   the group recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured the group currently has  revenue from its services rendered on projects and plans to derive its revenue from membership subscription services offering the platform for enterprise collaboration

of the relevant tax authorities  deferred income taxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is morelikelythannot that a portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and noncurrent based on their characteristics   the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return is recognized at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a  likelihood of being sustained  interest and penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes the group did not recognize any income tax due to uncertain tax position or incur any interest and penalties related to potential underpaid income tax expenses for the years ended december   or  respectively   uncertainties exist with respect to the application of the new eit law to our operations specifically with respect to our tax residency  the new eit law specifies that legal entities organized outside of the prc will be considered residents for prc income tax purposes if their “de facto management bodies” as “establishments that carry on substantial and overall management and control over the operations personnel accounting properties etc of the company”  because of the uncertainties that have resulted from limited prc guidance on the issue it is uncertain whether our legal entities outside the prc constitute residents under the new eit law  if one or more of our legal entities organized outside the prc were characterized as prc residents the impact would adversely affect our results of operations   foreign currency translation   the functional and reporting currency of the company is the united states dollar “us dollar” the financial records of the company’s subsidiaries located in singapore hong kong and the prc are maintained in their local currencies the singapore dollar s hong kong dollar hk and renminbi rmb which are also the functional currencies of these entities   monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency

minimum lease commitments of  from  to    we will need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings however we cannot be certain that such capital from sed or third party will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on a term that is acceptable to us any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing shareholders and could result in significant financial and operating covenants that would negatively impact our business if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms we will have insufficient funds to operate our business and pursue our business plan   consistent with section  of delaware general corporation law it is our current policy that all transactions between us and our officers directors and their affiliates will be entered into only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors are approved by vote of the stockholders or are fair to us as corporation as of the time it is authorized approved or ratified by the board we will conduct an appropriate review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis   critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves and income taxes these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date   within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported   revenue recognition   the group recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured the group currently has  revenue from its services rendered on projects and plans to derive its revenue from membership subscription services offering the platform for enterprise collaboration with integration revenue is currently recognized under contract accounting due to the significant software production required and the percentageofcompletion method is used in accordance with asc  the company is recognizing the percentageofcompletion based on input measures that measured directly from expenses incurred and management reviews the progress to completion   research and development expenses   research and development expenses primarily consist of i salaries and benefits for research and development personnel and ii office rental general expenses and depreciation expenses associated with the research and development activities  the company’s research and development activities primarily consist of the research and development of new features for its mobile platform and its selfdeveloped mobile games expenditures incurred during the research phase are expensed as incurred   income taxes   current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities  deferred income taxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is morelikelythannot that a portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and noncurrent based on their characteristics          uncertainties exist with respect to the application of the new eit law to our operations specifically with respect to our tax residency  the new eit law specifies that legal entities organized outside of the prc will be considered residents for prc income tax purposes if their “de facto management bodies” as “establishments that carry on substantial and overall management and control over the operations personnel accounting properties etc of the company”  because of the uncertainties resulted from limited prc guidance on the issue it is uncertain whether our legal entities outside the prc constitute residents under the new eit law  if one or more of our legal entities organized outside the prc were characterized as prc residents the impact would adversely affect our results of operations   item     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable to a “smaller reporting company” as

be extended or satisfied in other ways and the professional service providers insist upon payment absent the above our officers and directors will attempt to seek sufficient funding personally for the amounts due and if successful in obtaining these funds to lend it to the company on an interestfree basis no formal written arrangement exists with respect to our founder president and chief executive officer or anyone’s commitment outside of the company to loan funds for this purpose our current legal counsel has agreed to defer payment of a portion of its fees until commencement of the offering our plans will not change regardless of whether any proceeds are raised online matching services technology or ma portals there are currently a large number of privately owned websites providing business merger  acquisition services such sites include wwwrainmakercom wwwbusinessforsaleexchangecom wwwbuysellaustincom however we know of no such publicly traded companies parallels can be drawn between online dating sites and our emerging online deal sourcing technologies the online dating industry is dominated by several large corporations and wellknown websites such companies include match and affiliated sites plentoffish spark networks eharmony mate to be successful we believe new entrants must have a differentiated offering we believe new companies are challenged to recruit new users when they do not already have a substantial pool of existing users as a result marketing costs for new firms are disproportionately high there is no assurance that we can produce sufficient revenue to cover our expenses including such marketing costs and as such an investor may lose all their investment however management believes that competitive advantages for our business plan will include  industry specific matching and business services  ease of searching and matching of buyers and sellers through our tobecompleted algorithm  the expected interactive nature of our site provided by discussion forums  the proposed proactive sending of information to users who register with our website to encourage repeat visits to our site  our plans for providing supporting executive level consulting and backoffice services we continue to review and collect information on existing web sites that provide business merger and acquisition we have compiled a list of features that these web sites offer and intend to present the market with a comprehensive and user friendly website that provides more information more current data a larger set of features and a more user friendly interface than the majority of the existing sites such features may include but not be limited to benchmarking surveys job search links management expects to invest in ongoing development of the algorithm maintenance and expansion of the first industry exchange in order to remain competitive but believes the primary revenues will be driven by the success of our business service the scope of the ongoing development of the algorithm will be determined by the revenue generated and potentially by future financing opportunities the professional business services consulting industry competition in the professional consulting services markets in which we operate is highly fragmented consisting of several large global firms including mckinsey  co the boston consulting group deloitte consulting llp pricewaterhousecoopers llp and several thousand smaller firms we may compete with both the large firms and the smaller firms in all areas of our service offerings the markets for the company’s services and products are highly competitive there are few barriers to entry so new entrants occur frequently resulting in considerable market fragmentation companies in this industry compete on a number of parameters including degree and quality of consultants position knowledge industry expertise service quality and efficiency in completing assignments typically companies with greater strength in these parameters garner higher margins company description fragmented industry exchange inc formerly known as ontarget staffing inc was incorporated in the state of delaware as a forprofit company on march   and established a fiscal year end of december  we are a developmentstage financial acquisition intermediary which will serve buyers and sellers for companies that are in highly fragmented industries ie industries in which there is no clear leader in market share we plan to do this by developing a secure online merger and acquisition ma platform that matches buyers and sellers in specific industries “industry exchanges” and provide consulting and back office support services the industry exchanges will use a proprietary search algorithm if completed to automatically assess business buyers’ and sellers’ profiles then match only relevant counterparties the “algorithm” we are currently in discussion with an outside third party developer who will be used to complete our algorithm once finalized the contract will include an arrangement with an independent contractor to perform all work needed to complete the project as of the date of this prospectus the development contract has not been signed development of the algorithm will commence once sufficient funds are available to provide a  down payment for the development contract currently we anticipate requiring  to fund development of the algorithm we expect to have an initial algorithm completed by the th quarter of  until we complete our algorithm we will use microsoft excel to track buyers and sellers and related profiles the matching process will be done manually based upon the review of excel information certain factors used to match counterparties include geographic location of the business size of business revenues cash flow of business asking price and availability of seller financing buyers and sellers’ responses for these and other factors will be input into excel spreadsheet and a manual comparison will conducted to determine whether any potential matches between buyers and sellers exist based on the criteria established upon determination of any matches sellers are informed of potential buyers upon seller confirmation of interest in a potential buyer we provide the contact information for such buyer we are not involved in any transaction between the counterparties we believe that by providing our industryspecific business services we can drive more revenue and expand our relationship with the industry exchange members whether a member consummates an ma transaction with a counterparty member from the industry exchange or not members might use our business services as part of their existing business initially our business services will include assistance with i revenue generation more specifically online marketing and ii expense efficiencies more specifically accounting and financial support insurance planning and human resource advisory furthermore our business services will be marketed through a separate web portal from our industry exchanges we believe that approach may allow us to attract other clients that are not actual members of the industry exchange until we generate enough revenue or raise additional capital our ceo will deliver our business services as of the date of this prospectus we have no business services clients we intend to market these business services to companies in each of the industry specific sections for example we have already compiled a list of  us based staffing companies “target customers’ with information that includes company’s name estimated sales  of employees phone fax contact at firm title and address we intend to market through a combination of methods including internet campaigns searchengine optimization and direct marketing campaigns the first industry exchange we have developed is for the staffing industry and have launched our two first industryspecific portal sites  wwwstaffingbizbuysellcom and wwwstaffingbizvaluecom the “websites” for the staffing industry we currently have  seller members listed on this first exchange which is branded on the website as the “staffing exchange” the “staffing exchange” is not a separate corporate entity—rather it identifies the name of the specific industry exchange our first business portal site is branded on the web site as “ontarget” which is not a separate corporate entity we are not currently providing business services for any of these clients as we do not have any current “buyer” members we have only provided listing services for these members other fragmented industries for which we may develop similar exchanges and websites include insurance golf hair and nail salons and plastics we will create branded websites for each industry exchange created each industry exchange will also offer an industry forum where users can discuss their industry experiences and business best practices over time we believe we can accumulate a significant knowledge base of industry information and develop and distribute proprietary content “industry research” should revenues increase andor financing be available we may develop our own industry research group no timeline or specific business plan has been developed to deliver industry research however we expect to be performing such work by the st calendar quarter of  the industry research may be offered on a free basis for general information or as a subscription service for more detailed information and access to research specialists we also intend to offer discussion forums where users of our website can exchange feedback tips social networking advice and ideas users will be required to register and provide their business name activity mailing and email address in order to be able to participate in our discussion forums we may also offer incentives to encourage users to provide us with more detailed business information like revenue number of employees and advertising spending we may offer users the option to opt into promotional emails which we would then be able to send on a targeted basis on behalf of advertisers in order to increase our revenue opportunities  we were incorporated in the state of delaware in march  as ontarget staffing inc which name was changed to fragmented industry exchange inc in august  our principal office
