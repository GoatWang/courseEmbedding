management team are also on hand to help answer your questions our comments today will include forwardlooking statements regarding our future expectations which may differ significantly from actual results information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our sec filings we will refer to certain nongaap financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable gaap and nongaap measures in our earnings release this morning alaska air group reported a record quarterly adjusted profit of  million or  per diluted share this result compares to the first call consensus of  per share and exceeds last years adjusted net income of  million or  per diluted share additional information about cost expectations capacity plans fuel hedging capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our form k filed this morning and is available on our website at alaskaaircom and now ill turn the call over to brad bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thanks lavanya and good morning everyone as lavanya mentioned we reported a net profit of  million for the second quarter which is  higher than  months ago this is our th consecutive quarter of profitability and is the highest quarterly profit in our history the  growth in our net profit coupled with the repurchase of  million shares over the last  months drove our earnings per share up by  to  per share as we pause to take a look at how were doing midyear and twoandahalf years into the biggest competitive incursion weve seen in a while im happy to share that we are thriving our operation is firing on all cylinders our leaders are focused on execution and we are generating returns that far exceed our cost of capital but before i talk about the returns i want to spend a few minutes on the underlying drivers of our results ill start with safety our number one priority is to operate safely and we think that doing so benefits our overall operation because to be safe we have to all understand our jobs and we have to have the tools and training to do them well and this focus on doing things right has benefits that extend throughout our airline our commitment to operating safely was recently validated by our maintenance team earning the faas amt diamond award for maintenance training and excellence this is the th consecutive diamond award for alaska airlines horizon air has also won the award  times turning to our operation we continued to operate well despite some headwinds as you know were growing significantly to strengthen and fortify our franchise in seattle and we crossed the flightperday threshold on july  the increased flying coupled with runway closures in seattle la and juneau created a challenging operational environment this spring and summer but our people moved quickly our system ops team adjusted block and ground times and implemented a dualtaxiway in our seattle hub which allows us to taxi two planes side by side in opposite directions and our operations team executed the plan really well  of our flights arrived on time and we cancelled only onehalf of  of our flights we expect that both of these statistics will lead the seven largest domestic airlines many of whom are running their own great operations our people are delivering on our promise of a safe reliable and ontime operation and ben dave and i and the rest of the leadership team could not be more proud of them on the customer service front our internal customer satisfaction score for the quarter tied our score from the first quarter of  which was the highest score weve seen since we began tracking this data in  as you know we also won our eighth consecutive jd power award for customer service during the quarter were pleased that the enhancements to our product and service are resonating with customers but we have more work to do the onboard experience is an area where weve made a lot of changes and we have more plan for example weve introduced a new inflight entertainment system weve improved the meals in both cabins and weve given our flight attendants mobile devices which facilitate greater personalization in their interaction with customers in may we introduced preferred seating which gives passengers additional legroom early boarding and a free drink were very interested in seeing how this product is received as it could lead to more opportunity down the road with respect to our schedule earlier this month we launched new service from seattle to both milwaukee and oklahoma city and from portland to st louis with all of these being served with a new aircraft type the embraer e the early returns on these markets are very good were looking forward to new service this fall to jfk raleigh charleston nashville and costa rica and finally recognizing that the customer preference and financial success that we have today is due in part to our superior service were doubling down on service through a new series of workshops for our customerfacing employees ben is going to tell you a bit more about these in a moment we expect that each of these changes is going to improve the experience for our customers and help us increase the preference they have for alaska moving to financials i felt that we had good performance this quarter our pretax margin of  is  basis points higher than last year this is our best quarterly performance ever and we expect our margin performance to be near the top of the industry and to exceed the sp  companies on average of course a lot of the improvement is due to lower fuel prices but we also had relatively strong revenue performance and strong cost performance the fact that we were able to take the majority of the lower fuel prices to the bottom line is a testament to the focus and diligence of our leadership team our roic of  over the last  months far exceeds our cost of capital and speaks to a business that has created tremendous value for its owners and to give you a sense for how things are moving our pretax income for the first six months of  was  million which is about equal to what we earned for all of  more broadly we expect this to be a record quarter for the industry and an indication that the industry is healthy and focused on earning returns that exceeds its cost of capital while fuel is low and economy is generally strong we believe that this is still a cyclical business being flexible is important for producing strong results throughout the cycle alaska is the only us airline that has net interest income and this combined with the  aircraft that we own free and clear gives us great flexibility should we see fluctuations in fuel prices or a downturn in the economy this increased flexibility has allowed us to be profitable through the worst recession since the great depression and to perform strongly in the midst of unprecedented competition but most importantly our people have proven themselves to be resourceful and resilient we have said for some time now that competition should make us better but as i see these results talk with our customers and see our employees out in the operation im convinced that we are a better and stronger company today than we were three years ago and our leadership team is heads down and focused on the future focused on executing our plan to keep alaska strong and prosperous over the long run and creating value for our employees our customers our communities and very importantly our shareholders the program for customerfacing employees which i mentioned earlier is one step in that direction and i want to turn the call over now to ben to provide some detail on this benito minicucci  chief operating officer and executive vice president operations alaska airlines inc thanks brad and good morning everyone at alaska we know that a lowcost structure is fundamental to our longterm financial success and we also believe that our success has been fueled by our rich history and culture of customer service that has been a cornerstone of our sustainability this year despite winning an eighth jd power award we challenged ourselves to up our game in the area of customer service we created what we call the beyond service workshop that all  customerfacing employees and their leadership teams will attend throughout  this experience conducted over oneandahalf days is being held in a really unique venue in south seattle thats designed to celebrate our rich history and roots of customer service dna educate our employees on the competitive landscape share the essence of our brand with them and present our service framework built on safety caring delivery and presentation this framework is designed to engage empower and align everyone at air group in an effort to create a consistent approach to service that results in exceptional customer experience the workshop is very intimate handson and twoway dialogue facilitated primarily by frontline employees like flight attendants customer service agents and reservation agents they review reallife examples on how to deliver exemplary service in various and sometimes challenging scenarios the big takeaway learnings are empowerment knowing when to make exceptions to policies and enhancing the trust between management and frontline employees this investment in our people will help us create additional separation from our competitors and confirm our place on the list of bestinclass service providers we believe that beyond service when combined with our operational excellence creates a compelling proposition for our customers and strengthens our brand preference and now over to andrew andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer thanks ben and good morning everybody our second quarter passenger revenue increased  million or  on  capacity growth our second quarter prasm was down  as a result of the  increase in capacity in our markets but notwithstanding this our prasm gap to the industry narrowed by  basis points to  in fact our june prasm was  better than the industry despite our capacity growth of  as you know we are growing and as we grow we are focused on diversifying our revenue streams and growing our customer base i want to take a few moments to provide you with some details under each of these areas ill start off with diversifying revenue streams first we launched  new markets since the beginning of q of  almost  of these markets are profitable within their first year of operation and additionally half of these markets would be profitable if fuel were  a gallon we expect all new markets to continue to improve as they mature secondly well be relaunching  new markets in the second half of  all of this growth is undergirded by tremendous customer loyalty continued cost discipline and matching the right aircraft to the right market for example we are very pleased to introduce new embraer s to the fleet earlier this month this will be a great airplane for us and allow us to serve long thin markets profitably by late  well have over  es in the network all of which will be operated by our cpa partner skywest third we introduced a new revenue stream through the preferred seating this quarter and we are very encouraged to see the highest uptake was on actual shorter stage lengths which have the highest passenger volumes we will continue to make revenueenhancing adjustments to this program over time as we learn more about customer behavior and preference and lastly weve been very pleased with our first class revenue performance upgrade sales at the gate increased  and our p class or discounted first class fares helped boost our paid first class load factor by  points to  in q our paid first class prasm was down only  significantly better than our system prasm performance moving to the second theme growing our customer base we continue to focus on customers with our industryleading ontime performance improvements to our onboard product and everexpanding network our customers are rewarding our efforts with greater loyalty our loyalty program generated  million in cash for q thats an increase of  our active mileage plan members were up  and we grew our card program by  both programs continue to outpace our passenger growth our customers increasingly book with us through alaskaaircom which is both our lowest cost and highest engagement channel so far this year sales through alaskaaircom are up  points to  and both web and mobile checkin are up five points each when speaking of customer loyalty partnerships are key and yesterday we announced a new mileage plan partnership with hainan airways hainan offers a premium experience and flies nonstop to beijing and shanghai from seattle and nearly  destinations throughout china alaskas network provides powerful feed to our international partners allowing them to grow and in turn open up more options for our customers for example our feed just to emirates has doubled in the last two years to  passengers a day allowing emirates to add a second frequency in seattle in fact since their second frequency add daily passengers jumped to  during july with a peak day of  connecting passengers hainan and icelandair both carriers we work with as either a partner or through interline have also increased their international capacity in seattle ensuring that our customers have better options for their international travel needs creating greater customer affinity and diversifying our revenue base will help us to become successful in the long term our seattle market share for the last  months ended december   given current booking schedules of  is unchanged from  months ending december  proof that the changes we have made to our network are working well in the midst of increased competition as we shift our focus to the back half of the year alaskas capacity will be up  in q and  in q stage gauge and new markets will contribute three points to the third quarter and eight points in the fourth quarter the remainder is growth in our strong core markets to help us increase our utility we freed up five aircrafts in the fourth quarter by reducing day of week and frequency flying in markets where supply and demand were not aligned well use these assets to accelerate the launch of new markets as we move into q we do have a few things to be mindful of first weighted capacity in our hawaii and alaska markets is expected to be up  and  respectively yield pressure in q was most acute in these two regions and will continue into q and second while the rate of competitive capacity increase is trending down it remains high at  points of growth in q and eight points of growth in q driven by new competitive adds to markets such as pasco missoula kona and orlando in summary were growing and diversifying revenues and at the same time generating increased customer loyalty which includes strong growth in our credit card program we have confidence in the resilience of our business model and we expect our positive momentum to continue and with that ill turn this over to brandon brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance hey thanks andrew and good morning everybody as brad said air groups adjusted net profit improved by  and earnings per share improved by  on an adjusted pretax basis we earned  million nearly  million more than last years second quarter most of the profit increase was because of more lower fuel prices still revenues grew by  million outpacing the  million increase in nonfuel costs we had an exceptional nonfuel cost performance this quarter with casmex down  on the  increase in capacity we benefited from a large credit from one of our maintenance providers that accounted for much of the decline in casmex from our early q guidance but even without that costs would have come down nicely as my good friend our coo ben minicucci likes to say good cost performance isnt a finance thing its because of the great things happening out in the business and i couldnt agree more in that vein id like to share an example with you in the last contract with our flight attendants we introduced a new concept we called a productivity premium which allows our flight attendants to earn up to  a year for exceeding their monthly line average each quarter this new provision has played an important role in our sick time declining by about  yearoveryear thats a great outcome and kudos to our flight attendants and inflight leadership for making it work looking forward we expect exfuel costs to be up about  in the third quarter and down about  in the fourth let me quickly touch on the drivers of the q increase first weve got tough comps in the wages and benefits line because we recorded several favorable benefits adjustments last year we also got a bit ahead of ourselves with hiring this spring and it impacted our productivity numbers in the second quarter and it will have an impact on q as well were working to fix that now so that were in better shape going into the fall shoulder season second were expecting maintenance to jump to its highest level of the year last years numbers also included a favorable settlement with a maintenance vendor and finally q has the least capacity growth of any quarter this year so we dont get as much leverage in the denominator were still planning for a unit cost decline of about  for the full year consistent with our earlier guidance and our longstanding track record of unit cost reduction even though we had an outstanding second quarter were now expecting higher incentive pay reflecting our great performance against safety cost customer and profit targets which is actually a good thing continued investments in improving our onboard food and beverage product for our customers and much higher property tax expenses in the second half of the year quickly touching on fuel our economic fuel cost per gallon was  down  but more importantly our fuel burn on an asm per gallon basis improved by another  or  so far this year cash flow from operations in the first half of the year was  million onbalance sheet debt is now  million and even when factoring leases our investmentgrade balance sheet has no net debt i believe were the only carrier to have net interest income on our pl this creates an important cost advantage that drives more profit to the bottom line trailing month aftertax roic stands at  almost  basis points higher than last year and more than twice our cost of capital as a result were continuing to make smart investments in our business whether itd be in new fuelefficient airplanes scimitar winglets to improve fuel efficiency or mobile devices for employees so that they can better serve customers well take delivery of  ers this year  next year and  ers and our first max in  the vast majority of these airplanes will replace the  s were retiring over the next two years the result is that mainline fleet will grow by  units this year and six units total over the next two years these new airplanes will help us further increase our cost advantage over the highercost network carriers we project fullyear capex to be approximately  million consistent with prior guidance which would result in us generating about  million of free cash flow using consensus estimates this quarter we repurchased  million shares for  million bringing our yeartodate repurchases to  million or the equivalent of about  of the total shares outstanding at the beginning of the year weve now repurchased more than  billion of our stocks since  that translates to about onethird of the outstanding shares our current  million authorization will be completed later this year and well update you on our plans for the next share repurchase authorization once weve met with our board later this summer in mid alaska initiated a dividend and has paid out  million in quarterly dividends in less than two years our stock continues to have the highest dividend yield in the airline industry were generating strong cash flows that are more diverse than ever our investmentgrade balance sheet derisks the cash flows to our owners our costs continue to come down we have no net debt were buying back a lot of stock and were paying a meaningful dividend this is a highquality industrial business and more importantly our people are taking great care of our customers and running a safe and reliable operation both things they need to do for us to succeed long term i want to thank our nearly  employees for their efforts and congratulate them once again for a record quarter and with that well open it up to questions that you may have questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of savi syth with raymond james your line is open savanthi n syth  raymond james  associates inc hey good morning just would like to talk a little bit more on the comments about the new market openings and the comment where you opened  over the last two or three years and youre opening  in the second half this year i was just wondering if that then bodes for greater pressure in unit revenues in the second half and also as you think about  is this taking advantage of lower fuel this year and moving forward some of the markets you would have opened or should we expect kind of similar new market additions in  andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer hi savi this is andrew savanthi n syth  raymond james  associates inc hey andrew andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer just a small correction the  new markets have all been started since the second quarter of  and the additional  over the rest of this year these are not in any way in response to current levels of fuel at all in fact if you look at the new markets  of them are actually to destinations that have no yearround nonstop service today and as weve shared earlier on the call these markets are all just expansion and diversification of our revenue streams as it relates to unit revenue i dont have the number off the top of my head but what i will tell you is many of these are midcontinent and transcon longerstage length markets that we launched bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president and then savi its brad i was looking at these numbers a couple of days ago of those  markets eight of them are markets you know about its charleston raleigh nashville costa rica milwaukee oklahoma city and then theres a bunch in there like boisereno lamonterey eugenesan jose theres some smaller markets in there so its not  midcon or transcon routes that are being added just to make sure you have the correct understanding of whats going on savanthi n syth  raymond james  associates inc thats helpful thank you and then just a followup on another comment about the – being mindful about the third quarter and exposure to hawaii and i believe it was the last guy could you talk a little bit more about what youre seeing in those markets andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer yes savi just in general if you look at – weve talked about our industry asm both in hawaii and alaska and especially as we move into the peak summer period were seeing higherthanaverage industry increases in asms in those markets the good news though is we still run good load factors and given our outstanding network i think we have a number of options whether its connecting passengers management of peak flights to continue to improve the performance of these regions savanthi n syth  raymond james  associates inc okay that was helpful thanks bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thanks savi operator your next question comes from the line of julie yates with credit suisse your line is open julie a yatesstewart  credit suisse securities usa llc broker good morning thanks for taking my question bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president good morning brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance good morning julie julie a yatesstewart  credit suisse securities usa llc broker i know its still early and youre still finalizing your plans for next year but any preliminary indication on how youre thinking about capacity and growth opportunities next year especially if fuel remain sub  a barrel andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer hi julie its andrew thanks for the question as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we took a really good look at the fourth quarter and as i shared we took five lines of flying out and reallocated those while we were doing that we were also looking at our  capacity and what i can share at this preliminary time is that where we see things today our growth next year will be lower than our growth this year and somewhere in the high singledigits thats all i can share right now julie a yatesstewart  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay very helpful thank you and then another question the rest of your peers saw a pretty dramatic change in the yield environment midway through q and you guys obviously have less exposure in the most affected areas and are actually performing more in line with the aa average than you have in the past for some time so would you say you saw any material change in the yield environment in the quarter or is it more status quo for you guys with the exception of hawaii im just trying to think about that in the context of directionally how prasm yearoveryear changes in the second half of the year andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer yeah i think as we – if i just look back over the last six months our yield decline have been fairly consistent give or take a point same with our loads so we havent really seen a huge underlying change in the pattern the only real driver for us i think is as we either launch new markets or industry capacity changes a little bit but the fundamentals of our business we havent seen any really shifting julie a yatesstewart  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay and then any comment on just how we should think about prasm change trending in the second half of the year as comps ease and competitive capacity growth slows andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer we dont really provide any type of guidance like that so i wont be commenting on that but thanks for the question julie a yatesstewart  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay understood thank you bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thanks julie operator your next question comes from the line of hunter keay with wolfe research your line is open hunter k keay  wolfe research llc good morning guys bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president good morning hunter brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance hi hunter hunter k keay  wolfe research llc so brad did you feel like alaska has the best opportunity in the industry at least among airlines that you feel like youre comparable to so likely excluding some of the ulccs would you say you have the best opportunity in the industry to sustain these margins or at least a level very close to these margins over the next two years to three years in the event that the fuel prices rise given the huge pill you guys just swallowed from competitive capacity growth that was unique to you and given the line of sight that you have on your nonfuel costs bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president hunter thanks for the question i might not bite on the industry part of it but what i would say is that were feeling really really good these markets that we just launched in the milwaukee and oklahoma city portland st louis were going to do portland to austin they look like theyre going to have fantastic returns were super excited about moving into raleigh and charleston and nashville costa rica theres a lot of excitement when we look at things and were sort of following all of the concern about prasm and all that when we look at this were deploying capacity thats producing great results great profits for our business so were excited about doing that and i dont know as i look at us against the industry what i would say is that we do have great operational performance weve got a very good competitive position with respect to our cost structure which gives us the ability to offer low fares and you hear us talking a little bit more about service the reason this company is still here today and independent is because we give our customers great service and were trying to let our employees know that we know that and we value them and we value what theyre doing for our customers so without saying too much about the other guys what i would say is we feel very good about the growth that alaskas putting into the marketplace and its great in this environment that were sort of expanding our capital base and are expanding our revenue base and doing that in a way thats helping the owners of the business hunter k keay  wolfe research llc okay brad thanks and bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president yeah hunter k keay  wolfe research llc brandon a  – the cash deployment obviously is great on many levels on an absolute level a  capital deployment yield is not that compelling with record margins and peak margins if you want to call it that so i guess can you help me understand the value proposition of continuing to buy planes with cash i mean i think you said you had what  of them already you own free and clear so with interest rates at these levels again with the caveat that the buyback is already very robust why arent you borrowing more money and buying back more stock at this point brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance hi hunter hunter k keay  wolfe research llc hi brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance that fits squarely into the what have you done for me lately category i actually dont feel bad about where our balance sheet is we have kind of a fortress balance sheet going right now were proud of the fact that weve been able to finance all our capex with operating cash flow and that theres still a whole bunch of money left over for us to return to our shareholders weve always said that we would use that to manage the capital structure and we originally thought we would probably do that in  but cash flow has been really strong and so i think that well probably end up not doing that in  but perhaps early in  but that doesnt mean that were not really focused on making sure that our capital structure sits in the right place and that were doing the right things for our owners in terms of capital return hunter k keay  wolfe research llc all right brandon thank you a lot bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thanks hunter operator your next question comes from the line of joseph denardi with stifel your line is open joseph w denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey thanks good morning bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president morning joseph w denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc brad i think on the last call you talked about kind of maybe revisiting the fourth quarter capacity outlook and sounds like andrew did that to some extent and redeployed some of that capacity so i guess why was that decision made and what makes you feel comfortable that kind of coming in at the higher end of the guidance is the right way to do it bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president yeah thanks joe yeah so lets just talk about that a little bit more i think what we would say is that we totally agree with the sort of the premise of your question which is that understanding the natural demand and getting the capacity right is the best thing you can do to sort of ensure that you have profitable returns on your investment so we went through our fourth quarter schedule and we did day of week cuts we did time of day cuts and we actually produced five – we reduced our flying by five airplanes which on a base of  is a lot and then the question is what – and that will help all of the returns and all of those whatever  city pairs or whatever it is and then we took those five airplanes and said whats the best thing to do with them is the best thing to park them and sort of let them sit idle or is the best thing to deploy them in new markets where we can deploy them and produce returns that exceed our cost of capital so i guess what were saying joe is we do agree with the premise of the question and i think youre going to see some of the economic benefit come through with that but we did redeploy the airplanes having said all of that i will also tell you that as we think about our  growth our mindset has moved a little bit in the last couple of months as we look at everything that were looking at we were thinking of something a little more robust a couple of months ago and were actually bringing that number down we havent actually shared that number with the street yet but our mindset has come down by two percentage points or three percentage points from where it would have been lets just say  days ago or something like that joseph w denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thats helpful i guess kind of following onto that i mean should we assume that if your roic continues to exceed your cost of capital the way it is that youre going to exercise all of your capex options and that numbers going to continue to go up and your capacity runrate is going to be higher than the historical average bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president yeah i think – im not sure – i might need to think about your question a little bit more but i do think that we are going to try to do the right thing i think the company has been a leader in this area were going to do the right thing for the owners of this business if the right thing is to take new capital and deploy it in places that weve got a tremendous economic engine here and its sort of rooted in seattle if the right place is to grow seattle and invest in seattle i think you will see us do that but we will also – i dont know as i just said in my earlier response we do understand that getting capacity right is a big part of having the right returns on an investment and we will – i think this company has been quite good at that and i think you should expect us to continue to be focused on it joseph w denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then if i could just slip in a last one for andrew american getting to a single res system later this year can you quantify what benefit you might realize from that based on some discussions youre having with them about new opportunities once they get that andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer yeah joe actually im going to provide more information later on through the quarter on this what i will tell you is to your point a single res system opens up significant ability for our customers to have a massively expanded network from which to accrue and redeem miles on we continue to see doubledigit growth in our relationship with sharing passengers with american and again as this unfolds and we get better visibility well definitely share more with you on this topic joseph w denardi  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thanks joe operator your next question comes from the line of helane becker with cowen your line is open helane r becker  cowen  co llc thanks operator hi everybody thanks for the time i have two questions – or three questions one is seattle i think is one of the fastest growing cities in the country and maybe the fastest and as you think about all these passengers who are traveling through your airport what type of investment should we think about that you have to make in airport infrastructure to handle the growth benito minicucci  chief operating officer and executive vice president operations alaska airlines inc helane its ben its a great question helane im going to say about a year ago we did see some issues processing passengers ill tell you what we did at the ticket counter area we almost doubled our size in taking more ticket counter space so where it was very congested now it flows fairly easily i can tell you on the gates we optimized how we use our gate to get quicker turns on our gates to make sure we could deal with increased capacity were also using gates across the whole airport so from the south end to the north end and third were investing in technology i think were working on technology where customers can quickly get into the gate – get from the curb to the gate in under  minutes and i think thats one thing there and then the biggest one is an investment in our north satellite which is about a  million investment that will add approximately eight gates over the next two years to four years helane r becker  cowen  co llc you said curb to gate in less than  minutes isnt that a long time though benito minicucci  chief operating officer and executive vice president operations alaska airlines inc well sorry one of the things we were looking at was how you drop your bags so for example if you show up at the curb you can get through the ticket counter in under  seconds thank you for correcting me  helane r becker  cowen  co llc yeah all right i was prepared to be scared and then i think brad you said there was a board meeting coming up this summer is that when we would hear you think about reauthorizing or increasing the share repurchase program i mean we think you only have about  million left based on your information today so why wouldnt you have increased it bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president that would be a good time for us to talk with the board about a question like that in the board meetings in early august rd th th of august something like that helane r becker  cowen  co llc okay great all right well thanks those were all my questions bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thanks helane benito minicucci  chief operating officer and executive vice president operations alaska airlines inc thanks helane operator your next question comes from the line of jamie baker with jpmorgan your line is open jamie n baker  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning team sort of continuing on that last point i dont want to take anything away from your second quarter you were absolutely correct to point out the strength in margins the degree to which roic exceeded that of last year best quarter in the your history and so forth no argument no pushback on any of that but what is lacking in the release today is how these results might be impacting your behavior going forward i mean ordinarily i also would have expected perhaps an upward revision to your roic target or maybe another added layer to the buyback or a boosted dividend and i dont want to read too much into this but why the conservatism in light of such strong results is it merely that you just havent met with the board yet or are you keeping your powder deliberately dry for something else and of course that will lead us to speculate on what that might be brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance jamie its brandon maybe ill take that and brad can clean up the mess that i make i dont think you should read anything into our lack of a big bang of any sort were really proud of our second quarter results we think were doing the right thing for the business not just in the shortterm and the long term and you know alaska we have sort of a methodical way of doing things we think about longer term things like the longerterm track record of dividend increases that we want to show you years from now we think about the timing of board meetings for authorization of share repurchase program but i dont think you should necessarily read anything into the fact that we had a great quarter but we didnt take some big bold action i think those things will come with time and well continue our track record of doing the right things for our customers and our owners and our shareholders bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president and jamie just to put a little bit of punch on that i think in time you will see a new – and i shouldnt speak for the board but you know our history with share repurchases and i think it would be totally appropriate to assume that that continues we do want to increase the dividend regularly i think you should expect to see that occur and we have been talking about this roic goal and what – weve been talking about that a little bit in the last few days i think as we sort of put the finishing touches on our  plan that might be a time for us to come out with some new thinking on that but ill tell you that we sort of do – we have done a lot of looking not just at airlines but at highquality industrial companies and were sort of getting ourselves schooled up on what are they generally earning in terms of returns – in terms of whats the gap in terms of roics above their cost of capital and getting ourselves smarter about that and i think youll see something from us there as well jamie n baker  jpmorgan securities llc its a highgrade analysis to be conducting im sure okay thanks very much for that color that was excellent i appreciate it bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president yeah brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance thanks jamie operator your next question comes from the line of duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi your line is open duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi hey thanks bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president hi duane brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance good morning duane duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi just following up to helanes question a little bit on seattle and the capacity utilization of that airport today as it relates to alaska and also competitors that are trying to grow there can you talk about how much excess capacity there is in that airport at sort of peak times of the day benito minicucci  chief operating officer and executive vice president operations alaska airlines inc no – duane its ben peak times of the day there is no capacity i can tell you that there are capacity in the shoulders and as we talked to the port here long term in the next two years to five years six years when these capital projects get built for bigger gates there are going to be constraints even at the peak time of day so peak time of days this airport is full unless you do some other type of thing but i would say that thats the quick answer were full at the peak theres some capacity in the shoulders duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi thanks for that and then brandon just a quick one for you how do you expect us to believe your cost guidance for the third quarter brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance duane i expect you to believe our cost guidance because thats what weve put in our investor update and we try our best to forecast our costs for the quarter and for the year and what i will tell you is things come earlier sometimes than we expect and things come later sometimes than we expect and our costs – we adjust our cost guidance through the quarter and as you saw this quarter our actual cost result was right in the range of our last investor update duane pfennigwerth  evercore isi okay thanks very much bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thanks duane brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance thanks duane operator your next question comes from the line of darryl genovesi with ubs your line is open darryl genovesi  ubs securities llc hi guys thanks for taking the question bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president hi darryl darryl genovesi  ubs securities llc brandon i was going to ask you about the casm guidance for the third quarter as well i think duane kind of took care of it but i mean just thinking about how the guidance has changed for the full year relative to the guidance that you provided us with q results back in april i heard the list of items that you kind of rattled off it seem to me that maybe the maintenance credit was perhaps the only one that you wouldnt have seen coming so just wondering with the level of – with the magnitude of the beat and the q cost trajectory why wouldnt the full year move brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance darryl its brandon thanks for the questions just to give you a little bit of context there was a big maintenance credit in the quarter and that was worth about  of the  reduction in unit costs and then just good cost performance in the last month and just normal closing stuff was about the other  of that our actual cost result was at the low end of the range that we provided so we were within the range youre right in my prepared remarks i did try to give context to the q increase in cost and what i will say is theres things that – as i said to duane there are things that result and just timing things landing in one quarter or another and in this quarter weve got things that make a really hard comp and so were up  notwithstanding that we still think that were down  for the year your question might be how come were not leveraging more of that cost savings in q into the back half its an excellent question we would like to do more were super focused on cost reductions but there are some things like incentive pay that is higher than we expect property taxes that were much higher than we expected and continued investments into the onboard product thats going to eat up some of that goodness that we saw in the second quarter darryl genovesi  ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then i also just want to ask you quickly on the fuel efficiency of the fleet i think you said its up   better over the course of the last two quarters i think you were kind of  better on average in  compared to  as well should we essentially assume that youre on kind of a  basis points  basis points a year sort of improvement trajectory until youre done retiring all the classics mark g eliasen  treasurer  vice presidentfinance hey daryl its mark eliasen ill just say that were focused on fuel efficiency in all aspects of our business we do think that getting the classics out of there as you know we have  of them they burn the same amount of fuel as a er yet carry  fewer passengers so as we get those  out of the fleet over the next yearanda half that will improve our fuel efficiency i cant give you the exact number as far as how many bps that will improve it but that along with many other things were doing you should see our fuel efficiency continue to rise darryl genovesi  ubs securities llc right bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president yeah we could run those numbers but theres a bunch of retirements what is it mark   retirements in  and  mark g eliasen  treasurer  vice presidentfinance yeah in the next yearandahalf bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president it should pop pretty substantially when that occurs mark g eliasen  treasurer  vice presidentfinance yeah and our winglet program were putting winglets – the split winglets on our ng fleet so that will help as well and then of course when we get the max in  thats going to be another improvement so we see continued fuel efficiency improvements throughout as long as we can see darryl genovesi  ubs securities llc great thanks very much guys bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president yeah mark g eliasen  treasurer  vice presidentfinance thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david fintzen from barclays your line is open david fintzen  barclays capital inc hey good morning everyone first question really for andrew if my memory serves going back to the investor day you had started to talk about kind of filling out the seattle markets that you hadnt touched historically obviously youve been doing that this year can you just help us think through  i mean are you largely through that process or are there sort of another wave of markets that you think could keep you busy in seattle and maybe then into portland for a while andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer yeah good morning i think while we dont talk about future markets i have shared in my prepared remarks weve got the embraer  coming onboard which – this aircraft actually allows us to unlock cities that we really cant fly on the qs and the mainline jets profitably so i think youre going to continue to see us continue to work those types of markets and as such as new markets i didnt get a chance to mention but like as brad mentioned on competition just looking at the second quarter about  of our capacity was driven by firstclass asm but our revenues contribution by that was over  and so we continue to look at our cabins and our classes of service and i still believe theres big opportunity to continue to invest in our product in the first class and increase that but overall in the pacific northwest as we continue to manage our costs as we continue to look at our network and grow our network and grow our connections as well as our international connections we continue to see opportunity to grow in the pacific northwest david fintzen  barclays capital inc okay thats helpful and just to sort of mix a little bit of what you said in terms of improve the product with some of the cost comments i mean should we think of that product improvement as sort of when we get a sustained beat in a quarter not to get too carried away with it over – for some period because it will just accelerate some of those investments in onboard product i mean is that the way we should translate that comment into cost going forward andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer no i dont think so i think when you look at like brandon shared around like for instance food and beverage but as traditional here when we launch new products we have a lot of process boarded to consumed ratios of foods we have a lot of opportunity even though were adding cost to our aircraft through investments on onboard products to actually continue to get more efficient and productivity and i think bens become – and his team have become just amazing folks of getting capacity out of our core operations and so as we invest in our product were going to get better about getting efficiency and productivity out of that as well so personally i think you shouldnt expect to see that continued cost increase overall brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance hey david its brandon one other thought there we talk a lot about the drivers of the cost increases and we get into things like food and beverage a lot of our onboard product is buyonboard and were seeing nice growth in buyonboard sales the customers really – there is a good uptake of that product and thats pretty small in the context of the revenue line but it is an offset to the cost that we talk about down below david fintzen  barclays capital inc okay thats helpful appreciate all that color thanks brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of richard salazaar with deutsche bank your line is open michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc hey its mike linenberg if i could just jump in in front of rich if thats okay good morning everyone brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance hey mike bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president good morning michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc two questions here andrew if i could just go back to what you had mentioned earlier about the connection with emirates you said that previously it was  passengers a day between you and them and that with the second flight that that had moved to  passengers how much of that is stimulative or is that just all shift – share shift andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer i dont know the exact answer to that question but what ill tell you is that and you even take out hainan for instance where the marketing machine has been set on idle and has done nothing were already seeing significant increases in connecting traffic there and we havent even begun to market this new relationship so i cant speak to where its coming where its going as far as stimulation or share shift all i know is that there is good demand for these connections and were going to continue to grow michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc and when you mentioned the marketing machine on idle thats because as i recall correctly i dont think you have a codeshare with emirates is that right or do you have one andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer so i think with the hainan but even as we think about our international partners and we talk about how we can market better together in the marketplace we just – we have not done a good job at leveraging our international carriers and working together to become more of a joint force in the marketplace and youre going to see more of that and i think theres going to be good things in store michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc okay just to be clear you dont have a codeshare with them with emirates thats right andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer correct michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just secondly on some of these new markets out of los angeles like costa rica i think baltimore is another one correct me if im wrong on that but they have lower yield are these markets going to receive the support of american marketing from day one or are you going to have the american codeshare on them or is that a longerterm opportunity andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer you know what i cant really comment on future code and no code but i think what a fair statement of facts are is that both american and alaska are very excited about our partnership we are working together where we can and los angeles is a natural partnership ground for us there and i think as we launch any new market we think about our customer base our alliances and partnerships and how can we work together michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc okay great and so theyre already being marketed though right youve already loaded the flights to costa rica and baltimore andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer correct michael j linenberg  deutsche bank securities inc okay okay great okay very good thank you bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of daniel mckenzie with buckingham research your line is open dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc hey good morning guys thanks for the time here a couple questions where is the analysis leading you on a more expanded preferred seating product so call it five or six rows with more legroom versus whats offered today how are you balancing the pros and cons of that investment with what your codeshare partners are already doing andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer dan as brad alluded in his prepared remarks were finding some very interesting results just with our preferred seating and the behaviors and as weve mentioned before we continue to look at our onboard product in maximizing revenue for each shift that we fly and looking at the loyalty program so all i can say is that we continue to look at how this plays out for us and we dont have anything to report other than that dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc okay very good and i guess just following up on mikes question theres obviously a lot of moving pieces with respect to revenue from codeshare partners but where are we today exactly so what is the total revenue from codeshare partners and does that reflect a decline or an increase from a year ago and how do we think about that revenue – that piece of the revenue puzzle looking ahead andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer i mean i think – i mean if you just look at q really big picture including interline codes partners everybody i think its about  comes from those other carriers and as weve shared previously income buckets delta is down over  in the second quarter but we also have good increases on our own metal and our partners metal so its shifting around but overall its still fairly stable as the big picture pie goes as it relates to connectivity dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc good job andrew if i can just squeeze one final one here bill gates had a nice interview this quarter on biofuels and if you believe him probably will be a huge payday some day you guys are one of the first to stick your toes in the water here years ago and i realize the investment is tiny and notwithstanding where oil is today is this something you guys are still pursuing and if so when could the investment realistically drive some kind of a return joseph a sprague  vice presidentmarketing alaska airlines inc hey dan this is joe sprague biofuels is absolutely something were still interested in in fact were hoping to do yet another demonstration flight later this year with a new type of biofuels as you pointed out we were the first airline in the country to fly a series of biofuels flights when we did so a couple of years ago notwithstanding the lower fuel prices today we do believe that this is an important part of our fuel supply going forward both for fuel efficiency fuel cost reasons but also just for really positive environmental reasons and in fact that the airline industry is going to have some sort of standard that theyre going to have to adhere to coming down from icao in the years ahead and we think biofuels is going to have to be a part of that solution so our intent is to absolutely continue to be a leader in this area a challenge is the lack of production facilities for biofuels and thats starting to be addressed a little bit around the country but were tracking that very closely and working with our good partners at boeing and elsewhere to make certain that we are in a position that we can optimize that when more fuel supply comes online dan j mckenzie  the buckingham research group inc very good thanks guys andrew r harrison  executive vice president and chief revenue officer thanks dan bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president thank you lavanya sareen  managing directorinvestor relations we have time for one more question operator your next question comes from the line of rajeev lalwani with morgan stanley your line is open rajeev lalwani  morgan stanley  co llc hi thanks for squeezing me in here bradley d tilden  chief executive officer and president hi rajeev brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance hi rajeev rajeev lalwani  morgan stanley  co llc just a question on the cost side i get there is a fair amount of moving parts this year but can you just talk going forward maybe what some of the biggest risks are for you in terms of continuing to keep casmex at sort of a flat to down level brandon s pedersen  chief financial officer  executive vice president finance rajeev good morning its brandon thinking into the future we said a couple of times tonight or this morning that our bias is to continue to work toward driving costs down to make us look more like a low cost carrier and expand the gap that we have over the legacy carriers in terms of risk you never know one thing we do have is nice visibility to our labor costs over the next few years i think weve talked about the increase in fuel or the increase in our fuel competitiveness but as we think about fuel casm coming down other than that its all about investments that we have and we choose to make who knows whats going to happen to pension thats always one that seems to come out and bite us somehow but i dont know its a good question i dont have anything specific to offer in terms of risks because i think we do have pretty good visibility over the next couple of years rajeev lalwani  morgan stanley  co llc

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
