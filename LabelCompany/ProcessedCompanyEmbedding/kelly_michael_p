michael slezak  april    am pdt  did a screaming hairy armadillo just amble into the middle of reported tensions between kelly ripa and michael strahan toward the end of thursday’s live with kelly and michael mutual of omaha’s peter gros brought out the mammal as part of an animal segment noting its size and lack of teeth forces it to scare off predators by shrieking “he’s about to scare me away” chimed in strahan as the creature continued its noisy protests relatedkelly ripa returns to live addresses strahan exit dustup ‘our national nightmare is over’ — watch video seconds later ripa declared that “something just flew off of the armadillo and into my mouth” when gros asked if she’d like a napkin ripa exclaimed “i want to take him into contract negotiations with me” before breaking up with laughter “he always gets his way with a predator” joked gros in response strahan for his part didn’t even crack a smile then scrunched up his nose as he and ripa caught a whiff of the pungent beast “he’s got a nice smell to him” strahan observed sarcastically also smelling peculiar over the past two days neither strahan nor ripa has uttered a word on air about strahan’s significantly movedup exit date relatedkelly ripa michael strahan not attending daytime emmy awards indeed when abc first announced on april  that strahan would jump ship from live to good morning america it was reported that he would continue on with the former program through the end of summer shortly after the tuesday april  live telecast however word surfaced that strahan’s last appearance on the show would be may  ripa blindsided by news of strahan’s exit called in sick on april  then took some previously scheduled vacation right after only returning to the show on april  when she addressed the controversy headon “i needed a couple of days to gather my thoughts after  years with this company i earned the right” she said adding “what transpired over the course of a few days has been extraordinary in the sense that it started a much larger conversation about communication and consideration and most importantly respect in the workplace and since we’re being honest i don’t consider this just a workplace this is my second home” relatedmichael strahan poised to make very premature exit from live ripa at the time added she was “thrilled” for strahan and had been assured by abc brass that “live is a priority” — an important factor considering that ripa was reportedly vexed by rumors that abc was looking to add an extra hour to gma which would bump live from its am perch on most abc stations strahan will continue to appear on gma throughout the summer where he has made regular appearances since  he will also serve as host of abc’s upcoming  pyramid reboot debuting sunday june  at c additionally according to the hollywood reporter ryan seacrest is being eyed as a possible replacement for strahan in the wake of the american idol host reupping with abc to host four more

is working out well for keeping the focus on “live” methinks this is a part of abckelly ripa’s plan to help out with ratings at live since they’re clearly in the news more because of this gives ripa more leverage when she is in fact negotiating her contract too… reply lariet says april   at  am the entire “scandal” in a nutshell right here reply david says april   at  am i’ve been saying this since it started it clearly is helping ratings for both live and gma reply angie kyles frazier says april   at  am i think you just might be right i never that about it that way reply doug g says april   at  am i hope that abc is smarter than to negotiate her contract she is not the only reason live does so well in the ratings this lady is a farce and when the ratings drop who is to blame ripa is a spoiled brat and now abc needs to replace  people reply lt says april   at  am she rejected you in hs eh reply mary says april   at  pm considering she has been constant i don’t think your statement is valid stop watching since you clearly do not like her me thinks some just like to complain behind their key boards reply julie mccaughey says april   at  pm i already quit watching her michael was the only reason that i would occasionally turn “live” on reply deleted says april   at  pm deleted reply j hollingsworth says april   at  pm i agree kelly ‘used to be more downtoearth and less selfcentered less self absorbed she sure has a case of the bighead at millionperyear for fivehours a week of conversing and small talk kelly needs to ‘face reality live with kelly is a team effort not just kelly live has been on air for  years kelly has only been there for  years – share some credit with regis reply sherr says april   at  pm maybe you’d like to repost that again under yet another name jeri says april   at  am kelly was on a soap for many years also believe that is what she is referring to larue says april   at  am amen ed says april   at  pm amen reply kat taylor says may   at  am you are absolutely correct i like michael and can’t stand kelly…therefore i stopped watching…she is a “witch” with a “b” she makes  million…and abc pays that reply linda silkwood says september   at  pm i agree reply beach says april   at  am what’s up with methinks sarah reply maryam aziz says april   at  am perhaps she is channeling the bard reply tvinsider says april   at  pm today is the first day of may sweeps reply j hollingsworth says april   at  pm that’s true ratings time reply ed says april   at  pm they need to find someone else there are way too many people in hollywood and new york that are much more talented than her she is benefiting from what was built by regis and kathie lee give me a break million a year and all her demandsher and her husband act like she is a god or royalty i am done with this show and them goodbye reply nancy taylor says july   at  am i quit watching kelly she is so self obsorbed seems to only want to talk about herself or her family we don’t need that much info on your life kelly… reply wrstlgirl says april   at  am i think kelly thinks shes funny a lot of the time but i’ve always found her jokes awkward rather than entertaining reply rachel says april   at  am ditto reply mika says april   at  am i’ve personally always found her to be fake and disingenuous not sure why some people love her so much reply dab says april   at  am i agree reply jd says april   at  am enough of this bimboplease reply keith says april   at  am you aren’t forced to watch her show or read anything about her reply joan reynolds says april   at  am it is not her show it’s ” live with kelly and michael ” no were does it say kelly ripa and guest co host  so please refrain from calling it her show …… reply  yikes says april   at  am i would rather have the armadillo as a co host than andy cohen who bugs me to no end reply mco says may   at  pm kelly and andy need to hold hands while taking a long walk off a short pier reply tony says april   at  am the show is a trainwreck … kelly can’t make eye contact strahan is uncomfortable it’s all very awkward to watch the banter is phony the laughter is phony the directed applause from the audience is phony … they obviously cannot stand one another torturous they photoshopped kelly’s eyes onto a hedgehog and she didn’t look amused at all what a waste of time this show is makes you realize there really isn’t a point to it at all reply photo says april   at  am awkward indeed…i thought i was imagining it but i thought he looked very uncomfortable he’s too nice for kelly…she’s enjoying stumping on his pleasant nature which makes her look like a petty vicious person reply mary says april   at  pm can’t be that nice maybe you should check with his exwife he probably should leave before may  because i get the impression he doesn’t want to be there as far as ryan maybe in the running – don’t think so i do not see him moving to ny to do a morning especially with everything else he has going on my solution to all you haters stop watching if it is so painful reply mic says may   at  pm vicious is correct – there is nothing pretty about kelly and she is thoroughly enjoying stumping on michael get him out of there reply readenreply says april   at  am kelly’s interview and interaction with keeganmichael key clearly shows how good she is at her job reply chris says april   at  am kelly’s behavior during this whole thing has been nothing short of unprofessional and insufferable if she is unhappy everyone else will be if she doesn’t like you you will know it just ask clay aiken she needs someone more superficial and more vacuous to play with on a daily basis like anderson cooper or andy cohen or ryan seacrest strahan is charming and did a great job but he’s a sports guy and was out of his element he needs to escape this prissy hissyfit playground immediately and work with some adults reply jd says april   at  am totally correct the producers and brass at abc have helped enable this driveling idiot to think what she’s doing for a job is just simply crucial to the world and everyone’s life she has lost perspective and is too busy looking at herself in the monitors every four seconds and bragging about another trip or buying something her illgotten gains has given her to just stop and realize what she’s really contributing disney should realize there needs to be no more  given to her she’s totally addicted to talking about herself…that should be their leverage she’d lose it if someone didn’t want to hear what she had to say why would anderson cooper give up a respectable gig to sit second chair to this vacuous nitwit she just wants a cohost that won’t challenge her image and will only talk about her life not their own cancel the show reply laura says april   at  am don’t forget that anderson cooper had a talk show that got cancelled reply keithh says april   at  am there’s a reason for the cancellation… called low ratings… reply andrea says april   at  am yep reply doug g says april   at  am ditto cancel this show or please get  new people i will quit watching until something is done this not live this is brat on national tv abc end it now reply mary says april   at  pm wow the jealousy on this site in beyond belief you probably don’t watch anyhow and if you do change the channel i think some of you are really threaten by a women’s success yes she is successful or the show wouldn’t have been on so long if she distresses you so much move on get a life reply fineandfabulousmag says april   at  pm i totally agree gender equality says may   at  am mary kelly is being unprofessional and she is harassing mr strahan mentioning personal information in regards to his divorce on national television during a moment in which he is departing from the show extremely distasteful i understand she is upset but there is a time and a place double standard between men and women mary kelly doesn’t get a pass on this one susan says april   at  am good advice for anderson cooper way too smart to sit next to her i use to like her years ago but you are correct it’s all about her or her kids or her husband who needs to watch that everyday today when it came on i went to today show reply mary says april   at  pm clearly you haven’t been a faithful viewer of the show because since the beginning they all talk about their lives regis and kathy lee did also green eye monster is not very becoming reply maco says may   at  pm i have watched live from the beginning michael is the best thing that ever happened to that show now that he is gone so am i nothing to say on kelly – because when you have nothing good to say don’ t day anything j hollingsworth says april   at  pm i agree the today show has really stepped it up fresh and funny they added in carson daly carson’s wife with lifestyle cooking segments willie geist and i just heard today billy bush from access hollywood is jumping ship for today – he’s a great addition very funny a good interviewer he listens and unlike kelly ‘the diva’ billy doesn’t insert ‘himself’ into the interview reply tvinsider says april   at  pm you realize part of her job is to talk about herself right reply angie kyles frazier says april   at  am i concur you hit the nail on the head reply photo says april   at  am this comment sums up the whole situation…i used to love kelly even on all my children… but she’s a bratty spoiled immature woman reply karen says april   at  am not a strahan fan especially with the latest dramahe should exit sooner rather than later abc execs have handled this whole thing poorly ryan seacrest or anderson cooper would work well as cohosts either way i think the show will be an improvement i may actually start watching again reply andrea says april   at  am they will need you to tune in now that he is leaving reply joanne sniegowski says may   at  am not a strahan fan either he’s a football guy and nothing else when he came on they began “reading” the current events i missed the old way where regis  kelly or kathie lee would just talk about what they did the previous night no reading off papers or cue cards i stopprd watching when when michael came onto me he was boring just like when her husband came on as long as gelman doesn’t completely run the show kelly will be fine reply susan mitchell says april   at  am kelly has an inflated ego she would be nothing without regis’s start now she has totally shut him out and she thinks she is the queen bee i am tired of her big ego her wonderful family stories and trips etc half the time she doesn’t even know how to pronounce some places and things good wishes to michael reply tvjunkie says april   at  am and michael would be nothing in this particular business without kelly so what’s your point the the people who are there help the new people to establish themselves well duh reply angie kyles frazier says april   at  am a person can help you get a job but it is up to the individual to maintain it michael is very charismatic and brings life to that show and it comes across genuine at the end of the day no job is secure she is paid to do a job and she needs to suit up and show up who calls out their bosses especially on television she signed a contract to do her job as long as the check clears it should not matter who leaves and who stays period reply marjorie jugan says april   at  am i agree with what pretty much has been said my main thing i smichael strahan is very likeable kelly ripa has lost her shine she has become a diva and unfortunately not very likeable i don’t watch because of her when she and mark are on together it is very awkward even though they are married who cares what thei rkids did and what not i am happy for michael and i hope he does well at gma reply linz smith says april   at  am if you’ll remember kathy lee’s kids grew up on live we heard when they threw up messed their diapers etc this was always part of the show sharon meyer says april   at  pm when she first started on the show i really liked her and found her refreshing i think her success must have gone to her head i quit watching several years ago maybe no one other than regis can stay refreshing after that many years i don’t know mary says april   at  pm his point was regis was not the reason she is successful she has more than put her time and skills into this show she has maintain it a person with self esteem calls out the bosses when they clearly are in the wrong it is okay to stand up for yourself and not be a doormat if you and many others cannot comprehend that then clearly you are the one with issues reply ad says april   at  pm her name is on the show for pity’s sake connie groblewsky says april   at  pm you hit the nail on the head i happen to love this show i think kelly is great and i think michael is great i am going to miss him when he leaves i’m sure they will get somebody just as good ad says april   at  pm when your name is on the show you call them out i applaud her all she did is take one day off to gather her thoughts she did nothing else reply robin says april   at  pm i have stopped watching the show for awhile now mainly because regis left i’m not sure exactly what kind of preparation it takes to do the job that kelly does however in my opinion she is paid far more than her education or experience deserves she is not an investigative reporter nor a news broadcast anchor she does not risk her life for others like the police or firemen and they make a fraction of what kelly and other celebrities make i would rather see the police and firemen make her salary and she make theirs she seems to be very spoiled and jealous reply eloise minn says april   at  am i’m happy you qualified your comment by saying “in this particular business” however even the selection of michael was abc executives decision not kelly’s they did make a dynamic duo though reply valarie rosenberg says april   at  am does the phrase “dumb blonde” mean anything here reply mary says april   at  pm derogatory remarks like that shows lack of intelligence reply tvinsider says april   at  pm are you one otherwise i think making more in an hour or two than most make in a year is pretty clever reply marie says april   at  am what would trump say she’s playing the women card on the backs of the underrepresented who has been disrespecting who can i get a let’s make america great again hat reply mary says april   at  pm are you threaten by a women standing up for herself clearly kelly is not the one with self esteem issues reply chris says april   at  am i saw it i loved it and kelly is genius so happy she slipped that comment in  i’m so sick of strahan – he’s just everywhere now he has another show… gag the show has been awkward yes – but as kelly said this is about entertainment btw why does a new cohost have to be male reply brookebs says april   at  am good point why don’t they consider another woman hmmmm… reply mac says april   at  pm cohost doesnt have to be male abc paired robin roberts and diane sawyer on gma for years and nbc has hoda  klg the shows audience is female but no doubt kr will have to give approval if she stays past next year if abc really wants to keep the show going hiring one of her friends not might be a great idea they want to avoid replacing both hosts at once since that makes it more difficult ripa may have shot herself in the foot but i think most women are still dan’s despite what a few posters here claim reply lou says may   at  pm i think kelly would feel threatened by having another woman cohost  she is very spoiled and has turned into a brat i have been watching this show since regis was on he was the funny one i tried to find the humor of what kelly said but she always has a dry sense of humor i really think she needs to practice what she preaches respect in the work place she certainly likes to interrupt people while they are talking i did enjoy watching her on the soap show however i did stop watching “live” after mr strahan left good luck and best wishes to him reply j hollingsworth says april   at  pm i agree michael has a lot of talent but he’s ‘oversaturated’ he’s everywhere fox football gma strahan clothing line product endorsement for protein shakes whis daughters – he was even in ‘magic mike’ too much he’s also making guest appearances on all the talk shows all strahan all the time reply geri c says april   at  am it’s time for kelly to goshe is too much of a diva and it showing more and moreshe has forgotten about her job is to be there for her fans not to fuss and look at herself in the camerakelly blindsided her fansi have stopped watching live and moved on to todayshame on you kelly you could have taken care of this off screen but then your ego would not have been satiified reply mary says april   at  pm i guess you have the belief that women should be seen and not be heard don’t make waves because heaven forbid you may step on someones toes or injure the fragile male egos this is  not the  you all should be commended her not belittle her nothing changes if everyone keeps quiet reply tvinsider says april   at  pm you people are too funny having worked in daytime talk  with celebrities they’re all pretty much divas  divos most of them are nothing off camera than on camera none of us know what really went on or was said abc is probably happier that kelly took a day off to cool down vs say something on live tv that they all would have regretted see star jones let it go if you don’t like the show don’t watch these jobs aren’t like normal jobs yes there r huge egos when people are compensated and treated like celebrities are they’re the bread butter… but also realize hundred people not making millions make their livelihood working on the show  reply bruce northwood says april   at  am why does anyone care reply j hughes says april   at  am rippa is that falling star egocentric gets you nowhere the death of her show looms near reply doug g says april   at  am we can be so lucky reply andrea says april   at  am stopped watching when regis left kelly is so annoying she makes millions of dollars talking to actors she is a yappy cry baby not a barbra walters or diane sawyer it is hard t look at someone who looks like they are starving themselves she is not funny they need two new hosts there are workers in this country who are really bullied are sexually harassedlose their jobs because of stupid office politics and she is making a big tissy fit over her co worker leaving wow what an insult to those who really suffer disrespect in the work place she talks the talk now let’s see if she will do anything for those who are true victimsor was her big speech just that a bunch of talk reply mary says april   at  pm you clearly missed the point of why she was upset michael leaving wasn’t the problem but it is obvious it went way over your head reply regis says april   at  am that armadillo accomplished what many would like to have done to ripa reply jeana says april   at  am she need to be professional and not a cry babyget over it life goes on reply dan king says april   at  am jaysus ripa what are you  reply mitzi carpenter says april   at  am wow…i’ve read most of the comments here i missed kelly and michael this morning because of a doctor’s appointment i’ve got to catch this episode on youtube or something a lot of you don’t like kelly and some don’t like michael you know who i didn’t like regis and kathy lee i was never so glad to see kelly come on that show when kathy lee left and there was just something about regis that sent chills up my spine like fingernails on a chalk board i thought michael has always done an excellent job as has kelly they keep me laughing unlike kathy lee as she talked about her son cody while regis rolled his eyes if strahan’s departure is coming sooner than september don’t let the door hit ya in the backside michael i think ryan secrest would be an excellent choice how about it ladies your morning coffee with a side of eye candy whoohoo reply jannet p says april   at  am i agree – kelly has become a diva – and i don’t get why i dont like the idea of ryan seacrest – he is too much a kardashian person i would like to see anderson cooper better yet with summer coming i will turn off the tv and go play with my horses reply ad says april   at  pm exactly i think they are a perfect pair but since he’s going secrest would make a nice addition reply semprasectum says april   at  am deleted reply chris says april   at  am agree  reply johnny says april   at  am hey news outlet way to create more controversy where there is rlly noneyou ate like the mean girl in high school  looking for drama and sowed gout negative writing reply anita winningticket says april   at  am leave already when regis spoke about you and couldn’t come up with a single nice thing to say told me you are a bitch bye bitch reply mary says april   at  pm regis has trouble remembering his name so that theory is out the window you might not care for her quite obvious but since the ratings have been good since regis left what does that tell you reply todd says april   at  am just pair kelly up with a regular rotation of her gay male friends that’ll stop all the boring sports patter reply lt says april   at  pm that’s cute you think gay people don’t watch sports… reply mary says april   at  pm you know the saying ignorance is bliss reply carol myersdencer says april   at  am ironically here in brevard county fl we see this show from  to  am on nbc in the middle of the today show…… today runs  to  then kelly  michael then the last segment of today… not sure what that’s all about i can understand kelly being upset but the more professional she acts now the better the numbers during contract renegotiation and it’s been reported that while she makes a very very good chunk of change each year she also spends a very very very good chunk of change……… reply mary says april   at  pm that is just gossip sites spreading things they have no clue about nobody knows her financial situation but to be honest kelly and mark don’t fit the bill of being in over their head reply stev says april   at  pm live is syndicated so it airs on different affiliates in different markets your situation is not typical i know in miami it aired on fox it is owned and produced by disneyabc and airs on abc owned stations  many of its affiliates your nbc station probably airs the a today at some other time reply kt says april   at  am this whole thing has done nothing but boost the ratings for the show i work during the day but on the occasions i have been home i can tolerate kelly ripa most of the time and even enjoy her humor and banter on other occasions i really have enjoyed watching the show with michael strahan on it as cohost kelly’s reaction to strahan’s decision to leave the show has been over the top childish – acting like a middleschooler whose boyfriend has decided to “date” another girl it has really turned me off to the show and i doubt i will watch it at all once strahan leaves reply j robert hanson says april   at  am if she’d come out and kissed strahan on the cheek some buffoon would have found some way to criticize her she’s in a nowin situation and abc put her there with what abc did i’d want the little devil creature on my side for negotiations too reply dan tolbert says april   at  am since armadillo’s carry ‘live leprosy’ germ in their skin  claws…… she got it in her mouth…cool bet new contract with ‘half a face’ kelly ripa would be a slam dunk reply ln says april   at  am this ding bat should be glad she even has a job the only negotiations i would be in with her is how much she would be paying me to stay she will never get a job anywhere else except on fox  friends or fox news they are the only other network that hires ding bat puppets she would fit right in with them reply mary says april   at  pm careful your stooping to name calling behind the keyboards shows your intelligence reply marlene reece says april   at  am move on kelly and get a new cohost i have never liked strahan and wondered why he was chosen in the first place you can do better reply dennis shoemake says april   at  am please please anybody except seacrest media is over blowing this whole drama for ratings mostly her first day back you could see the mood between thetwo in her face how dare you its all about me i am the star of this show yea right… reply gch says april   at  pm i agree anyone but seacrest kelly has been a class act all she did was demand the respect that she deserves as someone whose name is on the show if the tables were turned the male cohost would have never been treated that way if she did not demand the respect of the network they would think what they did to her was fine and proceed to do it again and again she has made the network a lot of money over they years she has been loyal they simply needed to return the favor it is really pretty simple to the haters out there if you don’t like kelly don’t watch she has proven to be very adept at her job over the past fifteen years and has largely carried the show if abc decided to cancel the show she would have no problem launching a show elsewhere reply mary says april   at  pm you said it perfectly the ones bashing her are probably in a dead end job with no self esteem that or are envious of her success reply yvin says april   at  pm the male executive producer michael gelman who has run that show from day  and was there decades before kelly wasn’t told either reply dawn says april   at  pm that’s true but gelman still reported to work reply stinkpickles says april   at  am i’d fire her she was nothing without regis who gave her live and she has never thanked him publicly she also doesn’t talk to regis and wants nothing to do with anyone antidiva this little blond talentless bimbo is a joke i’d fire her in a ‘new york minute’ give the gig to andrews she at least was genuinely funny reply mary says april   at  pm it is obvious you don’t know what your talking about because regis has been gone for quite some time and the show is still going your jealousy is showing time to move on and get a life reply betterunderstandings says april   at  am i hope she’s kidding about something from the armadillo landing in her mouth those things carry leprosy reply charlotte says april   at  am i like kelly but sometimes carries conversation to far and will not watch a co host that is gay reply lt says april   at  pm guess what sweetie gays are everywhere…some you probably even know now go clutch your pearls… reply mary says april   at  pm gay people are humans some have personality that would help a tv show many have great jobs and life sad really that in this day and age one judges someone because of their sexuality why are you on this site when many of the editors are gay please get educated or refrain from making statements like that reply youre a bigot sen cruz says april   at  pm you might as well never turn on a tv watch a movie go to a broadway show or open a magazine hate to tell you that without the lgbt community none of those things would happen luckily bigots like you are dying out  younger people treat everybody as equals reply mb says april   at  am kelly has been on abc for  years she deserves more respect if she were leaving the show instead of michael i am sure it would have been handled differently she is a very good interviewer and is a strong independent women most of your comments are so critical i bet you could not do her job nearly as well if you had here qualifications reply junradel cortezsantos says april   at  am i heard that too but who knows she might really need it when negotiating her contract they might mishandle her again this thing would maybe keep them in their toes hahaha… reply donald j quenneville says april   at  am ripa needs to put her big girl face on and stop this childish rant crap i put  years in one company and they respect me no more or no less that any other who worked there grow up…it’s just business reply junradel cortezsantos says april   at  am i heard that too who knows she might really need it when negotiating her contract that screaming armadillo might keep them in their toes so they do not mishandle her again hahaha… reply junradel cortezsantos says april   at  pm i heard that too who knows she might really need it when negotiating her contract the screaming armadillo will keep them in their toes so as not to mishandle her again hahaha… reply ad says april   at  pm so many kelly bashers on the boards if you hate her so much why spend so much time talking about her i think she is great at her job i hope she stays it’s funny people talk about the tension between her and michael but i’ve watched the last two shows not today’s yet and found them to be charming as usual they seemed to interact just fine people who have been in the audience say she is someone who comes out to personally greet audience members yeah that’s really diva like and talk with them i think it’s sad she’s under fire so much negativity these days reply victoria smith tahoe says april   at  pm the show is tired stale and old…time for it to end reply tvinsider says april   at  pm why would you want a hundred people to lose their job why would a network cancel a popular  profitable show in an era where it’s very difficult to launch a new one the shows been on for three decades and has been renewed thru  turn the channel if you don’t like it but don’t understand all the anger  vitriol its a stupid talk show it shouldn’t affect your life reply paulette says april   at  pm i agree with the majority of people on here but michael should have told her about him leaving the show i would feel betrayed also i don’t think she handled it very well and shame on her she is treating everyone like they are responsible for her problems i am sure behind scenes she is not being nice to anyone i hope she gets herself put back together for the sake of the audience and the show reply tvinsider says april   at  pm he did tell her and he told her months before he was scheduled to leave she doesn’t write his check the ceo of disney and the head of abc make those decisions he basically got a promotion transfer he couldn’t say anything until a deal was signed its not like he’s going to another company to start a competing show like joan rivers did to johnny carson back in the day i don’t know what people wanted from him he was supposed to tell her he’s negotiating before it was a deal he would have lost his job why aren’t we hearing about gelman being angry some wonder if kelly has a history of not handling these things well as regis also didn’t tell her in advance plus she was already not happy about strahan doing gma if she really didn’t like working with him she should be happy one of the main reasons for her freak out was fear this was a clear sign abc would expand gma to the am hour reply lee says may   at  am well said i agree reply betsy ferguson says april   at  pm the show has been on alot of years let him go to gma and find someone else i enjoy the show every morning it is very intesting to see all the different stars reply jm says april   at  pm why does micheal have three jobs there are not enough men without jobs to have one of these reply ms faye says april   at  pm michael is a hard working young man who works tirelessly and gets along with people very well and by the way he’s not the only man who works more that one job reply maxx says april   at  pm seacrest no and he wouldn’t come cheap reply kaye conn says april   at  pm i think miss kelly owes michael an apology as of may th i will no longer watch this show kelly acts like she is royalty and will be greatly disappointed when she realizes she is not reply marleen burch says april   at  pm i think its time everyone moves on let’s get some new blood on tv ryan seacrest has been around too long too let’s have some try outs like on the voice or american idol for some new hosts there there is a new show for you my husband  i have a great food  wine radio show  he would be awesome reply jef says april   at  pm kelly wouldn’t approve of a pro like ryan reply gertrude henson says april   at  pm okmichael is moving forward what is the big deal with kelly she want respect… i would think very hard bfore l would even be a cohost with her this is very childish l don’t watch live anymore l been a fan ever since regis kathy lee can’t believe her action reply pamela hoelk says april   at  pm it was pretty rotten of michael strayhan to handle the situation the way he did he owes kelly more loyalty than that considering what she did for him getting him on the show in the first place in my estimation it has cost michael strayhan a great deal as far as my perception of him reply ms faye says april   at  pm she may have helped to get michael on the show but she did not pay his salary apparently the execs liked what they saw in him and thought he could handle more to help gma they went to him so what was he going to say “no” i think not he has apologized numerous times to kelly and was sincerely genuine in his welcoming her back to the showi watch this show everyday and i have observed michael talking and trying to laugh with kelly before this controversy began but her smile sometimes was short and abrupt whenever she had a guest on to fill in for michael she would grin from ear to ear with the guest i love them both but i hope she is happy with her new cohost and i wish michael much success and happiness don’t understand why she is angry at michael for the decisions made by the the powersthatbe but they both will be fine blessings to both of them reply karen jones says april   at  pm michael should walk away with his head held high…he’s a nice guy that everyone likes …and kelly is acting very strange towards him on the show…hellooooo…it’s very obvious to the viewers…and guess what michael is suppose to look out for himself…kelly isn’t coming off as the nice girl she’s been pretending to be all of this time michael isn’t her man…he’s her cohost…remember reply see more comments todays hottest
