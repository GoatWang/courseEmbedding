and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest

financial market conditions changing market perceptions of the risk of default changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer these factors may also lead to periods of high volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets singlestate investments are at risk of common economic forces and other factors affecting a states taxexempt investments this may result in greater losses and volatility capital gains if any are taxed at the federal and in most cases state levels for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable you can lose money by investing in the fund

fund is now available ntf no transaction fee and offered loadwaived through fidelity summary overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment

believes is consistent with preservation of capital strategy the fund invests mainly in bonds that pay interest that is exempt from federal income tax and minnesota personal income tax but that may be subject to federal alternative minimum tax amt are investmentgrade in quality and have intermediate to longterm maturities ie three years or longer it invests at least  of the funds net assets in taxexempt investments risk the municipal market can be affected by adverse tax legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities municipal funds carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities they also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible although statespecific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption generally municipal securities are not appropriate for taxadvantaged accounts such as iras and ks additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other

these risks before investing capital gains if any are taxable for federal and in most cases state purposes for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax income from federally taxexempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these and other factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the funds portfolio holdings you can lose money by investing in the fund credit qualities are shown as a percentage of net assets as of the date

any are taxable for federal and in most cases state purposes for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax income from federally taxexempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these and other factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in

any are taxable for federal and in most cases state purposes for some investors investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax income from federally taxexempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses taxexempt bonds may be issued under the internal revenue code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects as a result the funds investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund interest the fund receives might be taxable bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions changing market perceptions including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates changes in government intervention in the financial markets and factors related to a specific issuer or industry these and other factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in
