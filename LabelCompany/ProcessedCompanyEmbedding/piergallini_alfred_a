products co freed of nonperformers gerber reboundsexecutive interviewmay  by constance walker the morning callwe got in the car at the hospital  ill never forget this we were in cincinnati and the nurse handed my wife this kid our newborn daughter so im driving away and i looked at my wife and said now you know how to take care of this kid dont you she said i havent the slightest ideaalfred a piergallini a native of easton tells the story with a hearty laugh it seems incongruous that this man who admittedly once thought baby care was a genetic inheritance now runs the company that is synonymous with babies  gerber products copiergallini became chairman of the board chief executive officer and president of the michiganbased company at the turn of the year in  following david johnson who left to head campbell soup cothe food industry was not new to piergallini he had worked at sara lee corp and carnation co by then babies also were not new he has a yearold daughter and yearold sonnow the challenge was to continue what johnson started  helping gerber products gain back what it lost in the s because of overdiversification  and preparing the company for the future including expanding the product menu and the companys geographical reaches in the face of strong competition by corporation giants such as philip morris cos nestle sa and hj heinz coduring the last fiscal year which ended march  gerber had total sales of about  billion  food babycare items apparel and life insurance  and captured  percent of the total babyfood marketrecently while visiting easton area high school  where he graduated in   piergallini talked about changes in gerber products trends in the babycare industry and his philosophy of businessquestion what kind of trends are you experiencing in the babyfood industry and how does that play into gerbers planspiergallini our mission for the total company is in the feeding caring and clothing children from zero to about  years of age we want to dominate that category with gerber productsthe trends in our business are driven by birth rates the birth rate nationally is up about  percent about  million births a year give or take a fewwe entered the babyformula business about  months ago that came about because of our mission and that starts with the formula we believe breastfeeding is the best way to take care of babies but if you cant breast feed or in some cases women supplement breastfeeding we want you to try gerbera trend that negatively affected us is the early substitution of table foods when mom decides the kid should eat mashed potatoes and spaghettios but none of those foods are formulated for that age group research tells us mother uses that because its convenient but it has high sodium high fat and a lot of sugarso what were doing is trying to extend the consumption cycle by developing a toddler transitional food category  gerber graduates this would carry us from the monthold up to about  months we recently started rolling out the main meals  the first element in that toddler category were hopeful that by the end of this fiscal year well have a whole series under the gerber graduates name that might include snacks side dishes and juicestheres a big amount of consumption beyond  months that were not really taking advantage of now because when mothers give up baby food they give up usq how has the shift in environmental awareness affected gerberpiergallini the nutrition and environmental consciousness is all in our favor the trend in the us is going back to cloth diapers because of the environmental push we are the largest cloth diaper manufacturer in the united states the issue we are facing now is strong imports and they are tough to fight because of the price is so much lower  we make all of our diapers domesticallyweve got a great new diaper we just developed called the easy one for newborns its with velcro straps no pins were testing it in a number of hospitals but one thing we will never be able to beat in disposables  and they are a good product  is convenienceq is there a problem with marketing cloth diapers since the women having babies now probably have never used cloth diapers before and dont know howpiergallini most people dont know how to use cloth diapers theyd like to but they think its going to be really difficult and it isnt thats why weve recently come out with a diaper kit  two dozen diapers pins diaper liners vinyl pants diaper cover and a video tapethe tape shows how to take care of the baby but the whole idea was heres how you use cloth diapers heres how you fold them heres how you put them on the kid it even gives you the different folds for the girl and boy it costs about  but you go home open it up and you can do itq more and more

entrepreneurship your money new gerber president called sound manager by paul c judge special to the new york times published january   detroit jan — alfred a piergallini today was named president and chief executive of the gerber products company succeeding david w johnson who will take the top posts at the campbell soup company mr piergallini who had been chief operating officer has been with the babyfood concern for only nine months yet his relative inexperience is hardly a drawback at gerber where a thorough restructuring by the departing chief executive mr johnson changed the corporate culture and turned the company around in two years unlike his predecessor mr piergallini is largely unknown outside the company but has built a solid reputation managing gerbers operations thats what gerber needs right now a strong operations guy said kurt a feuerman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert renewed focus on baby food mr piergallini who is  years old inherits a company that is prospering a renewed focus on baby food pushed earnings up  percent to  million in the first six months of the  fiscal year analysts say gerber is on track to earn about  a share when its fiscal year ends in march compared with  last year mr piergallini joined gerber based in fremont mich after working for a variety of consumerproducts concerns most recently he was senior vice president of the carnation company he came to mr johnsons attention after expanding carnations market share in pet food when he was hired at gerber in april those familiar with the company expected him to succeed mr johnson eventually but the change in leadership came sooner than some had expected despite rumors that mr johnson was considering an offer from campbell mr piergallini who said his management philosophy is identical to mr johnsons will not tinker with the profit machine that mr johnson has created at gerber instead he emphasized his plans to follow through on the divestitures that began under mr johnson and said he hoped to squeeze even more profit from the baby food business through wider distribution and some new food products including a line of milkbased baby formula criticism of advertisements the american academy of pediatricians has criticized gerber for aiming at consumers rather than doctors with advertisements for its new line of baby formula which became available last summer the pediatricians have said gerbers advertising campaign undermines their efforts to encourage breastfeeding mr piergallini said the opposition to the marketing strategy has not appeared to adversely affect the introduction of our formula product the company is under pressure to establish its milkbased formula which is manufactured by the bristolmyers squibb company and sold by gerber under a joint agreement gerber tried to enter the market in  with a formula called modilac but it was discontinued in  the company expects profits from its new formula to be about  million to  million annually by  to accomplish that gerber will have to raise the price of the formula by  to  percent each year said william maguire an analyst for merrill lynch sale of daycare centers mr piergallini said his first job was to complete the sale of a national chain of daycare centers which he acknowledges will not realize any significant gain for gerber he also intends to follow through on the companys plans announced in november to close a baby food plant in niagara falls ontario some wall street analysts have alerted investors to sell their gerber shares believing that the company can go no higher without mr johnson as its guide but other analysts familiar with the company suggested that gerber still had potential to grow the simple fact that al piergallini is in charge does not reduce gerbers earnings mr maguire said gerber stock fell  cents yesterday to  in trading on the new york stock exchange photo alfred a piergallini the new president and chief executive of the gerber
