productsmanufacturers have a responsibility to make reasonably safe products for consumers but that’s not always the case the following are the most common reasons for defective productspoor manufacturing process defects in the manufacturing process are unfortunately a common occurrence a poorly made component — such as nails screws or clamps — can cause a product to completely fall apart while a tainted batch of a food or beverage item due to unclean facilities can make many people sickdangerous designs companies are sometimes too quick in introducing products to the marketplace overlooking major design flaws that put consumers at risk when these items do not function as they should serious injury may resultlack of proper warnings if a product has the potential to cause harm manufacturers have a responsibility to provide adequate warnings to consumers such as when companies sell items containing dangerous chemicals without notifying users about the potential hazardsfailure to recall sometimes companies know that their products are unsafe but the cost of conducting a full recall would be higher than any potential lawsuits in these cases it’s important to hold manufacturers accountable for their negligence — for both you and others who could also be injuredwhat is strict products liabilityin most cases your attorney needs to examine the reason why a product was defective in order to secure a verdict for a client however in strict products liability cases you and your attorney simply have to prove that a defective product injured you and reason behind the defect is irrelevant the goal of strict liability claims is to recover compensation for injuries and not to pursue punitive damages of any kind be sure to ask your boston lawyers about strict products liability and if it applies to your casespeak with an experienced product liability attorney in bostonno one expects to be injured by a defective product so be sure to work with a lawyer who knows these issues and can help you seek compensation from negligent parties and insurance companies the massachusetts attorneys feinberg  alban pc are passionate about helping injured
