condition and results of operations relates to ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership ferrellgas partners finance corp and ferrellgas finance corp have nominal assets do not conduct any operations and have no employees other than officers ferrellgas partners finance corp serves as coissuer and coobligor for debt securities of ferrellgas partners and ferrellgas finance corp serves as coissuer and coobligor for debt securities of the operating partnership accordingly and due to the reduced disclosure format a discussion of the results of operations liquidity and capital resources of ferrellgas partners finance corp and ferrellgas finance corp is not presented in this section the following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k the discussions set forth in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections generally refer to ferrellgas partners and its consolidated subsidiaries however in these discussions there exist two material differences between ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership those material differences are because ferrellgas partners has outstanding  million in aggregate principal amount of  senior notes due fiscal  the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness see the statements of earnings in their respective consolidated financial statements and note h  debt in the respective notes to their consolidated financial statements and ferrellgas partners issued common units during fiscal years   and  overview table of contents strategic diversification acquisitions during may  we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in each of sable environmental llc and sable swd  llc collectively sable a fluid logistics provider in the eagle ford shale region of south texas for consideration of  million subject to certain purchase price adjustments and contingent consideration consideration was paid in cash upon closing and a two year contingent consideration agreement was entered into entitling the sellers to additional cash consideration if the acquired business exceeds certain earnings targets the acquisition was funded through borrowings from our secured credit facility and subsequently sables ownership group purchased  million of our common units in a registered direct offering which units are subject to certain transfer restrictions with this acquisition we established a new operating and reportable segment referred to as our midstream operations with the acquisition of sable we have two reportable operating segments propane and related equipment sales and midstream operations during may  we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire one salt water disposal well dietert swd based in lasalle county texas during september  we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire two salt water disposal wells in the eagle ford shale region of south texas from ce production llc and its affiliates ce sellers based in bryan texas consideration was paid in cash upon closing with funds borrowed from our secured credit facility during september  in a nonbrokered registered direct offering which units are subject to certain transfer restrictions we issued to ferrell companies inc and the former equity holders of ce sellers an aggregate of  million common units for an aggregate purchase price of  million we used these proceeds to pay down a portion of the borrowings under our secured credit facility used to fund the acquisition discussed above as well as other propane and related equipment sales acquisitions completed during fiscal  propane and related equipment sales we believe we are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers in the united states we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the united states as measured by the volume of our retail sales in fiscal  and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase storage transport and sale of propane we enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time these commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately economically hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment moreover customers may not fulfill their purchase agreement due to the effects of warmer than normal weather customer conservation or other economic conditions our open financial derivative purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal  and  sales commitments and as of july   have experienced net mark to market gains of approximately  million because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment the resulting asset liability and related mark to market gains or losses are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as prepaid expenses and other current assets other assets net other current liabilities other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income loss respectively until settled upon settlement realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to cost of product soldpropane and other gas liquid sales in the consolidated statements of earnings as the underlying inventory is sold these financial derivative purchase commitment net gains are expected to be offset by decreased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception at july   we estimate  of currently open financial derivative purchase commitments the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts including swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate senior notes and our floating rate borrowings from both the secured credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility fluctuations in interest rates subject us to interest rate risk decreases in interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt while increases in interest rates subject us to the risk of increased interest expense related to our variable rate borrowings midstream operations table of contents volumes of salt water known as flowback and production water flowback is a water based solution that flows back to the surface during and after the completion of the hydraulic fracturing fracking process whereby large volumes of water sand and chemicals are injected under high pressures into rock formations to stimulate production flowback contains clays chemicals dissolved metal ions total dissolved solids and oilcondensate production water is salt water from underground formations that are brought to the surface during the normal course of oil or gas production because this water has been in contact with hydrocarbonbearing formations it contains some of the chemical characteristics of the formations and the hydrocarbons in the oil and gas fields we service these volumes of water are transported by truck away from the fields to salt water disposal wells where it is injected into underground geologic formations using highpressure pumps our revenue is derived from fees we charge our customers to dispose of salt water at our facilities and crude oil sales from our skimming oil process net earnings loss attributable to ferrellgas partners lp in fiscal  was a net earnings of  million as compared to  million in fiscal  this decrease was primarily due to a  million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the early extinguishment of all of our  million  fixed rate senior notes due october   and related interest rate swap termination a  million increase in operating expenses due primarily to the increase in propane sales volume a  million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to increased noncash stock based compensation charges a  million increase in noncash employee stock ownership plan compensation charge primarily due to the increase in per share value of ferrell companies shares allocated to employees and partially offset by the following a  million increase in gross margin  propane and other gas liquid sales due primarily to the increase in propane sales volume a  million increase in gross margin  other and a  million decrease in loss on disposal of assets we have completed our impairment test for the retail operations and products reporting units and

based upon the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on the information currently available to them in particular statements express or implied concerning our future operating results or our ability to generate sales income or cash flow are forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of performance you should not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking

of operations any such impairment may affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or pay interest on the principal of any of our debt securities in addition the trading price if any of our securities could decline as a result of any such impairment except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements or risk factors after the date of this annual report on form k in addition the classification of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership as partnerships for federal income tax purposes means that we do not generally pay federal income taxes we do however pay taxes on the income of our subsidiaries that are corporations we rely on a legal opinion from our counsel and not a ruling from the internal revenue service as to our proper classification for federal income tax purposes see the section entitled item a risk factors  tax risks the irs could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes or changes in federal or state laws could subject us to entitylevel taxation which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our

undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements or risk factors after the date of this quarterly report on form q table of contents recent developments in connection with the closing of our acquisition of bridger in june  bridger entered into a tenyear transportation and logistics agreement the jamex tla with jamex pursuant to which jamex would be responsible for certain payments to bridger and also for sourcing crude oil volumes for bridgers largest customer as a result of concerns regarding the collectability of amounts owed to bridger from jamex under the jamex tla and certain other matters between bridger and jamex on september   bridger jamex ferrellgas partners lp and certain other affiliated parties entered into a group of agreements that terminated the jamex tla facilitated ferrellgas purchasing certain ferrellgas common units from jamex and established payment terms for certain amounts owed by jamex to bridger under the jamex tla consequently ferrellgas does not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or ebitda from jamex or bridgers former largest customer in the future on september   bridger and ferrellgas entered into a termination settlement and release agreement the jamex termination agreement with jamex certain of jamexs affiliates and james ballengee the owner of jamex pursuant to which  jamex agreed to execute and deliver a secured promissory note in favor of bridger in original principal amount of  million the jamex secured promissory note in satisfaction of all obligations owed to bridger under the jamex tla  mr ballengee and bacchus capital trading llc an entity controlled by mr ballengee executed and delivered a joint guarantee of the jamex secured promissory note obligations up to a maximum aggregate amount of  million  the operating partnership agreed to provide jamex with a  million revolving secured working capital facility evidenced by a revolving promissory note the jamex revolving promissory note and together with the jamex secured promissory note the jamex notes  the other jamex entities agreed to execute and deliver a security agreement and a full guarantee of the obligations under the jamex notes  ferrellgas paid approximately  million to jamex and in return received  million of ferrellgas partners common units which were cancelled upon receipt and approximately  thousand barrels of crude oil  the parties agreed to terminate the jamex tla and certain other commercial agreements and arrangements between them and release any claims between or among them that may exist other than those arising under the jamex termination agreement or the other agreements entered into in connection with the jamex termination agreement and  ferrellgas waived the remaining lockup provision applicable to jamex under the registration rights agreement dated june   to which jamex is party the jamex secured promissory note originally had an annual interest rate of  which decreased to  as a result of ferrellgas reducing its quarterly distribution rate to  and contemplates quarterly amortizing principal payments together with payments of accrued interest the first quarterly interest payment of approximately  million was received in december  and the first quarterly principal payment of approximately  million was received in march  the maturity date of the jamex secured promissory note is december   and jamex may prepay the secured promissory note in whole or in part at any time the jamex revolving promissory note which provides jamex with access to working capital liquidity to meet their unrelated and ongoing crude oil marketing and other business needs has an annual interest rate of  which rate would be increased in case of a default and contains certain conditions precedent to the operating partnerships obligation to make any advances thereunder each borrowing under the jamex revolving promissory note must be repaid within  days and the ultimate maturity date of the jamex revolving promissory note is the earlier of september   and the date on which all obligations under the jamex secured promissory note are repaid the jamex secured promissory note is guaranteed pursuant to a guaranty agreement jointly by james ballengee and bacchus capital trading llc an entity controlled by mr ballengee up to a maximum aggregate amount of  million and each note is fully guaranteed pursuant to respective guaranty agreements by the other jamex entities the obligations of jamex and the other jamex entities under the notes are secured pursuant to a security agreement by a lien on certain of those entities assets actively traded marketable securities and cash which are held in a controlled account that can be seized by us in the event of default the sum of the amounts available under the controlled account and the  million guarantee approximate the  million note receivable as of april   table of contents during the year ended july   approximately  and  of bridgers gross margin and ebitda respectively was generated from its largest customer and jamex that customers supplier under takeorpay arrangements bridgers largest customer during the fiscal year ended july   owned a refinery in trainer pennsylvania bridger was party to an agreement with this customer under which bridger provided logistics services to transport crude oil from the bakken region in north dakota to the trainer refinery that agreement had a minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery for logistics services associated with the delivery of  mbblsd however if the quantity of crude oil delivered to the refinery dropped below  mbblsd the minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery would be suspended and jamex would become responsible for payments to bridger under the pay provisions of the jamex tla during february  jamex ceased sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery and since that time bridger had been billing jamex directly in accordance with the pay provisions of the jamex tla during july  we determined jamex would not resume sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery or be likely to continue to make payments under the pay provisions of the jamex tla as a result we negotiated a settlement with jamex and the jamex tla was terminated on september   while the agreement with the refinery owner was not terminated as a result of the execution and delivery of the jamex termination agreement bridger has been unable to negotiate a revised transportation and logistics agreement with that customer accordingly it is unlikely that bridger will continue to make any deliveries under the existing agreement consequently ferrellgas does not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or ebitda from jamex or bridgers former largest customer in the future additionally the continued sustained decline in crude oil prices and resulting decrease in crude oil production in the regions in which we operate continued to significantly impact our trucking and rail operations during the nine months ended april   a trend we anticipate will continue in fiscal  and beyond financial covenants the indenture governing the outstanding notes of ferrellgas partners and the agreements governing the operating partnerships indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries to among other things incur additional indebtedness and make distribution payments to our common unitholders our general partner believes that the most restrictive of these covenants are the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture governing the outstanding notes of ferrellgas partners and the consolidated leverage ratio and the consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility before a restricted payment as defined in the secured credit facility and the operating partnership indentures can be made by the operating partnership the operating partnership must be in compliance with the covenants under the secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility and in compliance with the covenants under the operating partnerships indentures if the operating partnership is unable to make restricted payments ferrellgas partners will not have the ability to make semiannual interest payments on its  million  unsecured senior notes due  or distributions to ferrellgas partners common unitholders if ferrellgas partners does not make interest payments on its unsecured notes that would constitute an event of default which would permit the acceleration of the indenture the accelerated indenture would become immediately due and payable which would in turn trigger cross acceleration of other debt if the payment of ferrellgas debt is accelerated ferrellgas may be unable to borrow sufficient funds to refinance debt in which case unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment before a restricted payment as defined in the ferrellgas partners indenture can be made by ferrellgas partners ferrellgas partners must be in compliance with the covenant under the ferrellgas partners indenture if ferrellgas partners is unable to make restricted payments ferrellgas partners will not have the ability to make distributions to ferrellgas partners common unitholders a breach of the financial covenants under the secured credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility will also result in an event of default under those facilities resulting in the operating partnerships inability to obtain funds under those facilities and give the lenders and receivables purchasers the right to accelerate the operating partnerships obligations under those facilities and to exercise remedies to collect the outstanding amounts under those facilities consolidated leverage ratio our consolidated leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing four quarters ebitda both as adjusted for certain specified items of the operating partnership as detailed in our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility during fiscal  our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility required the operating partnership to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than x as of each fiscal quarter end our consolidated leverage ratio was x as of july   which would have permitted approximately  million of additional borrowing capacity or approximately  million less ebitda as of the fiscal year end the narrow margin in this covenant was due primarily to several factors including higher debt caused by  a  million unpaid accounts receivable balance due from jamex at july    the  million purchase of  million common units from jamex in november   a  million purchase of  million of ferrellgas partners common units table of contents from jamex on september    bridgers growth capital expenditures of approximately  million and lower ebitda caused by  the warm weather in fiscal  which was  warmer than normal and  warmer than fiscal  which led to reduced demand for propane and  the decline in our water solutions business as a result of these factors and the jamex settlement discussed above on september   we entered into a fifth amendment to our secured credit facility and a fourth amendment to our accounts receivable securitization facility to modify our maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant during the quarter ended january   our results of operations were negatively impacted by sustained temperatures that were  warmer than normal throughout our operating areas in order to avoid a violation of both the fifth amendment to our secured credit facility and the fourth amendment to our accounts receivable credit facility ferrellgas partners sold in a private placement offering  million in aggregate principal amount of additional  unsecured senior notes due  at  of par net proceeds from the offering of approximately  million were contributed to the operating partnership which used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our secured credit facility as a result of the factors discussed above and the continued significantly warmer than normal temperatures during the quarter ended april   which were  warmer than normal throughout our operating area on april   we entered into a sixth amendment to our secured credit facility and a fifth amendment to our accounts receivable facility to modify our maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and our consolidated interest ratio covenant the amendment to our secured credit facility also  reduces the amounts available to be borrowed from  million to  million  increases the pricing of loans when our leverage ratio is greater than or equal to x from libor plus  to libor plus  and when our leverage ratio is greater than or equal to x from libor plus  to libor plus   limits the amount of distributions other than distributions to ferrellgas partners for payments of interest payable on its unsecured notes that the operating partnership may make to ferrellgas partners to  million per quarter ferrellgas partners current distribution rate is  million per quarter until the leverage ratio is less than x  reduces the amount of investments we can make when our leverage ratio is greater than x from  million to  million and  requires us to reduce our secured credit facility with  of the net cash proceeds received from any equity sale on april   the maximum consolidated leverage covenant was modified as follows maximum leverage ratio maximum leverage ratio date prior to amendments after amendments april     july     october     january     april     july    thereafter   our consolidated leverage ratio was x as of april   the margin allows for approximately  million of additional borrowing capacity or approximately  million less ebitda this covenant also restricts the operating partnerships ability to make payments to ferrellgas partners for purposes of funding quarterly common unit distributions as discussed above consolidated interest coverage ratio on april   the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio was modified as follows minimum consolidated
