achieve the returns they want — and need   our personal challenges are greater than ever   the cost of living is ever escalating whether it’s paying for a college education or just buying basic everyday items everything we need always seems to cost much more on top of this so much of what we earn goes directly to taxes   retirement today comes with its own unique set of challenges   longer

industry partnerships « previous article print  reprint  share advisor makes risk tolerance more meaningful july   • jerilyn klein bier necessity is often the mother of invention in financial services tolerisk a risk management tool created by a financial advisor and used by approximately  ria and hybrid firms is no exception when mark friedenthal left wall street to launch an ria firm eight years ago he knew he’d need to help his clients figure out the right amount of risk to take with their investments but he was disappointed by what he saw as simplistic onedimensional personality profiles “for me being a math guy being a cash flow guy i just couldn’t believe that in  advisors typically weren’t incorporating a client’s cash flows into advice as important as a risk directive” says friedenthal he put together his own spreadsheet model “the genesis of what became tolerisk” he says the product allows him to do a twodimensional risk assessment that combines a client’s personality profile and ability to take risk based on cash flow in late  a colleague at his firm friedenthal financial llc in voorhees nj built the model into a desktop application and added graphics that clients found very helpful in early  “a light bulb went off” that there was a wider industry need says friedenthal that’s when he started down the path of creating tolerisk the company he now runs as ceo friedenthal’s wife helped him write risk willingness questions “the running joke a few years back was ‘what do you get when a wall street risk manager marries a behavioral psychologist’” he says “a really nerdy software product called tolerisk” the firm works with outside developers and is a separate entity from friedenthal’s ria firm tolerisk beta tested its product in july  and launched it in december  the latest version  has the original core but its features functionality reporting and analytics have evolved dramatically says friedenthal “we’ve been so fortunate to work with amazing advisors who’ve really shaped it” he says and they continue to provide new ideas last year the product started incorporating mortality probabilities friedenthal’s biggest lesson learned was that the process of software development testing and approval requires an “excruciating” level of detail and “meticulous” documentation he declined to discuss development and marketing costs tolerisk’s web site lists half a dozen partners these organizations which aren’t compensated receive referral codes that offer their advisor clients a discounted rate for tolerisk’s product among them are charles schwab which lists tolerisk on its schwab openview marketsquare site and ria in a box a new yorkbased firm that helps advisors start ria firms and performs ongoing compliance “matching risk tolerance on an ongoing and pretty granular level as opposed to a lot of the generic stuff that exists out there is very appealing” says will bressman ceo of ria in a box “it’s an area that enhances the advisor relationship and enhances the overall compliance of a firm” tolerisk “built by someone who has lived and breathed the ria industry” says bressman “has good alignment with our vision for how an ria firm should operate” friedenthal was a client of ria in a box franklin banfer the president of asset planning group llc in johnstown pa began using tolerisk during client reviews in early  it has generated a lot of dialogue and “aha moments” he says the question becomes he notes “what am i more afraid of running out of money at age  or taking a little more risk and watching balances go up and down”   to read more stories  click here loading other articles loading other articles « previous article  comments login in order to post a comment quick poll whom would you like to see president
