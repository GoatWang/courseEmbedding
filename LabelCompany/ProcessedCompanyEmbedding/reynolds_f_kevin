of south hampton postdoctoral fellowship  university of washington  0 reynoldskpdxedu curriculum vitae research interests one of our major research areas is centered around microorganisms that produce secondary metabolites or natural products these compounds find widespread use including antibiotics immunosuppressants anticancer agents and antiparasitic agents the carbon skeleton core of many of these compounds are produced by polyketide synthases pkss we are studying these complex fascinating biosynthetic processes at both the genetic and enzymatic level a combination of genetic techniques including molecular breeding and in vivo recombination are being used to generate engineered microorganisms in which the natural biosynthetic process of interest has been diverted in some cases through the use of catalytically efficient hybrid pkss in combination with chemoenzymatic approaches and precursordirected mutasynthesis we are producing a wide range of new natural products with a variety of biological activities currently we are interested in the phoslactomycin plms and fostriecin compounds with antitumor and antifungal activity hygromycin a and pikromycin antibacterial activity and prodiginines compounds with interesting immunosuppressant antimalarial and antitumor activities we have been able to generate a library of more than 0 new phoslactomycins and are evaluating their biological activities we have also discovered that the prodiginines are orally effective in the treatment of malaria in mice we also study the primary metabolic pathways which provide the necessary precursors for assembling natural products we have shown that manipulation of these processes affect the ratio and yields of natural product in a fermentation process currently we are both deciphering the importance of competing precursor pathways in mutagenized industrial strains under fermentation conditions which produce high titers of the natural product we are also utilizing these strains as super hosts for heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic processes where fermentation yields from the native microorganism are a limiting factor our second area of research interests is the pathway of plant and bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis catalyzed by type ii fatty acid synthases fass the unique features of this pathway and of enzyme specific to this process have attracted considerable interest as both targets for both antibiotic development and biofuel production in bacteria and transgenic plants ketoacyl acp synthase iii kasiii initiates fatty acid biosynthesis in this process by catalyzing a condensation between an acyl coa and a malonyl acp substrate we are actively investigating different kasiii enzymes from staphylococci aureus escherichia coli and mycobacterium tuberculosis the organism that causes tuberculosis and plasmodial falciparum the parasite responsible for malaria we are using mutagenesis molecular modeling kinetic analyses and xray diffraction to probe the mechanism and varying substrate specificities of these enzymes we have crystallized and solved the structure of the m tuberculosis kasiii believed to play a critical role in initiating mycolate biosynthesis in this pathogenic microorganism we have designed and synthesized several series of selective synthetic kasiii inhibitors and are using techniques such as molecular modeling and xray crystallography with a long term goal of developing these into a new generation of antimalarial antibacterial and antituberculosis drugs representative publications

representative role within my region it was in these earlier roles that kevin established himself as a leader amongst his peers who respected the professional manner with which he conducted himself kevins initial district posed several leadership challenges that he confronted head on these included a history of poor performance and significant market events that impacted his primary products during this challenging time kevin demonstrated a bias for action aggressively managing performance and ultimately improving resultslater kevin was reassigned to the hartford ct district which was outside my span of control in that role he built upon his experience and realized even greater returns on his efforts earning the vice president’s club award in 00 kevin is a dynamic leader who is
