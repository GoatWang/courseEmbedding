messages directly to an existing can network in order to improve the range of vehicle control possibilities you can define up to eight different custom pages choosing among a wide library of page styles defining which data to be shown their end of scale and measure units here examples of pages with    or  different data the mxl display features a high contrast traditional lcd with a black to white ratio nearly double its predecessor fused with a graphical lcd offering great flexibility in information display and alerts the mxl now offers a dual colored backlight of high contrast white and red which can also be changed conditionally an ambient light sensor keeps the backlight at optimum brightness levels six different alarm leds you choose the conditions the colors and the flashing frequency you can configure them in order to turn them onoff depending on analog or digital inputs ecu values expansion values gps information or math channels you can also associate an alarm led a message and a digital output with each event mxl features two digital outputs the two digital outputs dout are low side type switch to ground they can be configured in order to be turned onoff depending on the value of the analog or digital inputs they permit to automatically run external systems ie to switch onoff additional lights to activatedeactivate a cooling fan or circulation pumps etc when a certain event happens more info an integrated shift light is a hallmark of the mxl but an even better  led shift light array is found in the mxl choose from a host of advanced multicolored rgb shift light patterns that can be customized to your liking and for each unique gear when required are you an mxl strada or pista owner connecting the mxl to your car is very easy you do not need to cable your car again just connect the specific adapter harness to your standard aim mxl harness and immediately exploit the huge potential of the newest mxl more info using the builtin can bus you can add expansion modules to the mxl to increment the performance and the data acquired gps module thanks to gps module included in the kit and its race studio  software you can immediately get laptimes and all data needed for engine tuning as well as for improving driving technique channel expansion it permits to add  volt analog channels for pressure temperature sensors and potentiometers two of these channels can be configured to receive digital inputs like wheel speed tc hub it adds  k thermocouples lcuone lambda controller wide band lambda controller lcuone with bosch lsu  probe providing all airfuel data lambda value and exhaust gas temperature allows to perfectly tune the carburetion smartycam hd cameras the onboard cameras that overlays on videos the data sampled by your logger memory module the memory module is a small sd card holder that can be connected via can bus to your aim logger in order to record the data during your tests connection examples race studio  is the heart of your mxl managing all your activities related to configuration with race studio  you can create modify delete import and export configurations with all channels ecu drivers math channels display pages digital outputs alarms shift lights and all the expansions you need you will also be able to manage the map of all your racing tracks and compare two laps watching the video recorded by smartycam hd cameras analysis with race studio  you can also analyse all data recorded by mxl and downloaded to your pc graphs histograms and tables will help you study your performance providing an objective support to avoid mistakes and improve performances aim learnfast etraining series check out how to use race studio  configuration part   part  configure calibrate and download your data
