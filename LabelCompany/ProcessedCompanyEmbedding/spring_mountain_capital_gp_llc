successfully represented john l steffens gregory p ho spring mountain capital gp llc spring mountain capital lp and spring mountain capital llc in a lawsuit brought by daniel and suzanne goldenson as well as two entities the goldensons controlled the lawsuit initiated in  in the united states district court in portland maine sought to hold the defendants responsible for the plaintiffs’ losses from the massive ponzi scheme perpetrated by bernard madoff it alleged breach of fiduciary duty fraudulent misrepresentation securities fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress after a tenday trial the jury unanimously concluded that the defendants who were also victims of madoff’s scheme had done nothing wrong and returned a verdict in their favor james kilbreth said it has been a long hardfought battle and we are thrilled with the jury’s recognition that our clients met their duties and obligations as investment professionals our clients have shown great perseverance and resolve throughout and fully deserved this vindication” steffens the former vicechair of merrill lynch  and ho started spring mountain capital in   its first investment fund was a fund of funds which pooled investors’ money and invested in over  funds  one of the funds spring mountain invested in was the ascot fund which was a madoff feeder fund  plaintiffs invested  million in spring mountain’s first fund and additional sums in other funds  overall the plaintiffs made  million on their investments in spring mountain funds  separately they invested  million in the ascot fund and lost approximately  million on this investment as a result of the madoff ponzi scheme  although ascot’s relationship with madoff was wellknown the lawsuit claimed that the defendants had failed to disclose ascot’s connection to madoff and were therefore responsible for the losses the plaintiffs incurred on their separate investment in ascot  the jury resoundingly rejected all the plaintiffs’ claims media coverage on august   attorney jamie kilbreth a member of drummond woodsum’s litigation group was quoted in the portland press herald article entitled bremen couple bilked by madoff lose case the article discusses a day federal jury trial in portland that ruled against a bremen couple who sued their financial adviser after he persuaded them to invest in a fund that was tied to infamous stockbroker bernie madoff “their claim was about losses in a fund that we didn’t manage” kilbreth said “their claim didn’t make any sense i think the jury felt that it the lawsuit was a way to blame someone for the madoff disaster” to read the article in its entirety please click here comments are closed related professional james t kilbreth related practice areas business  commercial litigation
