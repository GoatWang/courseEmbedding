investment fund inc presidents letter  february   fellow investors bcs financial services corporation on behalf of the board of trustees presents the  annual report for plan investment fund during  the administrative function for plan investment fund was successfully migrated to bcs financial services this change was made without any disruption to the participation certificate holders or the other service providers this successful transition was due in no small part to the efforts of the prior administrator health plans capital services corp and bcs financial services corporation i am happy to report also that plan investment fund experienced no problems related to the yk issue the investment advisors discuss later in the report the increase in short term rates and the impact on the portfolios rates have gone up as a result of the federal reserves actions this situation in conjunction with concerns about investor actions approaching the end of the century prompted both managers to shorten portfolio durations in spite of these factors the returns on the plan investment fund portfolios remained very competitive while maintaining very high credit quality during the past year average balances within plan investment fund have been below the levels of the prior two years this decline we believe is the result of reduced cash flows and decisions at some of the blue organizations to reallocate their investments there are presently  members of the blue system that use plan investment fund and we believe the wide usage of plan investment fund demonstrates that these portfolios provide a valuable investment alternative in many different situations we will continue to pursue ways to improve the value for investors while maintaining the high quality and

economy coupled with recoveries abroad put upward pressure on interest rates in the us markets during the past year the surge in growth as exemplified by a thirty year low in us unemployment and a  gain in third quarter gross domestic product gdp led to increased focus on the massive us current account deficit a weaker dollar and rising commodity prices higher prices particularly in the energy sector and tight labor markets caused concerns of profit margin compression for us corporations and negative sentiment in the bond market faced by strong economic reports and despite reassuringly low levels of inflation the federal open market committee fomc voted to increase shortterm interest rates three times in  raising the federal funds target from  in may to  in november the third tightening

worked well however throughout the quarter we saw rates rise roughly a  to  of a percent as the bond market completed a very tough year true to our discipline we kept the weighted average maturity of the portfolio in a defensive range considerably shorter than the benchmark we focused on preserving principal and took advantage of turn rates in high quality corporate and agency debt as they were extremely attractive through mid december careful security selection was rewarded as credit quality weakened in some sectors and corporate downgrades exceeded upgrades by the ratings services we avoided the longer maturities as it became clear that our economy continues to be robust consumer demand and confidence is strong and there could be more rate increases in the new year as the fed remains on inflation alert we have seen this pattern before the easy monetary policy during  was focused on the weak banking and savings and loan sectors the followup in  was a series of seven increases doubling the fed funds rate from  to  as you will recall in  the fed also capitulated later in the year as funds were reduced to  providing excellent returns to fixed income investors more recently we had the  successful fed action to head off an international financial crisis three rate reductions provided financial system liquidity and restored stability the reversal in  probably does not complete the feds work of tightening monetary policy enough to subdue the threat of inflation therefore the market has discounted some additional tightening to be accomplished sooner rather than

many financial products do not make life easy for any individual planning for retirement misselling of financial products by banks and other financial institutions has only doubled the customer’s confusion retirement has two phases – accumulation and distribution accumulation phase is the period where you accumulate the amount required for your needs post retirement distribution phase is where the accumulated corpus is distributed well to suffice the post retirement needs let us look into financial products for investment to build a strong portfolio for retirement construct a total return portfolio one common way to create retirement income is to construct your own portfolio of stock and bond index funds or work with a financial advisor who does this the portfolio is designed to achieve a respectable long term rate of return and along the way you follow a prescribed set of withdrawal rate rules that will typically allow you to take out  a year and in some years increase your withdrawal for inflationthe concept behind “total return” is that you are targeting a ten to twenty year average annual return that meets or exceeds your withdrawal rate although you are targeting a long term average in any one year your returns will deviate from that average quite a bit to follow this type of investment approach you must maintain a diversified allocation regardless of the yeartoyear ups and downs of the portfolio use retirement income funds retirement income funds are a specialized type of mutual fund they automatically allocate your money across a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds often by owning a selection of other mutual funds the investments are managed with the goal of producing monthly income which is distributed to you these funds are constructed to provide an allinone package that is designed to accomplish a particular objective immediate annuities all annuities are really a form of insurance rather than an investment i am including them on the best retirement investment list because their purpose is to produce income and that is what you need in retirementthere are fixed immediate annuities as well as variable immediate annuities some offer income that will increase with inflation although that means you’ll start out receiving a lower monthly amountyou can also choose the term of the annuity such as a ten year payout a joint life payout appropriate if you are married and want income for either of you that may be longlived or a single life payout buy bonds when you buy a bond you loan your money to either the government a corporation or a municipality the borrower agrees to pay you interest for a set amount of time and when the bond matures your principal is returned to you the interest income or yield you receive from a bond or from a bond fund can be a steady source of retirement incomebuy bonds for the income they produce andor for the guaranteed principal you will receive when they mature – don’t buy them expecting high returns or expecting to make a gain on capital appreciation  rental real estate rental property can provide a stable source of income but there will be maintenance requirements and when you own real estate you will inevitably incur unanticipated expenses before you buy rental property you need to calculate all the potential expenses you may incur over the expected time frame you think you will own the property you also need to factor in vacancy rates – no property will be rented  of the time variable annuity with a lifetime income rider a variable annuity is a completely different type of investment than an immediate annuity in a variable annuity your money goes into a portfolio of investments that you choose you participate in the gains and losses in those investments but for an additional fee you can add guarantees called riders think of a rider like an umbrella  you may not need it but it is there to protect you in a worstcase scenario keep some safe investments you always want to keep a portion of your retirement investments in safe alternatives the primary goal of any safe investment is to protect what you have rather than generate a high level of current incomei recommend all retirees have some type of reserve account an emergency fund this account should not be included as an asset available to produce retirement income it is there as a safety net something to turn to for unforeseen expenses that may come up in retirementin addition if you are not sure what to do with your money park it in a safe investment while you take the time to make an educated decision too many people rush to put their money into an investment because they feel like it should not be sitting in the bank for too long they end up making a hurried decision this is not a good idea income producing closedend funds the majority of closed end funds are designed to produce monthly or quarterly income this income can come from interest dividends covered calls or in some cases from a return of principal each fund has its own objective some own stocks others own bonds some write covered calls to generate income others use something called a dividend capture strategy be sure to do your research before buyingexperienced investors may find closed end funds to be an appropriate investment for a portion of their retirement money less experienced investors ought to avoid them or own them by using a portfolio manager who specializes in closed end funds  dividends and dividend income funds instead of buying individual stocks that pay dividends you can choose a dividend income fund which will own and manage dividend paying stocks for you dividends can provide a steady source of retirement income that may rise each year if companies increase their dividend payouts  but in bad times dividends can also be reduced or stopped all together real estate investment trusts reits a real estate investment trust or reit is like a mutual fund that owns real estate a team of professionals manage the property collect rent pay expenses collect a management fee for doing so and distribute the remaining income to you the investorreits may specialize in a certain type of property such as apartment buildings office buildings or hotelsmotels there are nonpublicly traded reits typically sold by a broker or registered representative who receives a commission as well as publicly traded reits which trade on a stock exchange and can be bought by anyone with a brokerage accountwhen used as part of a diversified portfolio reits can be an appropriate retirement investment due to the tax characteristics of the income reits generate it may be best to hold this type of investment inside a tax deferred retirement

finished product all ready to use in the real world actual investment portfolios you can hire us to manage your money according to any of our models andor asset allocation software so well do all of the rebalancing fund switches and all the usual maintenance for a flat  a month fee retired investors please consider the chim below before you get get stuck for life in a fixed annuity what investing models are model allocations are a very old investment strategy  probably even the oldest trick in the book you may know it as managing managers composites composite portfolios asset allocation funds or fund of funds fof other variations are in the text below theyre all the same thing regardless of how the words are mixed up model is the name given to something that represents a facsimile of the real thing for example a model airplane is designed to look like the real aircraft in this case investment portfolios that actual investors own in the real world look and act like the master investment portfolio models so if theres b of assets in a master model and you own  of it then youd have something small that looked and acted just like the real thing this way youre able to get similar results of the whole pie just by owning a slice the results will never be exactly the same just similar the only way an investor would own an exact investing model is if they initially bought all of the investment vehicles in the exact amounts on the first trading day the trades all settled the same day all distributions were reinvested they never made another trade other than the quarterly rebalancing and investment switches that occurred in the master model and all of these trades settled on the same day never put new money in never paid taxes on it and never redeemed shares none of that ever happens so model investment portfolios are never the real thing the actual results will be close and sometimes even better but never exactly the same as the master model portfolios even though they are not real model investment portfolios are very popular and helpful to get the point across for financial advisers theyre the oldest and mostcommonlyused standardized method of showing what actual investment portfolios would look like in terms of funding vehicles risk asset class mix income yields and what the historical performance has been if a preexisting investment portfolio a set mix of asset classes funded with specific investment vehicles exists before one invests in it then its a model portfolio if a unique personalized investment portfolio is created but did not exist beforehand then its not a model portfolio this image best sums up this investment strategy there are  versions of the regular portfolio models plus a dynamic target date retirement model and a  market timing calculator and backtester there are a total of  model allocations because fourteen have five investment risk tolerance categories conservative moderately conservative moderate moderately aggressive and aggressive then theres three conservative highincome models and one retirement target date model and one market timing model then the dynamic target date models information is here plus heres the investment calculator for modeling market timing strategies this doesnt count as an investor model but it uses the model allocations to backtest timing strategies the regular static passivelymanaged investment models are • five hybrid models using both mutual funds and etfs all returns are benchmarked from these and not the feebased models starting in jan  • five etf exchange traded funds models for both investors managing their own money and feebased advisers that like etfs • five feebased models are for investment advisors working on an investment management fee basis aka an ria using a feebased custodian platform here mutual funds with frontend loads are bought at nav net asset value or in english the initial sales charges on ashares are waived so the investor doesnt pay them • five all noload mutual fund models for diy investors managing their own money or investment advisors working on a feeonly basis without access to ashare mutual funds at nav • five benchmark index models these are used for comparing passive investment management with active investment management because they also serve as benchmark portfolios constructed specifically for this purpose the same asset classes and allocation weights as the other normal portfolio models with  asset classes are used but they are funded with benchmark indices they cannot be invested in like all of the other model portfolios and so they just serve as a point of reference for comparison purposes so model performance can be compared applestoapples after linking returns • five all frontend loaded mutual fund models for investment advisers working on a commission basis  all of the model portfolios above have their returns linked to account for switches rebalancings fees asset class weight changes etc so all returns since jan  or jan  are actual whereas all of the returns of the models below are hypothetical because they just show past returns using current funding vehicles which changed in the past the benchmark index models have actual returns without needing a spreadsheet to calculate them because there are no fees or switches but they are not rebalanced nor adjusted for past weight changes why because nobody does that like theyre supposed to when everyone is doing that then well do that too  • five index fund models for both investors managing their own money and feeonly professionals that like to use index funds these have two less asset classes than the regular portfolio models because there are no index funds for them yet  total all of the index mutual fund picks are noload under  minimum initial investment and there are no loadwaived funds so any investor can buy them so this is the asset allocation mix solution if you dont want to keep up with someone elses mutual fund picks and changes just index and rebalance because of yet another morningstar failure and lack of interest that hasnt been there for over a decade since etfs came out index funds are not screened and index fund models are not maintained anymore theyre still there but unless you say you want it refreshed its not updated anymore • two sets of investing models for  minimum accounts ten models total the same fiveinvestment risk tolerance categories use only  asset classes here this allows you to get the benefits of this passive investment management strategy with only  worth of either noload or frontend load mutual funds • two sets of investor models for  minimum accounts they have the same fiveinvestment risk tolerances and use eight asset classes this allows you to get the benefits of this static investing management strategy with only  worth of either noload or frontend load mutual funds • five asset allocator models made from the noload variable annuity discussed on this page their  subaccounts were optimized down to fifteen asset classes now feebased advisers can get their clients to exchange their vas into this and then charge them aum fees for managing it • five allocation models made from only american funds we optimized their  mutual funds down to nine asset classes • three hypothetical conservative highincome models aka chims for investors wanting to squeeze as much yield as possible out of a conservative mutual fund asset allocation its even more conservative than our conservative models the chims use normal mutual funds and etfs so there is nothing guaranteed nor insured about them whatsoever also because they have such a high allocation of fixed income their principle value will go down more than the other investing models when interest rates go up  even though allocations are more conservative than the regular conservative models read why you shouldnt fear fixed income mutual funds or etfs when interest rates increase if you have enough money in it then you can set it up so it completely eliminates account drawdowns this is because the total account value would only go down when the markets go down or interest rates go up the point of the chims are to make it so youll realize maximum income distributions to spend this makes it so you dont have to sell shares so if you dont sell shares and the markets dont go down then there are no drawdowns at all  just the opposite most of the time in normal times  when bonds actually yield something  like they will in a few years or so if interest rates keep going back up to normal premeltdown levels so the chims are sort of the magic solution to most all mundane concerns like this the chims are for retired or soon to be retired investors that just want to set everything up on autopilot and then ignore the outside world because you dont sell shares this makes all forms of fearbased news irrelevant and easier to ignore while getting a relatively safe yield in the  range and slowly growing as interest rates go back up so regardless of how scary the world is you just do nothing but make the monthly fund switches if any and just let it do its thing putting interest dividend and capital gains distributions into your checking account for you to spend the chim helps make it so you can do mostly nothing and get a big fat safe yield to spend so this is the opposite of what investors want if theyre prone to overreactions that makes them sell equity shares every time the news wants to scare them into buying gold theres a feebased chim and then the same thing was duplicated using all noload and all loaded mutual funds etfs were looked at too but none had better yields than mutual funds so project abandoned all of the text below is only for the feebased conservative highincome model yield is the combined distributions of an investment and is part of total return for a mutual fund its the combined dividends the fund takes realizes these are the taxable events which if you choose not to reinvest end up in your cash sweep or money market account mutual fund yields are calculated like this annual yield  dividends  nav  capital gains distributions the last months feebased chims income yield was  and the total return was  these are hypothetical because they dont account for past fund switches rebalancings or allocation changes this investing model is very different than the regular models because its goal is to maximize income yield not beat any benchmark index so the history of returns have are not maintained you can see the ytd and last three year returns on the investing model demo heres an estimate of how these numbers work out if youd invested  oneyear ago at the beginning of last month and the total return was  and the yield was  then now youd have  in cash to spend in your money market  cash  sweep account and in addition to that the fund would still be worth  because no shares needed to be sold to get the income yield this means you could sell all or any amount of the  at any time for any reason this is something you cannot do with cds real estate annuitized annuities limited partnerships large individual bonds private stock and options gold etc investors are also loathe to sell stocks and mutual funds when theyre down so you usually cannot do that either so right off the bat the chims high liquidity may literally save your life if you really really need your money then the number of mutual fund shares you owned would always be the same and so youd have  of income to report on your taxes assuming the mutual funds were not in a roth ira how much in taxes would vary as the composition of dividends capital gains and interest income would be random based on what the funds actually distributed this may not look like much but on average its twice the yield on all of our other investing models and even more compared to what most everyone else is getting this is because its another unique invention from t so nobody else has this it takes five to ten years for investors to catch on and start copying our work for example all roboadviser sites are basically offering the exact same things as our models so it took them from  to  to copy and automate our models they wanted to do it much sooner but the technology wasnt available yet some were even our customers that tried to get us to join their robo adventures around  the only difference is that robos charge rockbottom prices for their cookiecutting onesizefitsall nonpersonalized services running on insecure cloud servers whereas with ours its  secure mostly all custom work where the investor can have input on how their money is invested so if you look at the yields of everyone elses models including the robos then youll see that cloudbased automation still has years to go before it catches up with live money managers and if they do copy the chim then well sue big time for copyright infringement so the bottom line between our seminal investment models and copycat robo models are the returns and the fees keep checking the returns on these pages because this is one area where fintech wont win because our returns will most always be better even after our  annual aum fees for live clients with live accounts with our ca ria regardless of how fintech progresses one can never escape the mundane state of humanity  there aint no free lunch and in one way or another you get what you pay for theres more about robos below the table of returns the most important thing is this if you set it up and manage it correctly the number of mutual fund shares you owned will most always be the same after you get paid your retirement income paycheck as it was before you got paid good luck trying to find something that performs this function with these returns and low risk for this price then in jan  the sec started saying theyre going to put more resources into regulating robos too so the free lunch may be coming to an end sooner than you think what this will do for example the yield on the optimized conservative american funds model was only  and the last months return was  and this does not account for the sales loads so if you had a million bucks in the conservative american funds model your monthly retirement paycheck from just yield would only be  with the feebased chim it would have been  so this resulted in having  more retirement paycheck compared to investing the obsolete s american way so in order to receive the same amount of retirement check with american funds youd have to constantly sell shares this will probably make your nest egg run out before you pass away with the chim you probably wouldnt need to sell shares to get a decent yield and retirement paycheck so when you pass away theres a better chance that youd still have around your original million bucks intact even worse if you gave your million dollar nest egg to a life insurance company in exchange for the usual plain vanilla fixed annuity not only would you probably realize even less retirement income than with american funds  less it wouldnt even keep up with cost of living inflation at all unless you paid the insurance premiums for an inflation rider then youd get about  less paycheck than by using american funds then when you pass away your heirs would receive nada bupkiss el zilcho unless you paid the insurance premium to provide a death benefit then youd get about  less paycheck than with american funds so if you combine the cost of these two needed insurance contracts to insure for these two huge risks which are  certain to happen youre making around  to  less spendable income in a fixed annuity than with american funds so this adds up to be around  to  less retirement income paycheck than the chim would probably provide over your retirement years this is why all of this boring stuff matters and why you need to wake up and pay attention asap to whats really going on in life and not just what a salesperson is feeding just you to get their huge immediate commissions one also must factor in risk and total return when considering how high or low yield is this models income is extremely high considering the low risk because of the extreme diversification and low equity exposure and relatively high total return taking that into account this compromise between high yield lowrisk and high total return is better than anything else weve ever seen if someone has a better investment strategy to get higher yields with less risk then wed be doing that too these yields were a lot higher in  but after banning fund families that abuse leverage and derivatives play shenanigans and other tricks that make the fixedincome parts of the portfolio not be conservative eg pimco its down the bright side of that is that the yields are much more stable the funds are a lot more conservative shenanigans by the funds are mostly eliminated and thus are more suitable for retired investors this is as good as it gets and is ideal for investors that dont want to sell shares to raise money to spend on living expenses if you do your research youll see its extremely difficult to get this rate of income without selling anything all while realizing lowrisk good returns and the other advantages of using only openended mutual funds low costs extreme diversification liquidity transparency etc if youre retired and need money from an investment portfolio to live off of then this may help make it last a lot longer this is because the more income distributions a portfolio sheds without selling shares the fewer shares youll need to sell to get the paycheck you need and the fewer shares you sell the more money youre going to have later also the more conservatively a portfolio is constructed the longer it will last too especially when the markets are down once you sell shares they do not just magically grow back if youre spending all of the distributions instead of reinvesting them which is what youll do with this model portfolio in other words if you spend the income the only way to have more shares is to invest more money capital gains taxes are also kept to a minimum when you dont redeem shares for income theres no profits to report if you dont sell and realize any gains youll be realizing and spending the internal realized capital gains distributions though so two of the main tricks to not run out of money when you reach an advanced age is to not sell shares and never invest in any form of selfdestructing bonds or these types of bond etfs or mutual funds as explained in the free money ebook while on the subject heres the way we like to think about the value of paying an advisor to construct an investment portfolio for the purpose of producing a sustainable retirement paycheck take the total amount of their fees expenses and commissions and divide that by the amount of income realized over the past year dont count share sales as income just dividends and capital gains distributions if its more than  then youd probably do a better job of managing your money yourself using our chim youd probably get a higher yield with a higher overall rate of return with less risk youd end up selling many less shares worrying about trust ethics security and privacy issues would be history and youd save all of their fees and commissions  forever for example if you have a m portfolio pay  in fees and are getting  income without selling shares then youre paying  of your income in fees more than  and we think youd be better off doing it yourself and not paying any of their fees anymore more than likely youve only been getting  income yield and theyve been selling shares so this would yield  of your income going to pay the advisor this is way too high so diy also the chim is just about the only thing you can just buy read the directions and use that will help you set up and manage tiny endowmentlike funds as long as your average spending yield is lower than the chims average yield then that will perform this function  without having to hire actuaries or a team of expensive investment advisors that specialize in endowment fund investing in other words the chim is the money tool that does this job as close as you can get without spending real money on the project download this word docx that explains why all of this is so critical these days also while on the subject why fixed annuities are not the answer when it comes to getting a retirement paycheck from your nest egg and why you shouldnt fear buying bond mutual funds when you think interest rates are about to go up theres more math and evidence that this is the best way to get retirement income on the fixed annuity page click the link above the asset allocation models include • all of the  model allocations described above • the mutual fund picks spreadsheet for all  asset classes these portfolio models only use  asset classes the other five asset classes are for use with the comprehensive asset allocator software theres  mutual fund recommendations times five ways of managing money totaling over  monthlyupdated investment recommendations to keep everything updated and balanced you can also subscribe to keep these models andor just the mutual fund recommendations fresh on a monthly basis youll receive the reasons for all switches to decide whether or not to sell the old mutual fund and buy the new one • sometimes theres a short investment newsletter for subscribers explaining what happened over the last month regarding the models mutual fund selections generic site information and sometimes market commentary • a sheet for inputting a comparison portfolio this has two purposes first it allows for quick and easy rebalancing of actual portfolios compared with one of the models of your choice this shows how much the actual allocation mix is off by both in percentage and dollar amounts this tells you exactly how much to buy or sell in each asset class with tickers to bring the portfolio back into balance then you can compare the asset allocations the returns and the differences in returns between the model allocations and the actual portfolio held there is also a matrix of these returns and the differences between the actual investment portfolio it also displays past portfolio returns and the asset allocation mix of the comparison  actual portfolio some of this can be seen on the demo • over  charts graphically show all of the asset allocations and the actual  comparison model portfolio • five html files that may help you use model asset allocations with k plans once you buy the models or have the free money ebook youll also get stepbystep directions on how to better allocate a k plan by yourself • three spreadsheets showing the linked returns and mutual fund switches since inception for the feebased since  and the noload and load models since  linking returns uses the time weighted methodology and is the standard used in accounting for past trades when calculating historical investment performance you can use all three of these spreadsheets to audit the returns yourself about this and how the returns are calculated are in the directions other information • if you use a thirdparty money manager and they charge bps then for every million you have with them youre giving up  a year of gross income our investing system allows you to keep all of your money while most likely realizing better returns with less risk • the most valuable feature is that this system allows you to create investment portfolios that are ready to be implemented in the real world this is called a turnkey system what this means is that all you have to do is insert the key buy it then turn the crank read the directions and the machine spits out the finished product all ready to use in the real world your portfolio we use morningstar for their mutual fund database to pick the mutual funds every month and thats all it costs  a year and they raise their prices  every year our investing software gives you both a great investment strategy and the funding vehicle recommendations but doesnt have this vast database needed to evaluate strategies nor the investment vehicles used so advisors may need both if they want to use our models as a framework to create other models but if you dont want to do that or if youre a diy investor then you wont even need morningstar if you have our system because everything is already done for you so this turnkey money management system makes it so you wont need to buy or use any other investment software • all mutual fund asset allocations display their last months income yield except the benchmark index allocation models which dont have yields • the portfolio models mutual fund selections and all of the portfolio returns are updated and sent out to subscribers around two days after the first trading day of each month yes this used to be midmonth but we had to migrate to morningstars aws so the big advantage there is being able to update on the first trading day of the month now • advisers can input their own fees and trading cost numbers into the feebased models linked returns spreadsheet to see how the returns change • these same asset allocation model concepts can also be used with variable annuities variable life insurance vul k    bs  plans and with just one mutual fund family like we do for american funds or using as many fund families as you want • most investment managers models do not account for past trades so the actual returns investors realize are usually  to  less than whats advertised via their hypothetical returns the only way to see how well a strategy is really doing is to run the actual numbers you can see these differences using our aggressive feebased model on the chart of comparison returns on the main asset allocation primer page this is explained in detail in the directions using the table of historical investment model returns first the feebased models are old news and the hybrid models are the latest and greatest thing starting january  everything is being benched from the hybrid models so if youre a money manager dont use and ignore the returns of the feebased models the only reason for using the feebased models going forward is if youre a financial adviser and for whatever reason you dont want to use etfs investors should use the either the hybrid models etf models or the noload models in that order  if you want what investing models do  which is give you extreme diversification to minimize risks next if youre comparing performance to another nott model then you should know that the chances that their returns have been linked to account for past investment vehicle changes rebalancings and asset class weight changes are slim to none and slim left town so once youre sure they have just been using past returns from their current hot picks instead of properly accounting for for their losing picks along the way then do not use returns below that are linked use the hypo returns below that have not been linked this way you are comparing applestoapples and not something that looks good because its fake compared to something that is real if theres returns on our site for only than three years then they are not linked other than the hybrid models only sets of returns showing five years or more have been linked we know that  of all money managers returns have not been linked because we tried to offer that as a service to advisers its a lot of work so its a lot of money so nobody ever did that ones weve talked with in person had zero stomach for paying over  to shine the spotlight of truth onto their work  even if it looked like theyve been outperforming their competition if so then that  paid to us to do the work would have been returned to them many times over because they can use that to easily take accounts away from their competition so its yet another example of financial advisors being penny wise and pound foolish so the bottom line is that is very rare that any return you see from a diversified investment portfolio of any kind is actual so the standard language used to describe portfolio returns that are not linked is hypothetical the point is that hypo returns can be several times greater than actual returns as you can see by comparing both from the same portfolio models below so the bottom line is to only compared hypo to hypo and actual to actual since only  of money managers maintain actual returns youll be comparing hypo to hypo most all of the time the table below shows the actual returns for the feebased model portfolios they are actual and not hypothetical as shown in the demo these are the actual returns from inception  january  showing the returns as if you initially bought all of the investment vehicles in the exact amounts on the first trading day the trades all magically settled the same day all distributions were reinvested you never made another trade other than the monthly rebalancing and investment switches that occurred in the master model and all of these trades settled on the same day never put new money in never paid taxes on it and never redeemed shares compare these results to what you or your advisors have been getting they are probably much better why because buyandhold passive asset allocation strategies work better than stock or etf picking or market timing when you think about it thats all there is to do there is nothing else other than speculating with derivatives or buying life insurance company products all of this is just that simple read a summary or go here or here or here or here for more details the great debate thats been going on since the beginning of time is finally over can active investment management ever consistently profit more than passive management after expenses these investing models are proof that active management works and the cost is so low that its almost insignificant as long as you dont try to pick stocks  etfs andor time markets with the investing models and use mutual funds that even slightly outperform their asset classes you can sometimes beat the markets while being extremely diversified but not always  nowadays etfs are the tail that wag the market dog so nobody is beating the markets anymore the returns shown below are also not due to luck they are very consistent over the time weve been tracking them  but the history of trades was not recorded until  there have been only a couple dozen months out of  when the moderate index model beat the feebased moderate or aggressive model if these returns were due to luck then it would have been around half of the time you can see the current hypothetical numbers compared to the index model by looking at the demos charts also the actual performance for the feebased moderate or aggressive model compared to the index model is on the table of historical investing returns here on the demo screen print you can also see all of the current relevant portfolio statistics like alpha beta standard deviation etc these came from the asset allocation software and are not part of the investing models see a table of asset class returns on the mutual fund picks page that show how and why correlation coefficients of asset allocation work so well all of this is aka modern portfolio theory or mpt the most real world thing to do when looking at the table below is to compare the moderate or aggressive model or the feebased moderate model portfolio when markets are down with the sp  over the various time frames the longer the time frame the more meaningful the comparisons are the returns are after all mutual fund fees and expenses eg bs are taken into account but they dont account for annual management fees that a professional investment advisor would charge a client this is because those are estimated and accounted for on the three links here see the table of returns assuming you charge your clients  annual management fees low see the table of returns assuming you charge your clients  annual management fees average see the

nasdaq russell  msci eafe barclays  sp us aggregate bond more about roboadvisers the longterm failure with robos will be caused by the shortterm success of their one and only assetgathering magic trick  rockbottom fees this is all they have  the fintech that automatically invests your money via a cookiecutter asset allocation mix one person like me gave their models to a coder and they made it so when money hits the account the algorithm automatically invests into a model portfolio because the money manager doesnt have to manually care for the money they only have to do the work once instead of several times a day this is how they lower their expenses and seem to make everything magically happen for free theres too many problems to list with this  are they swapping old vehicles for new ones efficiently are they any good at that are they rebalancing when what are their triggers and ranges and at what level are they any good at that how are they maintaining the asset class weights and are they using market timing to do that are they any good at that are they using both mutual funds and etfs  which are now required to be competitive using both all mutual funds or all etfs is a recipe for subpar investment performance are they any good at that do they know when to use a fund or an etf are they any good at that are they adequately maintaining their compliance and legal requirements are they any good at that thats very expensive so probably not so its just a matter of time before all of those chickens come home to roost the answers will be in their returns which so far are just similar to our index fund models which are bad when compared to our actively managed model allocations you get what you pay for and know it or not youre paying for good returns while getting adequate risk reduction via diversification no market timing and good vehicle selection and allocations that can only be so good for so long when the people doing the highvalue work are being paid rock bottomrobo wages then its not just people at the robo firm being underpaid  their business models dictates that everyone involved in the process work in the race to the bottom rockbottomlowpricing world so its only a matter of time before their relationship with their vendors breaks too because eventually theyre going to wake up and want to be paid enough money to survive too the deal with enticing investors with uberlow fees is that the very few people with brain cells working there havent been paid are not getting paid now and they wont be getting reasonably paid in the future  ever so sure it may look spiffy and seem like a good deal now but eventually the money managers maintaining the asset allocations will get a grip on the reality that their paycheck will always be a small fraction of what they can earn just about anywhere else andor by starting their own firm and theyll quit then theyll be replaced by lesser and lesser qualified money managers every time this happens then most robos offer no control and some think thats good by making their program not allow you to sell when the market goes down only they know if it will prevent you from buying when the market goes up too a few market downturns ago probably brexit betterment wouldnt allow you to sell anything at all until they felt the irrational panic was over while typing about betterment  we were sort of involved in the whole process in  when tony robbins was deciding which way to go with the robo thing he considered us according to our middleman so i did the math on that everything seemed like it was a good deal for him tony the other owners lowlevel employees and investors but when i took expected gross income minus expenses including the lowlevel employees to get net income  and then divided that by the number of highvalue employees it turned out that theyre making about  a year the point is thats about one quarter of what someone at that level could make if they got a job on wall street andor started their own firm so the bottom line is its only a matter of time before the people that perform the most important functions at betterment realize the honeymoon is over they wake up and quit for more compensation another point is this is the exact same situation that all robos advisers are in so look for changes there in a few years in the form of much higher aum fees end of the betterment digression this is sort of the same as hiring a normal money manager with full discretion which means they can do whatever they want with your money anytime they want without telling you but within boundaries but there you can always tell them what to do and they do it andor what to not do robos will just tell you no give you no control and then if their magic algorithm makes a market timing mistake then a bazillion times more money could be lost than youve saved in fees also just wait for their algorithm to fail just like all code does and make millions of erroneous trades which cannot be undone or they get hacked and load up on pork bellies just for fun without paying humans good money to constantly keep an eye on things anything and everything can and will eventually go wrong that was the first and most important thing the old portfolio manager told me as i was replacing him in   you always have to check doublecheck and triplecheck everyones work every time or there will be a very expensive timeconsuming and unfixable failure so when your minimal staff is minimally compensated to keep the fees rockbottom that opens the door to too many potential failures to type about here if i was the head of the sec id put a blanket ban on all forms of robos just for this reason alone one of the most probable things the sec will do is make them add human staff until the point is reached where they feel robos are safe the point is hiring all of those people will make their fees go up which will make the highvalue people quit because of the added annoyances combined with the fact that if they are any good then they could be making five to tens times more down the street this will lower returns increase risk and make them much less competetive compared to human money managers when the free lunch starts to taste not so good then they will go away so eventually each one will selfimplode with neglect mistakes failures then the regulators will add uberexpenses to their deals if they dont just kill off the whole deal entirely which is what some say they want  and all of this will show in their afterexpense returns then investors will start to bail when they see there really is no free lunch and you get what you pay for they have have realized a bargain for a few years but then their afterfee returns will be less than hiring a real world asset manager and theyll return to them en mass so in a few years robo investors will flee en mass and return to what works best for everyone longterm  diy or hiring actual handson money managers especially when the sec gets through with them making them spend big money staying compliant  thus raising their expenses and then their fees will go back up to levels where it makes no sense anymore  because their one and only magic trick will be gone forever if the government doesnt change kill off or make the whole business model not work for another long list of reasons over the next year or so articles about robos and the upcoming sec clampdown these investor models and the comprehensive asset allocation software are two different programs with different pricing tables so the most frequently asked question is whats the difference between the asset allocation software and these asset allocation models with the asset allocation software unlike allocation models which exist before someone is around to invest in them the investor submits various life factors needed to calculate a custom allocation mix that reflects their life situation so its not just using one of a few generic preexisting model allocations theres dozens of asset class mix combinations model portfolios only take one life factor into account  investment risk tolerance category this is determined by filling out and scoring an investment fact finder theres littletono work involved youd just determine risk tolerance allocate money according to the models asset class weights and then make the trades the comprehensive asset allocation calculator also takes risk tolerance into account as the most important factor in determining the mix but it also uses a few more life factors with the asset allocation calculator the currentlyheld investment mix is then compared to the recommended mix of asset classes then investments are shuffled around to create the proposed mix the new investment recommendations aka proposed snapshot it then displays current and proposed snapshots that can be analyzed and compared then future projections can be made given various assumptions this allows complete control over most every aspect of the asset allocation process model portfolios only show investment recommendations the proposed snapshot and mostly ignores the currentlyheld investment portfolio so with the comprehensive asset allocation software theres work involved in creating an investment portfolio thats custom tailored to fit the investors life this makes it best suited for larger clients that are paying an advisor enough to make it worth doing the extra work or doing it yourself our regular portfolio models only use  asset classes and the asset allocation calculator accommodates an unlimited amount we screen mutual fund asset classes for  the models have less asset classes to minimize the amount of money needed to buy everything its currently around k to buy the feebased moderate model less for the other four allocations because they dont use every asset class plus theres also k and k models for that you dont subscribe to the allocation software because it doesnt change monthly youd only subscribe to the mutual fund selections to keep the funding vehicles current its best to subscribe to the models to keep portfolios updated with both fresh funding vehicles and allocation changes for diy investors the choice of using the investing models or the asset allocation software shouldnt be governed by how much money you have it just should depend on how much time and work youre willing to put into matching your portfolios to your life using the portfolio models is fast easy and simple once you know your risk tolerance category everything is done except making the trades the asset allocation calculator is complex and will take an extra hour to create your investment portfolio but it will match your life better how to get
