design targets upfront global automotive manufacturers face increasing pressure from government regulations and consumers to improve the efficiency of their products and reduce particulate and greenhouse gas emissions this is driving the need for diesel electric and hybrid power trains continuous improvement in aerodynamic efficiency and reductions in vehicle weight consumers demand improved quality and durability — without any compromise to innovative and emotionally expressive designs manufacturers must offer a broader array of vehicles for different niche customer segments and geographies with wider ranges of operating conditions on a faster design refresh schedule than in the past powerflow external aerodynamic simulation of these bmw vehicles demonstrate transient visualization of wake structures   ​​animations of powerflow external aerodynamic simulation of these bmw vehicles demonstrate transient visualization of wake structures visualizing and sharing this information along with drag  lift data across departments helps engineers to develop efficient vehicles while maintaining attractive styling images courtesy of bmw ag these goals often conflict requiring automotive manufacturers to make careful tradeoffs of competing values thus the automotive designer’s task is not to create the most attractive fastest quietest or fuelefficient car but rather a car that sufficiently satisfies the design preferences and functional and quality expectations of its target customer offers fuel efficiency within a desired target range and can be brought to market on time at an acceptable profit this need to optimize the balance of industrial design performance factors cost and process efficiencies is a continual challenge for the automotive industry the old methods of product development are no longer sufficient building prototypes to test performance and assess quality is not only very expensive but the engineering team needs to understand the design tradeoffs very early in the product development process — months or years before any prototype could be built simulationdriven design not only provides feedback earlier and in a more useful form than traditional approaches but in many areas simulation has reached a level of accuracy and robustness that is sufficient to enable a manufacturer to rely solely on simulation results for design decisions and tooling signoff without prototype testing many of these design challenges including aerodynamics thermal management noise and cabin comfort are heavily influenced by the complex fluid flows over and through the vehicle exa has the solution exa powerflow’s unique inherently transient lattice boltzmannbased physics enables it to perform simulations that accurately predict realworld transient conditions on the most complex geometry powerflow imports fully detailed vehicle geometry and accurately and efficiently performs transient aerodynamic aeroacoustic and thermal management simulations exa’s solutions enable you to rapidly create evaluate and propose alternative designs that meet all the requirements using the powerflow suite you can evaluate product performance early in the design process — when change has the smallest impact on both the design process and engineering budget powerflow applications have been fully validated and are in deep productive use at many of the world’s premier automotive manufacturers applications overview exa offers solutions for the following automotive applications aerodynamics — aerodynamic efficiency drag handling driving dynamics
