you knowthere has perhaps never been a better tool for doityourself home handymen than the internet with detailed instructions and videos explaining how to perform a number of common maintenance and renovation tasks around a house an untrained homeowner might be surprised at how much he or she can accomplish with a quick search online but even with all of this information there are still many jobs that lie far outside the scope of most diy enthusiasts general contractors are there to fill in this gapa general contractor specializes in seeing a home remodel or repair project through from start to finish to do this the contractor works with the client  whether they are a homeowner or business  to nail down the scope of the work then he or she will turn to one or more subcontractors for specific tasks like equipment operation design electrical work or whatever else is neededin essence general contractors could be thought of as middlemen between a homeowner or business owner and any number of specialists to get their moneys worth many assume they should just cut out the middleman and hire specialists directly but this often proves more difficult in practice general contractors wont be completing an entire project by themselves but should have a long list of dependable experts who can work together and accomplish any task they might also serve as the manager on the site of a construction project overseeing workers and providing guidance and assistance when needed for larger projects though the contractor might only handle administrative matters and employ a foreman or other professional for onsite supervisioncommon jobsthere are many general contractors who also specialize in certain tasks themselves there is usually at least one general contractor on hand to organize the construction of an entire home for example but general contractors could also help a homeowner add an additional bedroom build an inground pool or complete a major landscaping project they could also work with a business to add or improve office space whether that means making more room or converting a commercial building from a nail salon to a restaurant basically if its a job that involves building or repairing a general contractor probably knows how to get it doneno matter what the exact job may be a contractor will probably need to accomplish several other essential tasks in pursuit of the ultimate goal which may includeunderstanding and applying for building permits to meet local regulationsorganizing a budget and adhering to it throughout the projectgathering all the necessary tools and equipment from hammers and shovels to large excavators and generatorssecuring the construction site and equipment after work hoursworking with personnel onsite to address any issueskeeping records of materials labor and all other expenseslicensingevery general contractor performing any kind of work on a project must be licensed to do so in their state the guidelines for the specifics on licensing vary from state to state some states might only require registration of contractors which is different from licensing registration typically means that there must be a written record of what work is being performed and by whom but it does not guarantee professional knowledge licensing on the other hand involves an examination process to assess professional competencewhether your state requires licensing or registration of contractors there should be a record of most professionals willing to complete certain projects in your area check your state or county website for more information in states that require licensing every licensed contractors contact information is available online or from another public sourcenot every project needs to be completed by a licensed or registered contractor if its just a minor job that wont take more than a day or two and will cost less than a few hundred dollars its likely not necessary to find a licensed or registered contractor however anything bigger or more expensive or a project involving plumbing or electrical work needs to be completed by a licensed or registered professionalgeneral contractors also must be covered by an insurance policy this should include liability coverage for any property damage that could be inflicted in the course of a job it should also include a workers compensation policy in case anyone is injured on the job before hiring a contractor for anything ask for written proof of this insurance to see exactly what is covered trade associationsa number of trade associations for contractors in the us exist some of the biggest includeassociated general contractors of america represents more than  general contracting firms and more than  specialty contractors nationwideassociated builders and contractors represents nonunion contracting firmsmost trade associations for general contractors will provide references for anyone looking to hire a contractor for a specific project they may also provide a number of benefits for their members including assistance with licensing training insurance and business developmenthiring a general contractorno matter what you need accomplished you want to choose a contractor who can get the job done right at a reasonable price obviously this is easier said than done but there are a few steps you can take to ensure you find a trustworthy general contractorfinding general contractorsthe first and perhaps most reliable way to find a general contractor is to ask friends and family members for a recommendation if you know anyone who has had major work done on their home particularly if its a similar job ask them who they hired and if they were pleased with the result you could also ask neighbors about who theyve hired if you notice work being done on their house many remodeling contractors post signs in front of homes to advertise their services as a general rule its rarely a good idea to hire a contractor who solicits work by going door to doorif you are considering hiring a contractor without a personal recommendation ask the contractor for references from past clients and do as much background research on them as possible look for any complaints or compliments online to get a better idea of their track record there are a number of websites specializing in connecting contractors with people or businesses who need work done these sites may also allow past clients to submit their own reviews of the contractor budgetbefore hiring a contractor make sure you are both in agreement on the projects budget its normal for most contractors to charge clients a premium not only for the labor expenses and zoning expertise but for acquiring the materials as well be as clear and concise as possible regarding what youll be purchasing yourself and what you will be paying the contractor to complete homeowners may be able to find a better deal on raw materials when they purchase these directly but they first need to be sure they arent buying the wrong thingsdont forget to discuss how the project will be finalized and what will be done about cleanup plans for how the work site will be cleaned at the end of each day as well as at the conclusion of work need to be put in writing an experienced general contractor should make every effort to keep the workspace clean and prevent dirtying or damaging any other area even so talk with the contractor about the daily schedule the logistics of transporting workers and equipment and how cleanup will be handledprioritizing safetyas previously mentioned you need to make sure to follow any state and local regulations regarding construction work which includes hiring a licensed or registered general contractor ask the contractor for proof of their certification before signing anything as well as their proof of insurance you should also check your homeowners insurance policy to see if they offer coverage for contracted work you may want to call your insurance provider and ask for more details on what your plan will and wont coverperhaps the best way to feel safe about a contractor and the work being done is to hire a contractor you trust this is why relying on personal references from friends and family is so important and will often provide a great deal of peace of mind if you arent able to obtain a reference work to conduct extensive research on the contractor as well as the work you are hiring them to perform this should bring everyones expectations into alignment and result in a safe work environmentfinancial safetybefore any money changes hands there should be a contract to sign make sure the specifics of the work to be done and all costs are listed in the contract right down to the most precise details if you forget to have something included in the contract after signing it theres rarely a chance of recourse once the specifics of the job are nailed down be sure to discuss the payment schedule with the contractor this is important because paying too much up front offers the homeowner minimal leverage if the quality of work does not meet expectations or contractual specifications try to establish a reasonable pay schedule with the contractor such as paying  percent of the total cost for each  percent of the work that is completed its a good idea to include this payment plan in the contract as wellfinally look into getting a lien release signed before work begins if there is ever a dispute regarding payment over the course of the project a contractor or subcontractor could place a payment claim or lien on your property this can trigger a long legal process that may be frustrating to avoid this ask the contractor to sign a lien release which is a legal agreement that states that any payment accepted is final this can come in handy if a contractor has his or her own payment issues with their subcontractors signing a lien release form certifies that any payment made by a client to the contractor is enough to pay for any goods or services rendered a lien dispute could also be prevented by performing due diligence prior to picking a contractor as any contractor with good credit and a long track record of satisfied clients should have no trouble paying for materials and labor once all contract conditions have been metonce work is underway its never a bad idea to check up on the progress of the job either by staying in touch with the contractor over the phone or visiting the site in person if you work with a trustworthy professional its probably best to keep your distance and allow everyone to stay busy if you want to keep an eye on things make sure workers wear the right safety gear and that everything looks to be moving along according to schedule finally once work is finished and you are satisfied be sure to thank your contractor and tell friends or family members about your experience we just redesigned ypcom do you like

rosenberg and tcell immunotherapy for cancer apr   in cancer  immunology  next gen sequencing by dale yuzuki steven rosenberg nci at a  aacr plenary session as a person who worked at a melanoma research institute once upon a time the john wayne cancer institute in santa monica california by the way it was a pleasure to hear steven rosenberg’s plenary talk at the aacr meeting in san diego a lot has happened since  it was in the mid’s that i was working in the laboratory of dr david hoon and the institute was one of the few groups at that time that had several groups working on tumor immunology one of our main ‘competitors’ in the tumor immunology field for metastatic melanoma was steven rosenberg of the national cancer institute which had the history of being the longest nci research program project grantees at that time jwci had the secondlongest one dr rosenberg is the chief of surgery at the nci and has been working on cell transfer immunotherapy for many years his work is built on the insight from his work going back to the mid’s on the function of il to expand an individual’s specific tcell population for cellmediated lysis of cancer cells this approach has the potential for curing metastatic solid cancers such as colon prostate breast and others that resulted in over  deaths in the us in  successful cancer drugs herceptin cost patients b and avastin b in  prolong life of metastatic cancer patients when combined with chemotherapy without a doubt yet the effectiveness of these treatment is measured in months not in terms of being cured at this meeting i’ve seen way too many kaplanmeier curves something physicians are very familiar with tcell immunotherapy has the potential for using the exquisite specificity of the body’s own immune system to eliminate cancer tumor infiltrating lymphocytes til are taken from an individual’s metastatic lesion activated with il and expanded exvivo it is this process that is currently manual and laborintensive and after analysis and some additional processing reintroduced back into that same patient when il is administered to patients directly there was a relatively low rate of cancer regression – on the order of  for melanoma using tcell immunotherapy that number rises to  he reported on  individuals with  of them ‘complete responders’ with an average followup time of  years he showed a photograph of one complete responder who needed a second tcell immunotherapy treatment and the individual’s melanoma on the area beneath his ear was hard to look at it was about the size of a grapefruit but this individual is after  years showing no sign of recurrence with the ‘after’ photograph a remarkable contrast to the first and intermediate ones he then went on to the mechanism of melanoma immunogenicity using wholeexome sequencing of these individuals’ tumor for their snv’s that may code for specific peptide antigens processed by our immune systems and presented by the mhc complex from the exome sequence they look for nonsynonymous variants that change amino acid sequence in comparison with their germline exome sequence then computationally determine the mer or mer peptides that could be the specific individual’s antigens that the til’s are recognizing by cloning and expressing these longer proteins with the individual snvs expressed as concatenated peptides these are then processed by the patient’s til’s and then assayed for the ability to kill their own tumor cells invitro think about that – taking an individual’s tumor and tumor infiltrating leukocytes and that individual’s tumor exome sequence for all the coding genes in their cancer genome and determining the exact mer peptide that that individual’s own tcells are using against the cancer that threatens life in this specific example the gene identified was erbbip which dr rosenberg coined the term “the ultimate ‘personalized therapy” i feel compelled to note here that nextgeneration sequencing is for research use only and not for diagnostic procedures he then went on to show data that of the population of til’s from a primary tumor from an individual the majority of the cells  were the specific tcells against that specific tumor antigen we have come such a far way in tumor immunotherapy it was satisfying from professional scientific as well as personal levels for more

professor of surgery at the uniformed services university of health sciences and the george washington university school of medicine and health sciences he received his ba and md degrees at johns hopkins university and a phd in biophysics at harvard university after completing his residency training in surgery in  at the peter bent brigham hospital in boston massachusetts dr rosenberg became the chief of surgery at the nci nih a position he has held to the present time dr rosenberg developed the first effective immunotherapies and gene therapies for patients with advanced cancer his studies of cell transfer immunotherapy have resulted in durable complete remissions in patients with metastatic melanoma he was the first to successfully insert foreign genes into humans and his recent studies of the adoptive transfer of genetically modified lymphocytes has resulted in the regression of metastatic cancer in patients with melanoma sarcomas and lymphomas team name position amy

studies of cancer immunology to the conduct of clinical immunotherapy trials for patients with metastatic cancer the surgery branch was responsible for the development of interleukin il the first effective immunotherapy in humans the development of cell transfer immunotherapies for melanoma and other solid cancers the first insertion of foreign genes into humans and the first development of effective human cancer immunotherapies based on the genetic engineering of autologous lymphocytes with genes encoding antitumor t cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors examples of current laboratory research involve the identification of the optimal properties of lymphocytes capable of mediating antitumor effects in experimental models and in the human and the development of immunotherapies based on the identification of unique exomic mutations expressed by cancers that can be targeted by cell transfer therapy extensive programs are in place for the genetic modification of lymphocytes to target cancertestes antigens the surgery branch offers postdoctoral fellowships in cancer immunology and immunotherapy clinical fellowships are available to surgical residents who
