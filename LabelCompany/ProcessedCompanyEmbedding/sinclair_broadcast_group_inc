wbff channel  in baltimore maryland which signed on the air on april  of that year a subsidiary of chesapeake television corporation the commercial radio institute later founded wptt channel  now wpnt in pittsburgh in  and wtte channel  in columbus ohio in  all three stations originally were independents though wbff and wtte became charter affiliates of the fox broadcasting company at its launch in  sinclair broadcast groupedit earlier historyedit sinclair broadcast group logo – smiths son david d smith began taking a more active role in the company in the s in  the chesapeake television corporation changed its name to the sinclair broadcast group in  david smith and his three brothers bought their parents remaining stock and went on a buying spree that eventually made it one of the largest station owners in the country through the purchases of groups such as act iii broadcasting in  and river city broadcasting in  sinclair pioneered the concept of the local marketing agreement lma in american television in  when it sold wptt to its general manager eddie edwards founder of glencairn ltd the sinclairaffiliated licensee that would eventually become cunningham broadcasting in order to purchase fellow pittsburgh station wpghtv to comply with fcc ownership rules of the time that prohibited duopolies while agreeing to allow sinclair to retain operational responsibilities for the station however while lmas would become an integral part of the companys business model in subsequent years sinclairs plans to acquire kokhtv in oklahoma city through glencairn which would subsequently attempt to sell five of its  existing lmaoperated stations to sinclair outright in turn with sinclair stock included in the deal was challenged by the rainbowpush coalition headed by jesse jackson to the federal communications commission fcc in  citing concerns over a single company controlling two broadcast licenses in the same market in violation of fcc rules the coalition argued that glencairn passed itself off as a minorityowned company edwards is african american which since the smith family controlled most of the companys stock was technically a sinclair arm that planned to use the lma with kokh to gain control of the station and create an illegal duopoly with kocb in  the fcc levied a  fine against sinclair for illegally controlling glencairn sinclair became a publicly listed company in  while the smith family retained a controlling interest in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on july   sinclair stated that if the company could not refinance its  billion debt or if cunningham broadcasting became insolvent due to nonpayment on a loan worth  million sinclair may be forced to file for chapter  bankruptcy however the companys seemingly recovered its financial fortunes enough as it would begin a major string of acquisitions involving television stations and other properties two years later edit on may   it was announced that sinclair had purchased the professional wrestling promotion ring of honor roh as part of the purchase sinclair would produce a weekly hourlong program for roh to air on the groups stations with the intent to eventually syndicate the show to nonsinclair stations across the country it also announced that the company was in talks to purchase columbus ohio cw affiliate wwho from lin tv sinclair already owns abc affiliate wsyx and manages fox affiliate wttewhen however manhan media purchased that station in december  though it immediately turned around in february  and entered a shared services agreement with sinclair effectively giving them all but license control of wwho and resulting in the company controlling three stations in the columbus market similar to the arrangement it has with wztv wnab and wuxp in nashvillecitation needed on september   sinclair entered into an agreement to purchase all of the assets of four points media group from cerberus capital management for

officer edit on march   sinclair bought tennis media company for  million which includes the tenniscom website and tennis magazine the deal also includes up to  million in earnout if certain targets are reached sinclair intends to integrate the properties with tennis channel on april   following the reinstatement of the uhf discount a policy that counts television stations broadcasting on uhf channels by  of their total audience towards the fccs  market cap sinclair announced its intent to purchase bonten media group for  million the sale was approved on june  acquisition of tribune mediaedit on march   reports surfaced that sinclair broadcast group was in discussions to acquire chicagobased tribune media which was approached by sinclair management about a possible merger in late february any deal would occur pending fcc review of the uhf discount which had been eliminated in a  vote led by former fcc chairman tom wheeler in september  on grounds of the s rule obsolescence as uhf stations transmitting over the atsc digital format have improved signal reception compared to those which broadcast over the ntsc analog standard such a deal would compliment sinclair as it only has an  market overlap with tribune and requires minimum divestment additionally sinclair would expand its reach within the top markets – adding stations in markets such as new york city wpix which would displace wjlatv as its largest station by market size los angeles ktla chicago wgntv philadelphia wphltv and dallas kdaf – as well as gain a station in cleveland which would give the company at least one television station in every ohio market except youngstown in addition such a deal would also give sinclair a national cable presence in wgn america and further expand sinclairs multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of antenna tv chicagobased regional news channel chicagoland television and partial interests in food network and this tv reports later stated that sinclair was offering to buy tribune at a pershare price in the high s the reports of sinclairs interest in acquiring tribune led several unnamed station owners – which also inquired about purchasing some or all of tribunes assets outright or through a consortium – as well as tribune shareholder starboard value to approach st century fox about taking options to thwart the deal as a defensive measure the major impetus was that a combination of sinclair which is already the largest fox affiliate operator by station count with  primary and subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as cnn sinclair vp of news scott livingston stated that the company wanted to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers as part of an effort towards tracking the truth and telling the truth and allowing trump to clearly state his position on the key issues he also stated that sinclair had made similar offers to the hillary clinton campaign clinton did not do interviews with sinclair according to livingston though her running mate tim kaine did a spokesperson for the trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as hearst television a december   washington post review of sinclairs internal documents as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the companys stations revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of trumps campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of  the coverage included distribution of reports favorable to trumps campaign or challenging to clintons on a must run basis ie sinclair management required its stations to make room for the stories on their newscasts as well as sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of national importance to use in interviews with candidates a common company practice according to livingston so that other sinclair stations can share the content in may  in response to sinclairs announced intent to acquire tribune media craig aaron presidentceo of media advocacy group free press accused sinclair of currying favor with the trump administration through the interview arrangement

media company for  million which includes the tenniscom website and tennis magazine the deal also includes up to  million in earnout if certain targets are reached sinclair intends to integrate the properties with tennis channel on april   following the reinstatement of the uhf discount a policy that counts television stations broadcasting on uhf channels by  of their total audience towards the fccs  market cap sinclair announced its intent to purchase bonten media group for  million the sale was approved on june  acquisition of tribune mediaedit on march   reports surfaced that sinclair broadcast group was in discussions to acquire chicagobased tribune media which was approached by sinclair management about a possible merger in late february any deal would occur pending fcc review of the uhf discount which had been eliminated in a  vote led by former fcc chairman tom wheeler in september  on grounds of the s rule obsolescence as uhf stations transmitting over the atsc digital format have improved signal reception compared to those which broadcast over the ntsc analog standard such a deal would compliment sinclair as it only has an  market overlap with tribune and requires minimum divestment additionally sinclair would expand its reach within the top markets – adding stations in markets such as new york city wpix which would displace wjlatv as its largest station by market size los angeles ktla chicago wgntv philadelphia wphltv and dallas kdaf – as well as gain a station in cleveland which would give the company at least one television station in every ohio market except youngstown in addition such a deal would also give sinclair a national cable presence in wgn america and further expand sinclairs multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of antenna tv chicagobased regional news channel chicagoland television and partial interests in food network and this tv reports later stated that sinclair was offering to buy tribune at a pershare price in the high s the reports of sinclairs interest in acquiring tribune led several unnamed station owners – which also inquired about purchasing some or all of tribunes assets outright or through a consortium – as well as tribune shareholder starboard value to approach st century fox about taking options to thwart the deal as a defensive measure the major impetus was that a combination of sinclair which is already the largest fox affiliate operator by station count with  primary and subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as cnn sinclair vp of news scott livingston stated that the company wanted to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers as part of an effort towards tracking the truth and telling the truth and allowing trump to clearly state his position on the key issues he also stated that sinclair had made similar offers to the hillary clinton campaign clinton did not do interviews with sinclair according to livingston though her running mate tim kaine did a spokesperson for the trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as hearst television a december   washington post review of sinclairs internal documents as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the companys stations revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of trumps campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of  the coverage included distribution of reports favorable to trumps campaign or challenging to clintons on a must run basis ie sinclair management required its stations to make room for the stories on their newscasts as well as sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of national importance to use in interviews with candidates a common company practice according to livingston so that other sinclair stations can share the content in may  in response to sinclairs announced intent to acquire tribune media craig

media company for  million which includes the tenniscom website and tennis magazine the deal also includes up to  million in earnout if certain targets are reached sinclair intends to integrate the properties with tennis channel on april   following the reinstatement of the uhf discount a policy that counts television stations broadcasting on uhf channels by  of their total audience towards the fccs  market cap sinclair announced its intent to purchase bonten media group for  million the sale was approved on june  acquisition of tribune mediaedit on march   reports surfaced that sinclair broadcast group was in discussions to acquire chicagobased tribune media which was approached by sinclair management about a possible merger in late february any deal would occur pending fcc review of the uhf discount which had been eliminated in a  vote led by former fcc chairman tom wheeler in september  on grounds of the s rule obsolescence as uhf stations transmitting over the atsc digital format have improved signal reception compared to those which broadcast over the ntsc analog standard such a deal would compliment sinclair as it only has an  market overlap with tribune and requires minimum divestment additionally sinclair would expand its reach within the top markets – adding stations in markets such as new york city wpix which would displace wjlatv as its largest station by market size los angeles ktla chicago wgntv philadelphia wphltv and dallas kdaf – as well as gain a station in cleveland which would give the company at least one television station in every ohio market except youngstown in addition such a deal would also give sinclair a national cable presence in wgn america and further expand sinclairs multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of antenna tv chicagobased regional news channel chicagoland television and partial interests in food network and this tv reports later stated that sinclair was offering to buy tribune at a pershare price in the high s the reports of sinclairs interest in acquiring tribune led several unnamed station owners – which also inquired about purchasing some or all of tribunes assets outright or through a consortium – as well as tribune shareholder starboard value to approach st century fox about taking options to thwart the deal as a defensive measure the major impetus was that a combination of sinclair which is already the largest fox affiliate operator by station count with  primary and subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as cnn sinclair vp of news scott livingston stated that the company wanted to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers as part of an effort towards tracking the truth and telling the truth and allowing trump to clearly state his position on the key issues he also stated that sinclair had made similar offers to the hillary clinton campaign clinton did not do interviews with sinclair according to livingston though her running mate tim kaine did a spokesperson for the trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as hearst television a december   washington post review of sinclairs internal documents as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the companys stations revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of trumps campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of  the coverage included distribution of reports favorable to trumps campaign or challenging to clintons on a must run basis ie sinclair management required its stations to make room for the stories on their newscasts as well as sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of national importance to use in interviews with candidates a common company practice according to livingston so that other sinclair stations can share the content in may  in response to sinclairs announced intent to acquire tribune media craig

communications streamlined its operations which included selling off portions of the cable systems service franchises that it considered to be geographically nonstrategic charters huntingtoncharleston west virginia franchise was purchased by suddenlink communications sinclair requested a  million onetime fee and a per subscription per month fee from suddenlink for retransmission rights of both abc

of its  existing lmaoperated stations to sinclair outright in turn with sinclair stock included in the deal was challenged by the rainbowpush coalition headed by jesse jackson to the federal communications commission fcc in  citing concerns over a single company controlling two broadcast licenses in the same market in violation of fcc rules the coalition argued that glencairn passed itself off as a minorityowned company edwards is african american which since the smith family controlled most of the companys stock was technically a sinclair arm that planned to use the lma with kokh to gain control of the station and create an illegal duopoly with kocb in  the fcc levied a  fine against sinclair for illegally controlling glencairn sinclair became a publicly listed company in

media company for  million which includes the tenniscom website and tennis magazine the deal also includes up to  million in earnout if certain targets are reached sinclair intends to integrate the properties with tennis channel on april   following the reinstatement of the uhf discount a policy that counts television stations broadcasting on uhf channels by  of their total audience towards the fccs  market cap sinclair announced its intent to purchase bonten media group for  million the sale was approved on june  acquisition of tribune mediaedit on march   reports surfaced that sinclair broadcast group was in discussions to acquire chicagobased tribune media which was approached by sinclair management about a possible merger in late february any deal would occur pending fcc review of the uhf discount which had been eliminated in a  vote led by former fcc chairman tom wheeler in september  on grounds of the s rule obsolescence as uhf stations transmitting over the atsc digital format have improved signal reception compared to those which broadcast over the ntsc analog standard such a deal would compliment sinclair as it only has an  market overlap with tribune and requires minimum divestment additionally sinclair would expand its reach within the top markets – adding stations in markets such as new york city wpix which would displace wjlatv as its largest station by market size los angeles ktla chicago wgntv philadelphia wphltv and dallas kdaf – as well as gain a station in cleveland which would give the company at least one television station in every ohio market except youngstown in addition such a deal would also give sinclair a national cable presence in wgn america and further expand sinclairs multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of antenna tv chicagobased regional news channel chicagoland television and partial interests in food network and this tv reports later stated that sinclair was offering to buy tribune at a pershare price in the high s the reports of sinclairs interest in acquiring tribune led several unnamed station owners – which also inquired about purchasing some or all of tribunes assets outright or through a consortium – as well as tribune shareholder starboard value to approach st century fox about taking options to thwart the deal as a defensive measure the major impetus was that a combination of sinclair which is already the largest fox affiliate operator by station count with  primary and subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as cnn sinclair vp of news scott livingston stated that the company wanted to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers as part of an effort towards tracking the truth and telling the truth and allowing trump to clearly state his position on the key issues he also stated that sinclair had made similar offers to the hillary clinton campaign clinton did not do interviews with sinclair according to livingston though her running mate tim kaine did a spokesperson for the trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as hearst television a december   washington post review of sinclairs internal documents as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the companys stations revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of trumps campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of  the coverage included distribution of reports favorable to trumps campaign or challenging to clintons on a must run basis ie sinclair management required its stations to make room for the stories on their newscasts as well as sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of national importance to use in interviews with candidates a common company practice according to livingston so that other sinclair stations can share the content in may  in response to sinclairs announced intent to acquire tribune media craig

west virginia franchise was purchased by suddenlink communications sinclair requested a  million onetime fee and a per subscription per month fee from suddenlink for retransmission rights of both abc affiliate wchstv and fox affiliate wvahtv on the suddenlink cable system this led to a protracted media battle and smear campaign between the two companies and sinclair pulled the two stations off of charters systems in the neighboring beckley west virginia marketcitation needed after several weeks of negotiations the two companies reached an agreement which allowed wchstv and wvahtv to continue transmission over the suddenlink cable system the terms of the agreement were not released to the public mediacomedit mediacom filed an antitrust lawsuit against sinclair on october  claiming that the group insisted on blanket carriage of  sinclairownedmanaged stations across mediacomoperated service areas where sinclair operates a television station regardless of market differences the district

sides remained at an impasse over how much money mediacom should pay sinclair for carriage of its stations on january  the federal communications commissions media bureau denied mediacoms complaint stating that sinclair failed to negotiate with mediacom in good faith after failing to respond to mediacoms offer to take the dispute to binding arbitration before the deadline sinclair pulled all  stations from mediacoms lineups shortly after midnight on january  despite a plea from iowas congressional delegation urging the two sides to submit to binding arbitration sinclair rejected the plea on january  the two sides discussed the dispute in front of iowa lawmakers on january  on january   senators daniel inouye chairman of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation and ranking member ted stevens signed a letter addressed to fcc chairman kevin martin the impasse ended on february  when mediacom announced that it had reached a retransmission agreement with sinclair

during the first quarter of  in december  sinclair announced that it would pull all of its stations from mediacom systems for the second time in three years if a new carriage agreement was not reached by midnight on december  the impasse had threatened coverage of the january  orange bowl in iowa where the hawkeyes played and the january   bcs national championship game in alabama mediacom and lawmakers from iowa and alabama asked the fcc to intervene on december  mediacom and sinclair agreed to an eightday extension of the retransmission agreement that permitted sinclairs stations to remain on mediacom until january  both sides reached a oneyear retransmission agreement on january  one day before the interim agreement was set to expire time warner cableedit sinclair was also involved with retransmission negotiations with time warner cable at the same time as the mediacom dispute in  and  however in this case the two sides reached an agreement on january   in november

 regardless of the outcome time warner cable was obligated to carry fox network programming on its systems due to a deal reached with the network earlier in  however the agreement did not extend to syndicated and locally produced programs on sinclairs fox affiliates the two companies reached an agreement on january   shortly after the deadline was extended by another  hours comcastedit in a january   article broadcasting  cable reported that sinclair might pull  stations from comcast systems after its retransmission agreement was slated to expire on february  comcast was granted an extension to march  and again to march  comcast stated that it would not pay cash for retransmission rights but was willing to barter for example promoting sinclair stations on cable channels carried by comcast devoid of any advertising payments by the company on march  comcast and sinclair jointly announced a fouryear deal for retransmission rights expiring on march   sinclair and comcast came to a new agreement for continued carriage on march   this agreement was negotiated without any public statements or announcements dish networkedit dish networks retransmission agreement with sinclair broadcast group was slated to expire on august   if an agreement had not reached by that time  sinclair stations would have been blacked out including the affiliates of three of the major networks a representative for dish network stated that sinclair is seeking a massive price increase that would force dish to pay more to carry sinclair’s stations than it pays to any other broadcaster a sinclair

dispute dish and sinclair came to an agreement on august  averting the removal of its any of the groups stations on august   ten days after the  retransmission agreement had expired dish customers

agreement had not been reached by that date  sinclair stations were to be blacked out by the satellite provider representatives for sinclair noted that they have been negotiating for quite some time in an effort to reach a new agreement at this time it does not appear that these efforts will be successful although sinclair does not believe that it is constructive to negotiate its private business relationships in public sinclair is informing the public in advance of the end of carriage because it is aware of the impact on a segment of the public from the end of the relationship between the sinclair stations and directv directv stated we will compensate sinclair fairly but our customers should not be forced to pay more than twice as much for the same programs that remain available

lmas would become an integral part of the companys business model in subsequent years sinclairs plans to acquire kokhtv in oklahoma city through glencairn which would subsequently attempt to sell five of its  existing lmaoperated stations to sinclair outright in turn with sinclair stock included in the deal was challenged by the rainbowpush coalition headed by jesse jackson to the federal communications commission fcc in  citing concerns over a single company controlling two broadcast licenses in the same market in violation of fcc rules the coalition argued that glencairn passed itself off as a minorityowned company edwards is african american which since the smith family controlled most of the companys stock was technically a sinclair arm that planned to use the lma with kokh to gain control of the station and create an illegal duopoly with kocb in  the fcc levied a  fine against sinclair for illegally controlling glencairn sinclair became a publicly listed company in

from cunningham broadcasting fcc duopoly regulations normally disallow two of the four highestrated stations which are usually the affiliate stations of the big four networks from being directly owned by a single entity however in this case due to the presence of usbased spanishlanguage stations in the market among the top four sinclair cited that kdbc was ranked fourth overall in the el paso market while kfox was the sixthrated station permitting a direct purchase of the former the entire titan deal closed on october  on june   the company announced its purchase of dielectric

media company for  million which includes the tenniscom website and tennis magazine the deal also includes up to  million in earnout if certain targets are reached sinclair intends to integrate the properties with tennis channel on april   following the reinstatement of the uhf discount a policy that counts television stations broadcasting on uhf channels by  of their total audience towards the fccs  market cap sinclair announced its intent to purchase bonten media group for  million the sale was approved on june  acquisition of tribune mediaedit on march   reports surfaced that sinclair broadcast group was in discussions to acquire chicagobased tribune media which was approached by sinclair management about a possible merger in late february any deal would occur pending fcc review of the uhf discount which had been eliminated in a  vote led by former fcc chairman tom wheeler in september  on grounds of the s rule obsolescence as uhf stations transmitting over the atsc digital format have improved signal reception compared to those which broadcast over the ntsc analog standard such a deal would compliment sinclair as it only has an  market overlap with tribune and requires minimum divestment additionally sinclair would expand its reach within the top markets – adding stations in markets such as new york city wpix which would displace wjlatv as its largest station by market size los angeles ktla chicago wgntv philadelphia wphltv and dallas kdaf – as well as gain a station in cleveland which would give the company at least one television station in every ohio market except youngstown in addition such a deal would also give sinclair a national cable presence in wgn america and further expand sinclairs multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of antenna tv chicagobased regional news channel chicagoland television and partial interests in food network and this tv reports later stated that sinclair was offering to buy tribune at a pershare price in the high s the reports of sinclairs interest in acquiring tribune led several unnamed station owners – which also inquired about purchasing some or all of tribunes assets outright or through a consortium – as well as tribune shareholder starboard value to approach st century fox about taking options to thwart the deal as a defensive measure the major impetus was that a combination of sinclair which is already the largest fox affiliate operator by station count with  primary and subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks

on january  the two sides discussed the dispute in front of iowa lawmakers on january  on january   senators daniel inouye chairman of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation and

lawmakers from iowa and alabama asked the fcc to intervene on december  mediacom and sinclair agreed to an eightday extension of the retransmission agreement that permitted sinclairs stations to remain on mediacom until january  both sides reached a oneyear retransmission agreement on january  one day before the interim agreement was set to expire time warner cableedit sinclair was also

a new agreement for continued carriage on march   this agreement was negotiated without any public statements or announcements dish networkedit dish networks retransmission agreement with sinclair broadcast group was slated to expire on august   if an agreement had not reached by that time  sinclair stations would have been blacked out including the affiliates of three of the major networks a

agreement had not been reached by that date  sinclair stations were to be blacked out by the satellite provider representatives for sinclair noted that they have been negotiating for quite some time in an effort to reach a new agreement at this time it does not appear that these efforts will be successful although sinclair does not believe that it is constructive to negotiate its private business relationships in public sinclair is informing the public in advance of the end of carriage because it is aware of the impact on a segment of the public from the end of the relationship between the sinclair stations and directv directv stated we will compensate sinclair fairly but our customers should not be forced to pay more than twice as much for the same programs that remain available

the commercial radio institute later founded wptt channel  now wpnt in pittsburgh in  and wtte channel  in columbus ohio in  all three stations originally were independents though wbff and wtte became charter affiliates of the fox broadcasting company at its launch in  sinclair broadcast groupedit earlier historyedit sinclair broadcast group logo – smiths son david d smith began taking a more active role in the company in the s in  the chesapeake television corporation changed its name to the sinclair broadcast group in  david smith and his three brothers bought their parents remaining stock and went on a buying spree that eventually made it one of the largest station owners in the country through the purchases of groups such as act iii broadcasting in  and river city broadcasting in  sinclair pioneered the concept of the local marketing agreement lma in american television in  when it sold wptt to its general manager eddie edwards founder of glencairn ltd the sinclairaffiliated licensee that would eventually become cunningham broadcasting in order to purchase fellow pittsburgh station wpghtv to comply with fcc ownership rules of the time that prohibited duopolies while agreeing to allow sinclair to retain operational responsibilities for the station however while lmas would become an integral part of the companys business model in subsequent years sinclairs plans to acquire kokhtv in oklahoma city through glencairn which would subsequently attempt to sell five of its  existing lmaoperated stations to sinclair outright in turn with sinclair stock included in the deal was challenged by the rainbowpush coalition headed by jesse jackson to the federal communications commission fcc in  citing concerns over a single company controlling two broadcast licenses in the same market in violation of fcc rules the coalition argued that glencairn passed itself off as a minorityowned company edwards is african american which since the smith family controlled most of the companys stock was technically a sinclair arm that planned to use the lma with kokh to gain control of the station and create an illegal duopoly with kocb in  the fcc levied a  fine against sinclair for illegally controlling glencairn sinclair became a publicly listed company in  while the smith family retained a controlling interest in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on july   sinclair stated that if the company could not refinance its  billion debt or if cunningham broadcasting became insolvent due to nonpayment on a loan worth  million sinclair may be forced to file for chapter  bankruptcy however the companys seemingly recovered its financial fortunes enough as it would begin a major string of acquisitions involving television stations and other properties two years later edit on may   it was announced that sinclair had purchased the professional wrestling promotion ring of honor roh as part of the purchase sinclair would produce a weekly hourlong program for roh to air on the groups stations with the intent to eventually syndicate the show to nonsinclair stations across the country it also announced that the company was in talks to purchase columbus ohio cw affiliate wwho from lin tv sinclair already owns abc affiliate wsyx and manages fox affiliate wttewhen however manhan media purchased that station in december  though it immediately turned around in february  and entered a shared services agreement with sinclair effectively giving them all but license control of wwho and resulting in the company controlling three stations in the columbus market similar to the arrangement it has with wztv wnab and wuxp in nashvillecitation needed on september   sinclair entered into an agreement to purchase all of the assets of four points media group from cerberus capital management for  million the federal trade commission ftc gave its antitrust approval of the deal in late september as a result that october

– to terminate the outsourcing agreement which was set to expire in march  five months early sinclair would also supply working capital to the stations in consideration of service fees and performance incentives through the lmas the group deal was officially completed on january   after the fcc approved it on december   on november   it was announced that sinclair would purchase all eight television stations owned by freedom communications in a move for freedom to eliminate its debt sinclair took over the operations of the freedom stations on december   through time brokerage agreements the deal was granted approval by the fcc on march   and was consummated on april  edit on may   sinclair renewed its affiliation agreement for its  fox affiliates for five years through  the agreement included the option for sinclair to purchase baltimore mynetworktv affiliate wutb from fox television stations at any point between july   and march   if exercised this would create a

the deal also includes up to  million in earnout if certain targets are reached sinclair intends to integrate the properties with tennis channel on april   following the reinstatement of the uhf discount a policy that counts television stations broadcasting on uhf channels by  of their total audience towards the fccs  market cap sinclair announced its intent to purchase bonten media group for  million the sale was approved on june  acquisition of tribune mediaedit on march   reports surfaced that sinclair broadcast group was in discussions to acquire chicagobased tribune media which was approached by sinclair management about a possible merger in late february any deal would occur pending fcc review of the uhf discount which had been eliminated in a  vote led by former fcc chairman tom wheeler in september  on grounds of the s rule obsolescence as uhf stations transmitting over the atsc digital format have improved signal reception compared to those which broadcast over the ntsc analog standard such a deal would compliment sinclair as it only has an  market overlap with tribune and requires minimum divestment additionally sinclair would expand its reach within the top markets – adding stations in markets such as new york city wpix which would displace wjlatv as its largest station by market size los angeles ktla chicago wgntv philadelphia wphltv and dallas kdaf – as well as gain a station in cleveland which would give the company at least one television station in every ohio market except youngstown in addition such a deal would also give sinclair a national cable presence in wgn america and further expand sinclairs multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of antenna tv chicagobased regional news channel chicagoland television and partial interests in food network and this tv reports later stated that sinclair was offering to buy tribune at a pershare price in the high s the reports of sinclairs interest in acquiring tribune led several unnamed station owners – which also inquired about purchasing some or all of tribunes assets outright or through a consortium – as well as tribune shareholder starboard value to approach st century fox about taking options to thwart the deal as a defensive measure the major impetus was that a combination of sinclair which is already the largest fox affiliate operator by station count with  primary and subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as cnn sinclair vp of news scott livingston stated that the company wanted to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers as part of an effort towards tracking the truth and telling the truth and allowing trump to clearly state his position on the key issues he also stated that sinclair had made similar offers to the hillary clinton campaign clinton did not do interviews with sinclair according to livingston though her running mate tim kaine did a spokesperson for the trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as hearst television a december   washington post review of sinclairs internal documents as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the companys stations revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of trumps campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of  the coverage included distribution of reports favorable to trumps campaign or challenging to clintons on a must run basis ie sinclair management required its stations to make room for the stories on their newscasts as well as sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of national importance to use in interviews with candidates a common company practice according to livingston so that other sinclair stations can share the content in may  in response to sinclairs announced intent to acquire tribune media craig aaron presidentceo of media advocacy group free press accused sinclair of currying favor with the trump administration through the interview arrangement

duopolies while agreeing to allow sinclair to retain operational responsibilities for the station however while lmas would become an integral part of the companys business model in subsequent years sinclairs plans to acquire kokhtv in oklahoma city through glencairn which would subsequently attempt to sell five of its  existing lmaoperated stations to sinclair outright in turn with sinclair stock included in the deal was challenged by the rainbowpush coalition headed by jesse jackson to the federal communications commission fcc in  citing concerns over a single company controlling two broadcast licenses in the same market in violation of fcc rules the coalition argued that glencairn passed itself off as a minorityowned company edwards is african american which since the smith family controlled most of the companys stock was technically a sinclair arm that planned to use the lma with kokh to gain control of the station and create an illegal duopoly with kocb in  the fcc levied a  fine against sinclair for illegally controlling glencairn sinclair became a publicly listed company in  while the smith family retained a controlling interest in a filing with the securities

highestrated stations which are usually the affiliate stations of the big four networks from being directly owned by a single entity however in this case due to the presence of usbased spanishlanguage

– adding stations in markets such as new york city wpix which would displace wjlatv as its largest station by market size los angeles ktla chicago wgntv philadelphia wphltv and dallas kdaf – as well as gain a station in cleveland which would give the company at least one television station in every ohio market except youngstown in addition such a deal would also give sinclair a national cable presence in wgn america and further expand sinclairs multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of antenna tv chicagobased regional news channel chicagoland television and partial interests in food network and this tv reports later stated that sinclair was offering to buy tribune at a pershare price in the high s the reports of sinclairs interest in acquiring tribune led several unnamed station owners – which also inquired about purchasing some or all of tribunes assets outright or through a consortium – as well as tribune shareholder starboard value to approach st century fox about taking options to thwart the deal as a defensive measure the major impetus was that a combination of sinclair which is already the largest fox affiliate operator by station count with  primary and subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as cnn sinclair vp of news scott livingston stated that the company wanted to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers as part of an effort towards tracking the truth and telling the truth and allowing trump to clearly state his position on the key issues he also stated that sinclair had made similar offers to the hillary clinton campaign clinton did not do interviews with sinclair according to livingston though her running mate tim kaine did a spokesperson for the trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as hearst television a december   washington post review of sinclairs internal documents as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the companys stations revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of trumps campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of  the coverage included distribution of reports favorable to trumps campaign or challenging to clintons on a must run basis ie sinclair management required its stations to make room for the stories on their newscasts as well as sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of national importance to use in interviews with candidates a common company practice according to livingston so that other sinclair stations can share the content in may  in response to sinclairs announced intent to acquire tribune media craig aaron presidentceo of media advocacy group free press accused sinclair of currying favor with the trump administration through the interview arrangement with trump the groups february hiring of former trump campaign aide boris epshteyn as a political analyst and executive chair david smiths meetings with thenfcc commissioner ajit pai prior to pais

suddenlinkedit in the summer of  charter communications streamlined its operations which included selling off portions of the cable systems service franchises that it considered to be geographically nonstrategic charters huntingtoncharleston west virginia franchise was purchased by suddenlink communications sinclair requested a  million onetime fee and a per subscription per month fee from suddenlink for retransmission rights of both abc affiliate wchstv and fox affiliate wvahtv on the suddenlink cable system this led to a protracted media battle and smear campaign between the two companies and sinclair pulled the two stations off of charters systems in the neighboring beckley west virginia marketcitation needed after several weeks of negotiations the two companies reached an agreement which allowed wchstv and wvahtv to continue transmission over the suddenlink cable system the terms of the agreement were not released to the public mediacomedit mediacom filed an antitrust lawsuit against sinclair on october  claiming that the group insisted on blanket carriage of  sinclairownedmanaged stations across mediacomoperated service areas where sinclair operates a television

court of appeals for the eighth circuit but dropped the request on december  sinclairs retransmission agreement with mediacom was originally set to expire on december   but the group later extended the deadline to january   despite the extension the two sides remained at an impasse over how much money mediacom should pay sinclair for carriage of its stations on january  the federal communications commissions media bureau denied mediacoms complaint stating that sinclair failed to negotiate with mediacom in good faith after failing to respond to mediacoms offer to take the dispute to binding arbitration before the deadline sinclair pulled all  stations from mediacoms lineups shortly after midnight on january  despite a plea from iowas congressional delegation urging the two sides to submit to binding arbitration sinclair rejected the plea on january  the two sides discussed the dispute in front of iowa lawmakers on january  on january   senators daniel inouye chairman of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation and ranking member ted stevens signed a letter addressed to fcc chairman kevin martin the impasse ended on february  when mediacom announced that it had reached a retransmission agreement with sinclair for undisclosed terms all  stations were restored to mediacom systems shortly after the agreement was announced mediacom lost  subscribers during the last quarter of  and an additional  subscribers during the first quarter of  in december  sinclair announced that it would pull all of its stations from mediacom systems for the second time in three years if a new carriage agreement was not reached by midnight on december  the impasse had threatened coverage of the january  orange bowl in iowa where the hawkeyes played and the january   bcs national championship game in alabama mediacom and lawmakers from iowa and alabama asked the fcc to intervene on december  mediacom and sinclair agreed to an eightday extension of the retransmission agreement that permitted sinclairs stations to remain on mediacom until january  both sides reached a oneyear retransmission agreement on january  one day before the interim agreement was set to expire time warner cableedit sinclair was also involved with retransmission negotiations with time warner cable at the same time as the mediacom dispute in  and  however in this case the two sides reached an agreement on january   in november  sinclair announced that it would pull  of its stations in  cities from time warner cable on january   if the two parties did not come to an agreement the deadline was subsequently extended to january   regardless of the outcome time warner cable was obligated to carry fox network programming on its systems due to a deal reached with the network earlier in  however the agreement did not extend to syndicated and locally produced programs on sinclairs fox affiliates the two companies reached an agreement on january   shortly after the deadline was extended by another  hours comcastedit in a january   article broadcasting  cable reported that sinclair might pull  stations from comcast systems after its retransmission agreement was slated to expire on february  comcast was granted an extension to march  and again to march  comcast stated that it would not pay cash for retransmission rights but was willing to barter for example promoting sinclair stations on cable channels carried by comcast devoid of any advertising payments by the company on march  comcast and sinclair jointly announced a fouryear deal for retransmission rights expiring on march   sinclair and comcast came to a new agreement for continued carriage on march   this agreement was negotiated without any public statements or announcements dish networkedit dish networks retransmission agreement with sinclair broadcast group was slated to expire on august   if an agreement had not reached by that time  sinclair stations would have been blacked out including the affiliates of three of the major networks a representative for dish network stated that sinclair is seeking a massive price increase that would force dish to pay more to carry sinclair’s stations than it pays to any other broadcaster a sinclair representative meanwhile stated that it believes significant doubt exists as to whether or not a new agreement will be reached with dish dish network subsequently set up its own website regarding the dispute dish and sinclair came to an agreement on august  averting the removal of its any of the groups stations on august   ten days after

with sinclair was slated to expire on february   if an agreement had not been reached by that date  sinclair stations were to be blacked out by the satellite provider representatives for sinclair noted that they have been negotiating for quite some time in an effort to reach a new agreement at this time it does not appear that these efforts will be successful although sinclair does not believe that it is constructive to negotiate its private business relationships in public sinclair is informing the public in advance of the end of carriage because it is aware of the impact on a segment of the public from the end of the relationship between the sinclair stations and directv directv stated we will compensate sinclair fairly but our customers should not be forced to pay more than twice as

subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as cnn sinclair vp of news scott livingston stated that the company wanted to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers as part of an effort towards tracking the truth and telling the truth and allowing trump to clearly state his position on the key issues he also stated that sinclair had made similar offers to the hillary clinton campaign clinton did not do interviews with sinclair according to livingston though her running mate tim kaine did a spokesperson for the trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as hearst television a december   washington post review of sinclairs internal documents as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the companys stations revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of trumps campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of  the coverage included distribution of reports favorable to trumps campaign or challenging to clintons on a must run basis ie sinclair management required its stations to make room for the stories on their newscasts as well as sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of national importance to use in interviews with candidates a common company practice according to livingston so that other sinclair stations can share the content in may  in response to sinclairs announced intent to acquire tribune media craig aaron presidentceo of media advocacy group free press accused sinclair of currying favor with the trump administration through the interview arrangement with trump the groups february hiring of former trump campaign aide boris epshteyn as a political analyst and executive chair david smiths meetings with thenfcc commissioner ajit pai prior to pais

suddenlinkedit in the summer of  charter communications streamlined its operations which included selling off portions of the cable systems service franchises that it considered to be geographically nonstrategic charters huntingtoncharleston west virginia franchise was purchased by suddenlink communications sinclair requested a  million onetime fee and a per subscription per month fee from suddenlink for retransmission rights of both abc affiliate wchstv and fox affiliate wvahtv on the suddenlink cable system this led to a protracted media battle and smear campaign between the two companies and sinclair pulled the two stations off of charters systems in the neighboring beckley west virginia marketcitation needed after several weeks of negotiations the two companies reached an agreement which allowed wchstv and wvahtv to continue transmission over the suddenlink cable system the terms of the agreement were not released to the public mediacomedit mediacom filed an antitrust lawsuit against sinclair on october  claiming that the group insisted on blanket carriage of  sinclairownedmanaged stations across mediacomoperated service areas where sinclair operates a television

court of appeals for the eighth circuit but dropped the request on december  sinclairs retransmission agreement with mediacom was originally set to expire on december   but the group later extended the deadline to january   despite the extension the two sides remained at an impasse over how much money mediacom should pay sinclair for carriage of its stations on january  the federal communications commissions media bureau denied mediacoms complaint stating that sinclair failed to negotiate with mediacom in good faith after failing to respond to mediacoms offer to take the dispute to binding arbitration before the deadline sinclair pulled all  stations from mediacoms lineups shortly after midnight on january  despite a plea from iowas congressional delegation urging the two sides to submit to binding arbitration sinclair rejected the plea on january  the two sides discussed the dispute in front of iowa lawmakers on january  on january   senators daniel inouye chairman of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation and ranking member ted stevens signed a letter addressed to fcc chairman kevin martin the impasse ended on february  when mediacom announced that it had reached a retransmission agreement with sinclair for undisclosed terms all  stations were restored to mediacom systems shortly after the agreement was announced mediacom lost  subscribers during the last quarter of  and an additional  subscribers during the first quarter of  in december  sinclair announced that it would pull all of its stations from mediacom systems for the second time in three years if a new carriage agreement was not reached by midnight on december  the impasse had threatened coverage of the january  orange bowl in iowa where the hawkeyes played and the january   bcs national championship game in alabama mediacom and lawmakers from iowa and alabama asked the fcc to intervene on december  mediacom and sinclair agreed to an eightday extension of the retransmission agreement that permitted sinclairs stations to remain on mediacom until january  both sides reached a oneyear retransmission agreement on january  one day before the interim agreement was set to expire time warner cableedit sinclair was also involved with retransmission negotiations with time warner cable at the same time as the mediacom dispute in  and  however in this case the two sides reached an agreement on january   in november  sinclair announced that it would pull  of its stations in  cities from time warner cable on january   if the two parties did not come to an agreement the deadline was subsequently extended to january   regardless of the outcome time warner cable was obligated to carry fox network programming on its systems due to a deal reached with the network earlier in  however the agreement did not extend to syndicated and locally produced programs on sinclairs fox affiliates the two companies reached an agreement on january   shortly after the deadline was extended by another  hours comcastedit in a january   article broadcasting  cable reported that sinclair might pull  stations from comcast systems after its retransmission agreement was slated to expire on february  comcast was granted an extension to march  and again to march  comcast stated that it would not pay cash for retransmission rights but was willing to barter for example promoting sinclair stations on cable channels carried by comcast devoid of any advertising payments by the company on march  comcast and sinclair jointly announced a fouryear deal for retransmission rights expiring on march   sinclair and comcast came to a new agreement for continued carriage on march   this agreement was negotiated without any public statements or announcements dish networkedit dish networks retransmission agreement with sinclair broadcast group was slated to expire on august   if an agreement had not reached by that time  sinclair stations would have been blacked out including the affiliates of three of the major networks a representative for dish network stated that sinclair is seeking a massive price increase that would force dish to pay more to carry sinclair’s stations than it pays to any other broadcaster a sinclair representative meanwhile stated that it believes significant doubt exists as to whether or not a new agreement will be reached with dish dish network subsequently set up its own website regarding the dispute dish and sinclair came to an agreement on august  averting the removal of its any of the groups stations on august   ten days after

with sinclair was slated to expire on february   if an agreement had not been reached by that date  sinclair stations were to be blacked out by the satellite provider representatives for sinclair noted that they have been negotiating for quite some time in an effort to reach a new agreement at this time it does not appear that these efforts will be successful although sinclair does not believe that it is constructive to negotiate its private business relationships in public sinclair is informing the public in advance of the end of carriage because it is aware of the impact on a segment of the public from the end of the relationship between the sinclair stations and directv directv stated we will compensate sinclair fairly but our customers should not be forced to pay more than twice as

in  when it sold wptt to its general manager eddie edwards founder of glencairn ltd the sinclairaffiliated licensee that would eventually become cunningham broadcasting in order to purchase fellow pittsburgh station wpghtv to comply with fcc ownership rules of the time that prohibited duopolies while agreeing to allow sinclair to retain operational responsibilities for the station however while lmas would become an integral part of the companys business model in subsequent years sinclairs plans to acquire kokhtv in oklahoma city through glencairn which would subsequently attempt to sell five of its  existing lmaoperated stations to sinclair outright in turn with sinclair stock included in the deal was challenged by the rainbowpush coalition headed by jesse jackson to the federal communications commission fcc in  citing concerns over a single company controlling two broadcast licenses in the same market in violation of fcc rules the coalition argued that glencairn passed itself off as a minorityowned company edwards is african american which since the smith family controlled most of the companys stock was technically a sinclair arm that planned to use the lma with kokh to gain control of the station and create an illegal duopoly with kocb in  the fcc levied a  fine against sinclair for illegally controlling glencairn sinclair became a publicly listed company in

fccs  market cap sinclair announced its intent to purchase bonten media group for  million the sale was approved on june  acquisition of tribune mediaedit on march   reports surfaced that sinclair broadcast group was in discussions to acquire chicagobased tribune media which was approached by sinclair management about a possible merger in late february any deal would occur pending fcc review of the uhf discount which had been eliminated in a  vote led by former fcc chairman tom wheeler in september  on grounds of the s rule obsolescence as uhf stations transmitting over the atsc digital format have improved signal reception compared to those which broadcast over the ntsc analog standard such a deal would compliment sinclair as it only has an  market overlap with tribune and requires minimum divestment additionally sinclair would expand its reach within the top markets – adding stations in markets such as new york city wpix which would displace wjlatv as its largest station by market size los angeles ktla chicago wgntv philadelphia wphltv and dallas kdaf – as well as gain a station in cleveland which would give the company at least one television station in every ohio market except youngstown in addition such a deal would also give sinclair a national cable presence in wgn america and further expand sinclairs multicasting and cable portfolio with the additions of antenna tv chicagobased regional news channel chicagoland television and partial interests in food network and this tv reports later stated that sinclair was offering to buy tribune at a pershare price in the high s the reports of sinclairs interest in acquiring tribune led several unnamed station owners – which also inquired about purchasing some or all of tribunes assets outright or through a consortium – as well as tribune shareholder starboard value to approach st century fox about taking options to thwart the deal as a defensive measure the major impetus was that a combination of sinclair which is already the largest fox affiliate operator by station count with  primary and subchannelonly affiliates and tribune the networks largest affiliate operator by total market reach as its  fox stations are concentrated in top markets would potentially result in sinclair obtaining leverage over st century fox in reverse compensation negotiations for its fox and mynetworktv affiliates the  fox affiliates that the two companies own cover a combined  of the us although st century fox ceo james murdoch told investors in february that it was unlikely that its fox television stations unit would acquire additional stations if the fcc relaxed ownership regulations financial times reported on april  that fox was considering a partnership with private equity firm the blackstone group – in which blackstone would help finance the acquisition while fox would contribute its existing ownedandoperated stations to the joint venture – to bid for tribune fox eventually dropped its bid for the company shortly before final bids were submitted to tribune board members and shareholders on may  after it and blackstone were unable to agree on an offer structure in such a short time period on may   reports indicated that sinclair was nearing a deal to purchase tribune these reports were confirmed on may  when sinclair announced that it would acquire tribune for  billion along with the assumption of tribunes  billion debt load it beat nexstar media group which was not willing to make a higher bid closer to tribunes appraisal price for the stations the deal is expected to receive fcc approval sometime in the fourth quarter of  to comply with department of justice antitrust and fcc ownership regulations assuming a draft of the latter agencys media ownership review – which is expected to be released as early as late summer – is unable to receive congressional approval sinclair will likely be required to sell stations owned by either company in up to twelve markets in order to address ownership conflicts the most significant conflicts exist in seattle salt lake city oklahoma city harrisburg and grand rapids–kalamazoo where sinclair and tribune each have two stations that rank among the four highestrated in terms of total viewership and maintain news departments other divestitures or signal reshuffling may be required in st louis portland oregon norfolkvirginia beach greensborowinstonsalemhigh point richmond scrantonwilkesbarre and des moines where ownership regulations would be violated either because sinclair already has or would have operational stewardship of three or more stations or just two stations with too few independent station owners to permit a duopoly if the national station ownership cap is not raised any further sinclair will also have to divest certain stations in nonconflict markets that would put its total reach over the current  limit the enlarged group would effectively cover nearly  of the us but would still reach over  coverage even with the uhf discount factored in sinclair ceo christopher ripley stated that the company would consider full divestitures of any conflict stations to independent buyers stating the markets where station divestitures were likeliest to occur to comply with antitrust regulations on advertising share are in seattle scrantonwilkesbarre and salt lake city however fcc chairman ajit pais relaxed scrutiny on outsourcing agreements raised concerns by opponents of the deal – most notably by house minority leader nancy pelosi and house committee on energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone in a letter they coauthored in advance of the fccs april  vote that reinstated the uhf discount – that sinclair could choose to retain the conflict stations through its partner companies potentially eliminating an independent news voice in those markets among the other objections to the deal expressed by free press and other media advocacy groups was the perceived conservative lean of the groups syndicated news content as observers expressed concern that the expansion of partisan content by sinclair into new markets could worsen existing distrust of american media organizations to local media which has maintained higher ratings of trustworthiness among the general public over national media the concerns about sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside nexstar media group which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the merger by preventing the uhf discount from being reinstated on june   the district of columbia court of appeals issued a sevenday administrative stay to the uhf discount rulemaking in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by the institute for public representation a coalition of public interest groups comprising free press the united church of christ media mobilizing project the prometheus radio project the national hispanic media coalition and common cause on may  the coalition argued that the uhf discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint as stations that transmit on the uhf band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on vhf a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership the dc court of appeals denied the emergency stay motion on june   though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the uhf discount implementation programmingedit sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called news central that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the groups stations these segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts mark e hyman a highranking executive at sinclair also created the point a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments david smith has had direct influence on the programming of sinclair stations due to his own personal standpoints salon magazine reported that after having been arrested during a sting for soliciting prostitution in  baltimore md he mandated his newsroom staff produce and report a series on a local drug counseling program to partially fulfill the requirements of a plea deal salon also recounted that wbff reporter from  to  luanne canipe really hated the way david handled the newsroom political viewsedit sinclairs stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions the washington post noted that wjlatvs news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following sinclairs acquisition of the station while the company also produces pieces from a washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint in april  sinclair announced it had hired boris epshteyn who was briefly the white house assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the trump administration and a senior advisor of donald trumps presidential campaign as chief political analyst growth of the company has benefited from rule changes at the fcc under the trump administration  sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports segments and editorials referred to as mustruns the practice has been criticized by the news staff of some of sinclairs stations due to the viewpoints that they propagate following the september  attacks sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of president george w bushs response to the attack the baltimore sun reported that the staff of sinclairs baltimore station wbff internally objected to the editorial as they felt that the endorsement would undermine public faith in their political objectivity the station however complied with the mandate newsroom employees of komo in seattle told the new york times that they felt the national pieces were low quality and were too politically skewed for the citys progressive audience one employee admitted that they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesserviewed portions of newscasts such as around commercial breaks in  sinclairs political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of sinclairs recent campaign contributions were to the republican party in particular the center for public integrity showed concern that the republican slant of sinclairs news programming along with mark hymans past history of government lobbying such as for the fcc to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership made its stations provide anything but fair and balanced news programming hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were pretty balanced and that the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike sinclair stations have been involved in various controversies surrounding politicallymotivated programming decisions such as news coverage and specials during the leadups to elections that were in support of the republican party nightline reading of the namesedit in april  sinclairs abc affiliates refused to air an episode of nightline that featured a reading of the names of soldiers killed in the  invasion and subsequent occupation of iraq in response sinclair argued that the broadcast appeared to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the united states in iraq abc responded saying that the program was meant to be an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country sinclair also argued that the nightline broadcast undermined a thenongoing effort by its washington bureau to report on positive untold stories from iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets stolen honor documentaryedit later in october  just two weeks prior to the  presidential election it was reported that all  of sinclairs stations would preempt prime time programming to air stolen honor wounds that never heal a documentary critical of us presidential candidate john kerrys antivietnam war activism the film was produced by carlton sherwood a former associate of tom ridge and accused kerry of prolonging the vietnam war because of his antiwar activism the organization swift boat veterans for truth an antikerry organization in the  election year was crosspromoting the film as part of a  million advertising campaign in response the democratic national committee filed a legal motion with the federal election commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air partisan propaganda in the last  days of an election campaign as this controversy made the news with a number of sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and sinclair stock dropping  in eleven days sinclair announced that it had never intended to air stolen honor in an hour slot in the first place indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format ultimately sinclair did not broadcast any such show following the incident sinclair fired its washington bureau chief jon lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in the baltimore sun as biased political propaganda breaking point infomercialedit in november  it was reported that five fox affiliates and one abc affiliate owned by sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of thenpresident barack obama breaking point  minutes that will change america which was sponsored by the national republican trust political action group the infomercial painted obama as an extremist and claimed that during the  presidential campaign he received some campaign money from the hamas terrorist group and that obama said in a speech you want freedom you’re gonna have to kill some crackers you gonna have to kill some of those babies the special also discusses obama advisers van jones and john holdren as well as obama staff anita dunn kevin jennings carol browner and cass sunstein – all in an unflattering light in one case the special claimed that holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court the infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of october  on sinclairowned stations in madison cape girardeau lexington pittsburgh des moines and winstonsalem – all in swing states vital to the  elections  preelection specialedit on november   six sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day such as the libyan civil war and health care reform the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station while scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station columbus ohio abc affiliate wsyx preempted both abc world news and nightline to air it the special was met with controversy for showing a bias against obama and focusing little on republican candidate mitt romney as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally a sinclair staff member disputed these claims stating that no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their news value and resonation with the public coverage during the  presidential election campaignedit on december   jared kushner soninlaw of thenpresidentelect donald trump stated that it had reached deals with sinclair to give the company extended access to the trump campaign in exchange for airing without further commentary interviews with the republican party candidate on its stations which kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as cnn sinclair vp of news scott livingston stated that the company wanted to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers as part of an effort towards tracking the truth and telling the truth and allowing trump to clearly state his position on the key issues he also stated that sinclair had made similar offers to the hillary clinton campaign clinton did not do interviews with sinclair according to livingston though her running mate tim kaine did a spokesperson for the trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as hearst television a december   washington post review of sinclairs internal documents as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the companys stations revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of trumps campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of  the coverage included distribution of reports favorable to trumps campaign or challenging to clintons on a must run basis ie sinclair management required its stations to make room for the stories on their newscasts as well as sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of national importance to use in interviews with candidates a common company practice according to livingston so that other sinclair stations can share the content in may  in response to sinclairs announced intent to acquire tribune media craig aaron presidentceo of media advocacy group free press accused sinclair of currying favor with the trump administration through the interview arrangement with trump the groups february hiring of former trump campaign aide boris epshteyn as a political analyst and executive chair david smiths meetings with thenfcc commissioner ajit pai prior to pais appointment as the agencys chair in exchange for

communications streamlined its operations which included selling off portions of the cable systems service franchises that it considered to be geographically nonstrategic charters huntingtoncharleston west virginia franchise was purchased by suddenlink communications sinclair requested a  million onetime fee and a per subscription per month fee from suddenlink for retransmission rights of both abc affiliate wchstv and fox affiliate wvahtv on the suddenlink cable system this led to a protracted media battle and smear campaign between the two companies and sinclair pulled the two stations off of

sides remained at an impasse over how much money mediacom should pay sinclair for carriage of its stations on january  the federal communications commissions media bureau denied mediacoms complaint stating that sinclair failed to negotiate with mediacom in good faith after failing to respond to mediacoms offer to take the dispute to binding arbitration before the deadline sinclair pulled all  stations from mediacoms lineups shortly after midnight on january  despite a plea from iowas congressional delegation urging the two sides to submit to binding arbitration sinclair rejected the plea on january  the two sides discussed the dispute in front of iowa lawmakers on january  on january   senators daniel inouye chairman of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation and ranking member ted stevens signed a letter addressed to fcc chairman kevin martin the impasse ended on february  when mediacom announced that it had reached a retransmission agreement with sinclair

by midnight on december  the impasse had threatened coverage of the january  orange bowl in iowa where the hawkeyes played and the january   bcs national championship game in alabama mediacom and lawmakers from iowa and alabama asked the fcc to intervene on december  mediacom and sinclair agreed to an eightday extension of the retransmission agreement that permitted sinclairs stations to remain on mediacom until january  both sides reached a oneyear retransmission agreement on january  one day before the interim agreement was set to expire time warner cableedit sinclair was also involved with retransmission negotiations with time warner cable at the same time as the mediacom dispute in  and  however in this case the two sides reached an agreement on january   in november

a new agreement for continued carriage on march   this agreement was negotiated without any public statements or announcements dish networkedit dish networks retransmission agreement with sinclair broadcast group was slated to expire on august   if an agreement had not reached by that time  sinclair stations would have been blacked out including the affiliates of three of the major networks a representative for dish network stated that sinclair is seeking a massive price increase that would force dish to pay more to carry sinclair’s stations than it pays to any other broadcaster a sinclair representative meanwhile stated that it believes significant doubt exists as to whether or not a new agreement will be reached with dish dish network subsequently set up its own website regarding the dispute dish and sinclair came to an agreement on august  averting the removal of its any of the groups stations on august   ten days after the  retransmission agreement had expired dish customers

in an effort to reach a new agreement at this time it does not appear that these efforts will be successful although sinclair does not believe that it is constructive to negotiate its private business relationships in public sinclair is informing the public in advance of the end of carriage because it is aware of the impact on a segment of the public from the end of the relationship between the

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
