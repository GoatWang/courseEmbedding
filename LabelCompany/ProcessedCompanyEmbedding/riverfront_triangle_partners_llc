broadwaythose discussions and studies have involved entities like the missoula downtown association and providence health and services the parent organization of st patrick hospital which owns much of

0  pm edt updated tuesday august  0  pm edt a south bendbased development group wants to build a luxury condominium development along the st joseph river in the city wharf partners llc says the more than  million project is expected to be complete next year july  0 news release south bend ind  wharf partners llc announces that a new urban lifestyle option  riverfront midrise luxury condominiums–is coming to south bend known as the cascade condominiums the location is at the former wharf restaurant property on colfax avenue at the river situated between the river and the east race waterway the prime site overlooks century center the downtown skyline and the rushing waters of the cascades swirling below the st joseph river dam the site is also opposite the keepers of the fire inriver kinetic sculpture created by worldrenowned artist mark disuvero the cascade will offer its residents a gracious and sophisticated urban living experience on what is simply the single most dynamic property anywhere in the community two story residential towers will provide residents with panoramic views both upanddown river across the entire downtown skyline and along the east race some sightlines extend all the way to notre dame planned for occupancy in 0 the cascade is owned and being developed by wharf partners llc which acquired the parcel in late 0 after the previous owner invested more a decade attempting to develop the site for various uses we believe that this is the right time and that we have the right product for this magnificent site states frank perri one of the partners a new lowrise housing market has taken hold on the east bank in recent years which we applaud but what were developing now is essentially a downtown chicago or indianapolis caliber midrise project appropriately scaled to the south bend market the cascade will bring a longdeserved level of development density and elegance to this key riverfront site creating a new housing option that is unavailable anywhere else in the marketplace perched above an ongrade enclosed parking level that elevates the condominiums for privacy and views each floor contains only two units which vary in size from approximately 00 to  sq ft and which may be combined into a single 00 sq ft condominium thats larger than most executive homes in granger perri notes in addition to the enclosed parking all condominiums will have cardaccess entry and elevator service floor to ceiling window walls with panoramic views and private balconies facing the river between the towers will be a fullyenclosed landscaped groundlevel courtyard and all occupants will share access to a common th level green roof terrace and entertainment penthouse with a wet bar and restroom decorative rooftop lighting and outdoors eating areas second floor units will offer private green roof patios and an optional solarium extension as well the buildings design incorporates green concepts and sustainable design principles managed by leedaccredited professionals of panzica building corporation including the influence of panzica architects west coast design studio in redmond washington while several model plans have been developed each condominium will be custom planned by registered interior designers to suit the tastes and lifestyle of each individual owner according to architect philip panzica the buildings will be constructed of durable and attractive precast concrete making the structure far stronger safer and more durable than wood framing common to lowrise multihousing the buildings will also be fully firesprinkled and alarmed panzica notes that his firm has received two national awards for design excellence in precast concrete and in addition to featuring large expanses of glass the facades will be textured and stained to have the appearance of brick and cut stone the cascades design strikes a deliberate balance between the sleek modernism of the notable structures across the river including philip johnsons century center and helmet jahns st source centerdoubletree contrasted with the burly th century industrial aesthetic of historic stephenson mills next door the cascade will also transition the scale of downtown central business district to the east side of the river helping to visually connect the east bank village with the heart of the city panzica observes the further importance of having a significant development on the riverfront site to strengthen a link between downtown and revitalized areas around the notre dame campus such as the notre dame avenue corridor st josephs high school eddy street commons and the new triangle neighborhood most thoroughfares tying notre dame to downtown pass through the east bank village says panzica so this site and the riverfront are vital to the new tapestry that’s being woven between notre dame and south bends urban core the phase i south tower adjacent to seitz park will include up to twelve condominiums for which prereservations are being accepted for anticipated 0 occupancy a phase ii companion tower along colfax will follow pending the pace of presales a mixeduse structure along colfax may be developed
