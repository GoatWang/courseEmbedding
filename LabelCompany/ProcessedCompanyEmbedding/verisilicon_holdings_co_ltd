cik  we estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional adss from us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us these estimates are based upon an assumed initial offering price of  per ads the midpoint of the initial public offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus each  change in the assumed initial public offering price of  per ads would in the case of an increase increase and in the case of a decrease decrease the net proceeds we receive from this offering by approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional adss from us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us similarly each one million ads increase decrease in the number of adss offered by us would increase decrease the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately  million assuming the assumed initial public offering price of  per ads remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us the amount of estimated net proceeds discussed above is illustrative only and the actual net proceeds will be determined in part by the actual public offering price and number of adss sold by us and the other terms of this offering the principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to create a public market for our adss and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets we plan to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes if shadow preference shares are issued in connection with this offering we will use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to redeem shadow preference shares whether or not we are required to issue shadow preference shares and the number of shadow preference shares that we may be required to issue and therefore redeem will depend on the midpoint of the price range per ads set forth on the cover page of the last preliminary prospectus the number of shadow preference shares we may be required to issue will also depend on the number of adss we are offering as set forth on the cover page of the last preliminary prospectus and the number of our fully diluted ordinary shares on the day prior to the date of that last preliminary prospectus and information in this paragraph is based on the number of our fully diluted ordinary shares as of december   and assumes that there will be no change in the number of adss we are offering from that set forth on the cover page of this prospectus subject to the foregoing and assuming that the midpoint of the price range per ads appearing on the cover page of the last preliminary prospectus is equal to the midpoint of the initial public offering price range per ads appearing on the cover of this prospectus and further assuming that all outstanding warrants to purchase our series c preference shares series d preference shares and series e preference shares are exercised for cash we would be required to issue a total of approximately shadow preference shares and to redeem those shadow preference shares upon completion of this offering for an aggregate cash redemption price of approximately  million however if this prospectus is not the last preliminary prospectus and if the midpoint of the price range or the number of adss we are offering as set forth on the cover page of the last preliminary prospectus differs from the midpoint of the initial public offering price range per ads or number of adss set forth on the cover page of this prospectus then the number of shadow preference shares we may be required to issue and the aggregate redemption price of those shadow preference shares will differ from the amounts set forth in the immediately preceding sentence likewise we calculated the foregoing number of shadow preference shares and their aggregate redemption price based on the number of our fully diluted ordinary shares as of december   and there have been changes in the number of our fully diluted ordinary shares since that date that will affect this calculation we may also use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for acquisitions of complementary businesses technologies or other assets we have not entered into any agreements or commitments with respect to any specific acquisitions and have no understandings or agreements with respect to any such acquisition at this time pending application of the net proceeds from this offering for the foregoing purposes we may invest such net proceeds in bank accounts or other short term investments except for any net proceeds we may be required to use to redeem shadow preference shares we cannot specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received by us from this offering accordingly our management team will have broad discretion in using the net proceeds to be received by us from this offering chinese law may limit or prevent us from investing net proceeds in or loaning net proceeds to our prc subsidiaries and our ability to use net proceeds from this offering in china is subject to significant uncertainty the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including demand for our customers’ products design starts and our customers’ budgetary constraints technology in the markets for which we provide solutions evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature size decreases substantially increasing the complexity cost and risk of semiconductor design and manufacturing at the same time our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor in order to succeed in this environment we must successfully meet our customers’ technology requirements and increase the value of our services while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs many of the products in which our ip is incorporated are in the consumer electronics sector such as mobile devices which is a highly competitive sector aggressive competition in the consumer electronics markets could result in substantial declines in the license fees and royalty rates that we are able to charge our customers for our ip as well as the number of turnkey and nre projects that we generate in the past some of our competitors have sought to increase their share of certain markets by reducing their license fees and royalty rates or the fees that they charge for their design or engineering services and may do so in the future we face competition from a large number of companies including the following primary competitors  in our turnkey and nre design services businesses we compete primarily against global unichip corp faraday technology corporation esilicon corporation and opensilicon inc and  in our license and royalty business we compete against a large number of companies who design and license their own technologies including ceva inc cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc in the design of dsp solutions and imagination technologies group plc and chipsmedia inc in the design of video processing solutions we also compete with internal engineering teams at semiconductor companies when these companies design ip or complete designs inhouse we lose an opportunity to generate revenue in licensing and royalties our nre design services or turnkey products categories we expect that as the markets for our solutions grow new entrants will enter these markets and existing competitors may make significant investments to compete more effectively against us as each of these markets in which we compete become developed markets leading semiconductor companies focusing on developed markets may increasingly enter our target markets our ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside of our control including  the functionality and performance of our solutions and those of our competitors  our relationship with our customers and other industry participants  prices of our nre design services turnkey products and ip licenses and prices of our competitors’ solutions  our ability to provide our nre design services in a timely fashion  our reputation and ability to provide satisfactory customer support  our research and development capabilities to provide innovative solutions  our ability to retain highlevel talent including our management team and engineers and  our ability to protect our ip we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors however many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial sales and marketing manufacturing distribution technical and other resources than us as a result they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer demands or to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sales of their solutions than we can our competitors may develop and introduce new solutions that have lower prices provide superior performance provide greater processing power or achieve greater market acceptance than our solutions it is possible that new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share which could materially and adversely affect our business revenue and operating results if we fail to compete successfully our business would suffer and we may lose or be unable to gain market share company
