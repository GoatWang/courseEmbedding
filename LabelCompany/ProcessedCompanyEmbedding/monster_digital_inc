inc and its whollyowned subsidiary sdj technologies inc overview general our primary business focus is the design development and marketing of premium products under the monster digital brand for use in highperformance computing and consumer and mobile product applications we have invested significantly in building a broad distribution channel for the sale of products bearing the monster digital brand our current focus is to leverage our distribution network through cooperating with monster inc to identify and market additional specialty and consumer electronics products currently our primary product offerings are as follows a line of action sports cameras used in adventure sport adventure photography and extremeaction videography a line of ultrasmall mobile external memory drive products for apple ios devices onthego cloud devices on an exclusive basis which create a wifi hot spot for multiple users while simultaneously allowing data to be viewed played or transferred among the connected storage a broad selection of highvalue memory storage products consisting of highend ruggedized solid state drives ssds removable flash memory compactflash cards cf cards secured digital cards sd cards and usb flash drives our license with monster inc allows us to manufacture and sell certain highend products utilizing the monster premium brand name which is highly recognized by consumers for its high quality audiovideo products we work with our worldclass subcontract manufacturers and suppliers to offer new and enhanced products that use existing technology and adopt new technologies to satisfy existing and emerging consumer demands and preferences on the marketing side we partner with monster inc to support the sales and marketing of these products on a global basis historically memory has been the most significant part of our business and it is a commodity that tends to be subject to price erosion using the monster branding to quickly introduce new technologies to the market is designed to bring about the introduction of products that are not subject to the same level of downward pressure on pricing as is common with memory products in addition we intend to expand and continue to invest in our international operations which we believe will be an important factor in our continued growth as a result of our strategy to increase our investments in sales marketing support and international expansion we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations at least in the near future and may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business net sales the principal factors that have affected or could affect our net sales from period to period are the condition of the economy in general and of the memory storage products industry in particular our customers adjustments in their order levels changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers the addition or termination of key supplier relationships the rate of introduction and acceptance by our customers of new products our ability to compete effectively with our current and future competitors our ability to enter into and renew key corporate and strategic relationships with our customers vendors and strategic alliances changes in foreign currency exchange rates a major disruption of our information technology infrastructure unforeseen catastrophic events such as armed conflict terrorism fires typhoons and earthquakes and any other disruptions such as labor shortages unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems cost of goods sold cost of goods sold primarily includes the cost of products that we purchase from third party manufacturers and sell to our customers additional packaging and assembly labor costs for certain product orders is also a component of costs of goods sold cost of goods sold is also affected by inventory obsolescence if our inventory management is not effective or efficient we mitigate the risk of inventory obsolescence by stocking relatively small amounts of inventory at any given time and relying instead on a strategy of manufacturing or acquiring products based on orders placed by our customers general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses relate primarily to compensation and associated expenses for personnel in general management information technology human resources procurement planning and finance as well as outside legal investor relations accounting consulting and other operating expenses selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses relate primarily to salary and other compensation and associated expenses for internal sales and customer relations personnel advertising outbound shipping and freight costs tradeshows royalties under a brand license and selling commissions research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development projects as well as materials and equipment used for these projects and third party compensation for research and development services we do not engage in any longterm research and development contracts and all research and development costs are expensed as incurred other expenses interest and finance expense includes interest paid or payable to a finance company for outstanding borrowings bank fees purchase order finance fees interest accrued on convertible debt amortization of a debt discount that arose as a result of the issuance of warrants with convertible debt and amortization of debt issuance costs debt conversion expense is a noncash charge for the effect of an induced conversion of debt to equity three months ended march   compared to three months ended march   results of operations the following discussion explains in greater detail our consolidated operating results and financial condition this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes herein three months ended march    net sales for the three months ended march   increased approximately  to  from  for the three months ended march   we are beginning to gain traction with our action sports camera line even as we significantly reduce sales of memory product in the three months ended march   sales in our action sports camera line represented  of our total sales in three months ended march   sales in our action sports camera line represented  of our total sales three months ended march    in thousands cost of goods sold     gross profit loss      gross profit margin     cost of goods increased approximately  which was greater than the increase in sales as a percent of net sales cost of goods sold was  in the three months ended march   as compared to  for the three months ended march   gross profit in the three months ended march   decreased to  from  in the three months ended march   gross profit three months ended march    in thousands selling and marketing     general and administrative     sales and marketing for the three months ended march   increased approximately  to  compared to  for the three months ended march   the increase in sales and marketing expense was significantly attributable to the increase in royalty expense as the monster inc royalty payment rate increased in the third quarter of  general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   increased by approximately  to  compared to  in the three months ended march   there was an approximate  increase in stockbased compensation in the three months ended march   as compared to the three months ended march   in addition there was an increase in legal expense since becoming a public company in july  three months ended march    rd for the three months ended march   increased approximately  to  compared to  for the three months ended march   the increase is most significantly related to having an employee who is working on new product procurement and design during the first quarter of  with respect to our products the basic functional technology we use has changed very little over time therefore our rd spending has primarily related to enhancing existing functionality introducing new functions within existing products and designing and engineering new products largely with existing proven technology though we are in the process of product redesign we do not expect that rd costs as a percentage of sales will be significant for the foreseeable future three months ended march    in thousands interest and finance expense     gain on settlement of customer refund    interest expense for the three months ended march   included  of interest expense related to bridge financing that was converted to equity as part of the initial public offering in july  also during that period we incurred interest expense related to accounts receivable factoring that is not being used during the three months ended march   gain on settlement of customer refund of  is the amortization of a  deferred gain that resulted from a settlement agreement on a customer refund from fiscal  three months ended march    in thousands income tax expense generally consists of state income taxes due or paid in the states in which we operate we have not recognized a deferred tax benefit for the operating losses generated during the periods due to the uncertainty that we will generate taxable income in the future that will allow us to utilize the benefit financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity throughout the three months ended march   and  have been our initial public offering cash raised in private placements of common stock and collections on accounts receivable in june  we secured an accounts receivable financing facility with bay view funding the contract provides for maximum funding of  million and a factoring fee of  for the first  days and  for each day period thereafter that the financed receivable remains outstanding as of march   there was no balance owed on this facility the facility automatically renews annually at yearend unless terminated with  days notice on july   we closed an initial public offering and received net proceeds of  in november  we issued  shares of common stock in a private placement receiving net proceeds of approximately  in march  the company issued additional shares pursuant to a private placement memorandum issuing  shares receiving net proceeds of approximately  discussion of cash flows three months ended march    change in thousands net cash used in operating activities          net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities     net decrease in cash          operating activities net cash used in operating activities in the three months ended march   was approximately  million due primarily to the net loss of  million the loss as a use of cash was partially offset by noncash stockbased compensation of  by using existing inventory for sales during the quarter and by a  increase in accounts payable one other significant use of cash was a  reduction in an amount due to a customer in the three months ended march   the use of cash for operating activities was primarily related to the net loss of  million partially offset by the collection of accounts receivable of  a decrease in inventory of  and a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  investing activities our current operating structure does not depend upon a significant investment in capital equipment or operating facilities substantially all of our manufacturing is conducted offshore by third party manufacturers our office and warehouse facilities are leased under a threeyear operating lease for the three months ended march   and  we used no cash in investing activities financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended march   was  and was attributable to issuance of common stock pursuant to a private placement memorandum net cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended march   was  and was attributable to bridge loan financing and preferred stock issuances during the first quarter of  debt instruments as of march   debt instruments include two convertible notes payable with a total principal amount of  due in  that remain unpaid operating and capital expenditure requirements we have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future we expect our cash expenditures to increase in the near term as we fund our future growth as a publicly traded company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a private company in addition the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission or sec and the nasdaq stock market requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that are currently inapplicable to us as a private company we expect these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly our current cash balance is not sufficient to fund the operations for the next twelve months as such the company believes that substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern exists we will need to raise substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations in order to meet these additional cash requirements we would likely need to sell additional equity or convertible securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible securities these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us if at all if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing agreements with third parties it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates technologies or future revenue streams or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirement please see risk factors in our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on march   offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable sec rules and regulations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates which are based upon historical experiences market trends and financial forecasts and projections and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at that certain point in time actual results may differ significantly at times from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others revenue recognition net sales revenue are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists when delivery has occurred when the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers which is generally when product is delivered to the customer and the customer has accepted delivery certain customers have limited rights of return andor are entitled to price adjustments on products held in their inventory we reduce net sales in the period of sale for estimates of product returns price adjustments and other allowances our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of sales customer inventories price adjustments average selling prices and market conditions price protection is calculated on a product by product basis the objective of price protection is to mitigate returns by providing retailers with credits to ensure maximum consumer sales price protection is granted to retailers after they have presented us an affidavit of existing inventory actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions resulting in an adjustment to net sales inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on the weighted average cost method of accounting we purchase finished goods and materials to assemble kits in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used in the near term changes in operating strategy customer demand and fluctuations in market values can limit our ability to effectively utilize all products purchased and can result in finished goods with abovemarket carrying costs which may cause losses on sales to customers our policy is to closely monitor inventory levels obsolescence and lower market values compared to costs and when necessary reduce the carrying amount of inventory to market value as of march   and december   inventory on hand was comprised primarily of finished goods ready for sale and packaging materials sharebased compensationwarrants valuation we use the blackscholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants on the date of grant the amount of compensation or other expense recognized using the blackscholes model requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our sharebased grants the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors including the grant price the expected future volatility the expected term of the option or warrant and the riskfree interest rate correlating to the term of the option or warrant the expected term is derived using the simplified method provided in securities and exchange commission release staff accounting bulletin no  which averages an awards weighted average vesting period and contractual term for plain vanilla share options the expected volatility is estimated by analyzing the historic volatility of similar public companies the riskfree rate of return reflects the weighted average interest rate offered for us treasury rates over the expected life of options or warrants the expected term and expected future volatility requires our judgment in addition we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize a cost or expense for those stock options or warrants expected to vest fair value measurements fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability fair value is based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques which is determined on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs create a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level  quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets level  quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets level  valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable all stock options are valued under methods of fair value under the level  tier as described above factors included in the valuation of common stock prior to the initial public offering underlying stock options and warrants include the present value of future cash flows capital structure valuation of comparable companies existing licensing agreements and the growth prospects for our product line these factors were incorporated into an income approach and a market approach in order to derive an overall valuation of our common stock of  such a valuation is dependent upon estimates that are highly complex and subjective recently issued accounting pronouncements see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements may   c
