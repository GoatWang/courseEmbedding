genome we can identify the genetic variants associated with these risks and can therefore guide you to dietary modifications to mitigate these risks as well as proper therapeutic interventions if necessary for example a variant hd ccg was detected in your hfe gene what does this mean variants in hfe are associated with a condition called hereditary hemochromatosis you carry one “nonworking”
