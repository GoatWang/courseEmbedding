strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives ill provide an update on our progress on these initiatives in just a moment first let me begin with a few financial and operational highlights of the first quarter as summarized on slide four this morning we announced first quarter  adjusted earnings per share of  results for our regulated utilities were modestly below our internal plan as a result of significant storm costs in the carolinas milder weather and weaker than expected customer volumes we continue to see strong customer growth and our month rolling average volumes continue to track consistently with our expectations operating results for our international business were in line with our expectations as hydrology began to return to more normal levels in brazil we also recognized tax adjustments at international during the quarter which steve will review in a movement as weve looked at the balance of the year we are affirming our full year  guidance range of  to  per share daily operational excellence continues to underpin our commitment to our customers communities and investors that commitment starts with our focus on safety for  duke energys employees safety record received the top rank among large utilities as recognize by eei our generation fleet also performed well during the quarter our nuclear fleet achieved a  capacity factor building on its record breaking performance in  in indiana our edwardsport igcc facility continues to improve its operational performance in february the gasifiers achieved  availability our best month ever our growing natural gas fleet is also benefiting customers and the environment taking advantage of low natural gas prices in march of this year our gasfired plant set a record for monthly natural gas consumption surpassing the record set last june this is indicative of the strategic coaltogas shift in our generation portfolio which has enabled us to reduce carbon emissions by  since  our organization responded well to weather challenges in the first quarter in january winter storm jonas struck the carolinas causing approximately  customer outages there were also ice and wind storms in february impacting more than  customers in the carolinas our teams performed admirably during these events continuing to provide customers with the level of service theyve come to expect next let me update you on our coal ash basin closure activities in the carolinas we continue to make outstanding progress with closure activities underway at six sites for each of our basins the north carolina department of environmental quality is required by statue to recommend risk classifications preliminary classifications were released at the end of january followed by a public comment period we expect deq to finalize their classifications shortly the risk classifications will impact basin closure methods timing and costs based on our comprehensive engineering analysis of our basins we believe the majority of the remaining unclassified basins meet the requirements for a low classification allowing  years and closure methods which include storing the ash in place w are committed to safe basin closure in a way that protects our communities and the environment while minimizing cost to customers we will keep you informed as the regulatory review process continues to advance turning to slide five ill highlight several recent milestones in our important growth initiatives our fiveyear capital plan through  includes a deployment of between  billion and  billion in growth capital in new natural gasfired generation grid investment commercial and regulated renewables and gas pipeline infrastructure these investments are directed at improving customer service modernizing our generation fleet and the electric grid as well as investing in natural gas infrastructure that is complementary to our system these investments support our transition toward businesses that provide stable longterm growth in earnings and the dividend during the quarter we received approval from the north carolina utilities commission for our  billion western carolinas modernization project in ashville this allows us to move forward with retiring the asheville coal plant by  and replacing it with two highly efficient natural gas combined cycle units in south carolina construction of our  million ws lee natural gas combined cycle plant is well underway the project is on budget and on target for a november  inservice date we also broke ground on our  billion natural gasfired citrus county combined cycle plant in florida staying on track for a  inservice date were building on our success and growing our commercial and regulated renewable assets in our commercial portfolio our two megawatt wind projects los vientos iv and frontier are on target to come online later this year since the beginning of the year weve announced the acquisition of nine new solar projects including eight in north carolina in our regulated utilities weve announced  megawatts of planned solar installations for  in the carolinas florida and indiana thats already about  of what we achieved in  which was a very strong year for solar investment in fact duke energy progress was ranked third among all utilities in  for bringing new solar capacity online additionally as pictured on this slide we recently completed an iconic solar farm to serve the power needs of walt disney world resort in orlando in the first quarter we also made good progress in our grid modernization efforts in march we announced a settlement agreement with nearly all interveners including key consumer groups on our sevenyear indiana td infrastructure investment program the  billion plan will provide much needed technology and infrastructure upgrades that will benefit customers providing improved reliability and safety fewer and shorter power outages better information and overall energy savings in addition the settlement allows us to continue evaluating the installation of smart meters in our indiana service territory which would be eligible for recovery in a future rate case the grid modernization hearings with the indiana utility regulatory commission began yesterday and we expect a decision around midyear our two commercial natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects atlantic coast pipeline and sabal trail continue moving forward sabal trail received ferc approval in february and the pipeline is on target to begin construction in the second quarter and be in operation in  atlantic coast pipeline is also progressing and has adopted several alternate routes increasing the lengths of the pipeline from about  miles to just under  miles the project partners recently submitted updated information related to these alternative routes as well as responses to all of fercs outstanding environmental information requests were confident that ferc will soon be able to issue its draft environmental impact statement the next important project milestone and in fact i believe that statement was issued this morning the project partners have devoted significant time and resources to ensure that the environmental issues have been fully addressed and as a result weve adjusted our expectation for receipt of the ferc certificate to mid we are still planning for a late  inservice date for the project turning to slide six i will address recent activities around the strategic transition of our overall business portfolio toward regulated and contracted electric and gas infrastructure businesses the two strategic transactions highlighted on this slide will complete the realignment of our portfolio to focus entirely on domestic businesses that drive more stable earnings and cash flows lets start with our pending acquisition of piedmont natural gas in march we received approval from the tennessee regulatory authority for a change in control upon acquisition by duke energy the final remaining approval is with the north carolina utilities commission which has scheduled hearing for july  we remain confident of closing the transaction before the end of this year additionally at the end of february we successfully priced a common stock offering to fund the equity portion of the piedmont acquisition the  million offering was well received by our investors as a reminder the shares were offered in a forward structure this means we will not issue the shares until the forward is settled at the time the piedmont transaction closes we are also progressing on the planned exit of our latin american generation business weve begun initial steps in marketing the assets including signing nondisclosure agreements and providing information to interested parties this business includes high quality assets which we believe will attract significant interest for potential buyers we will keep you updated on this important strategic transition in conclusion im pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our growth investments were also maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency our business portfolio transition positions duke as an industryleading domestic infrastructure business with stable transparent earnings and cash flows were looking forward to continuing our progress on this transition throughout  now let me turn it over to steve steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks lynn before i begin id like to take a moment to thank bill currens for his seven years as a leader with the investor relations team bills tireless commitment to delivering accurate transparent information to our analysts and investors has been outstanding i will look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as our senior vice president chief accounting officer  controller as many of you know mike callahan is succeeding bill as vice president of investor relations currently mike serves as director of regulated utilities forecasting he has also had extensive experience in treasury financial planning and analysis and investor relations were delighted hes returning to ir to lead the team where he will continue our efforts to serve our shareholders and investors today ill focus on four primary areas first ill discuss the major drivers of our first quarter results and provide an update to our fullyear adjusted eps guidance range for  ill discuss our retail volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories ill spend a few moments on the continued cost management efforts underway and then i will close with a review of our key investor considerations lets start with the quarterly results i will cover the highlights on slide seven for more detailed information on segment variances versus last year please refer to the supporting materials that accompany todays press release first quarter adjusted diluted earnings were  per share compared to  in the first quarter of  the lower results in the current year reflect milder winter weather in  and the absence of midwest generation results due to the successful sale of the business in april  additionally in  we incurred significant winter storm costs and somewhat softer retail volumes which were offset by a tax adjustment at international on a reported basis  first quarter earnings per share were  compared to  last year let me briefly review key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments on an adjusted basis regulated utilities results declined by  per share principally driven by the milder weather in the carolinas and midwest higher revenues from pricing and riders in the carolinas and ohio were mostly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service including the acquisition of the ncempa assets in july  additionally we incurred higher om expense during the quarter as a result of winter storm cost in the carolinas which were higher than our planning assumptions by  offsetting emergent storm expenses were lower outage costs and increased cost efficiencies throughout the organization as expected our commercial portfolio declined by  per share in the first quarter of  primarily due to the absence of the midwest generation business which was sold in april of  our commercial renewables benefited from improved levels of wind production this quarter and growth from new renewable projects other was down  per share primarily due to prior year tax adjustments and higher interest expense in the quarter moving to international operational performance in particular in brazil strengthened during the quarter hydrology in brazil has improved significantly during the recent rainy season reservoir levels in southeast brazil are approximately  compared to around  this time last year this improvement has resulted in increased hydro production throughout brazil and lower purchased power costs to meet our contractual commitments we also had  of favorable tax related items associated with the international segment during the quarter which represents the impact of several events you will recall in the fourth quarter of  we declared a  billion dividend at international in order to efficiently bring funds back to the us in early  we announced our intent to exit the international business this decision combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by congress in late  allows us to more efficiently utilize foreign tax credits and reduce our us income taxes as a result of our intent to exit the international business we will recognize additional us income taxes for international up until the point of sale overall and with our first quarter results we remain on track to achieve our  guidance range of between  to  per share moving onto slide eight ill now discuss our retail customer volume trends on a rolling month basis weathernormalized retail load growth was  through the first quarter for the first quarter our retail load growth trends were soft within the residential sector we continued to experience strong growth in the number of new customers approximately  over the recent  months however after moderating for most of  residential customer usage trends have declined during the quarter due to the slow economic recovery and adoption of energy efficiency initiatives employment and wage growth trends continue to be favorable for the residential sector along with the improving housing sector the commercial and industrial classes continue to grow to show growth of  and  respectively over the rolling  months the commercial sector continues to be supported by office vacancy rate declines and job creation remains strong offsetting this growth is the governmental sector as many agencies face tighter budgets elimination of jobs and adoption of energy efficiency measures as for the industrial sector construction automotives and textiles continue to show strength in the carolinas and midwest other industrial companies continue to reduce production as they work through unusually high inventory levels accumulated in  however the softer global economies and the stronger dollar is still impacting companies that compete globally such as steel and metals our month trends continue to track to our planning assumptions despite a weak first quarter we will continue to closely monitor customer usage patterns as we progress through the year moving to slide nine as we continue to position our company for a low load growth environment id like to spend just a moment discussing the progress that we made in managing costs across the organization so far this year absent the emerging storm costs om is tracking favorable to the prior year which is consistent with our expectations we are focused on standardization of our operational processes and systems to manage our business much more efficiently we also continued to take advantage of the flexibility and cost savings associated with the transition of our generation portfolio from coal to natural gas also within our nuclear and fossil generation fleets were making changes in how we plan and execute our plant outages and how we utilize resources across our fleet although the nuclear promise is an industrywide approach to controlling costs activities are already underway within our nuclear fleet to drive out cost and place more discipline on capital allocation in our transmission and distribution businesses we continue to pursue technology that not only provides greater reliability and information for our customers but also helps control work volumes metering costs and contractor needs ill close with slide  which summarizes our key investor considerations duke energy has tremendous scale offering an attractive investor value proposition which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time as lynn mentioned we are making excellent progress on the acquisition of piedmont and the exit of the international business after the completion of this strategic transition we will operate a portfolio that provides lower risk and higher quality earnings and cash flows to support growth in both earnings and the dividend our strong capital plan includes the transition toward a lower carbon future as we retire coal and build new efficient combined cycle natural gas and renewable resources were excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories particularly in the southeast our electric grid investments allow us to deliver higher levels of reliability and offer new innovative products and services to our customers our dividend is very important to us we continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our longterm  to  earnings growth objective strong cash flows from our core businesses support our dividend we are only one quarter into the year but remain on track to achieve the  to  adjusted earnings per share guidance range for  with that lets open the line for your questions questionandanswer session bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations okay greg i think weve got you first in the queue well go to greg gordon greg operator if you can hear us well go ahead and take qa now lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer we appear that we having some technical difficulty so well wait for a few minutes to see if we can establish the line for questions bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations if everyone could just bear with us for one second they had a fire alarm over at the operators location so just bear with us for a second here operator well take our first question from greg gordon with evercore isi please go ahead greg gordon  evercore group llc hey thanks bill first of all i wanted to say congratulations youve run a fantastic ir program youre leaving it in great hands as well bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations great thank you for that comment greg lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning greg greg gordon  evercore group llc yes good morning how are you so couple of questions on tax so youre ahead of the game on tax and international i was a little bit distracted when you were going through that part of your script so can you rehash whats going on there and does that effectively put you ahead of target for the year for that segment since youre already more than halfway there in the first quarter on your targeted guidance assumptions or is the tax drag yearoveryear from other parts of the business offsetting it and finally youre at a  effective tax rate yeartodate are you still expecting it to be   levelized over the course of the year or is that also trending better lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer so greg let me start with a little explanation on the tax adjustment then ill turn it to steve on specifics around effective tax rate so coming into this year we had the extension of bonus depreciation and then the planned announcement of the exit of international put us in a position where we could relook at the tax consequences of the sale of the business and we are going to be in a position to utilize more of our foreign tax credits which is real economic benefit from the combination of the extension of bonus and the decision to exit and so that economic benefit is being reflecting in the first quarter it does put us ahead of our first quarter plan on international as a result of that but also as we indicated in the script we will begin recognizing tax expense because we will no longer be making the assertion that the proceeds do not come onshore and that tax expense will be reflected over the balance of the year so ahead of plan through the first quarter good economic benefit from the tax planning that the team has accomplished here and ill turn it to steve to talk about effective tax rate steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes we had expected and forecasted an effective tax rate for the year of about  to  i think it will be lower than that you might lower it by  on that range as a result of the tax strategies we put forth related to international greg gordon  evercore group llc okay so some portion of that  will flow back but there will be a net benefit when we look back at the end of the fiscal year is that a fair summary lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thats correct steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes thats true lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thats correct a modest amount will turn greg greg gordon  evercore group llc okay i think i understand thank you guys ill cede to the next question lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer okay thanks so much operator well take our next question from jonathan arnold with deutsche bank please go ahead jonathan philip arnold  deutsche bank securities inc thank you guys that was actually going to be my first question so ill ask my second one which was on the international sale can you give any insight at this stage whether you feel its more likely the assets get sold in one block or in packages or some other structure lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer jonathan were pleased with where we are on the process theres been good market interest in the assets were still in preliminary phases so i cant speak to whether or not the transaction will be a single transaction or a combination our objective will be to optimize the value of the portfolio and as the year progresses well keep you informed on timing and expectations but i would say were off to a solid start on the process jonathan philip arnold  deutsche bank securities inc are you committed to exiting everything or is it possible that there would be a partial sale if that was the better value outcome lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer weve made a decision to exit and are certainly in that process today jonathan and as we move through it well have a better sense of timing and approach so i think thats a question that well be prepared to give more specifics on as the year progresses but again were off to a good start with the degree of market interest were seeing in the assets bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations thank you and thank you to you as well bill and good luck bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations thank you jonathan lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks jonathan operator well go next to steve fleishman with wolfe research please go ahead steve fleishman  wolfe research llc yeah hi good morning steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning steve fleishman  wolfe research llc thanks for that peaceful moment there earlier steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president we didnt know what was going on for awhile lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer i know when we figured out it was a fire alarm it has to be one of the first ever mr currens  on his final call steve fleishman  wolfe research llc yes so well always remember your final call bill so just one other clarification on the international there were bloomberg radio story headlines this morning that seemed to imply there was a comment from that saying that the dilution from the sale would be less than you had thought going forward thats not what you said though here in this call so could you just clarify did you say something about that or is there anything to add there lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer steve thanks for that question so its kind of all a part of this discussion around economic value from this tax adjustment so we still intend believe the transaction will be dilutive well give more visibility on valuation as the process continues but the fact that weve had a tax planning strategy here that has provided an economic value reflected in the first quarter is significant its a combination of bonus and the decision to sell so that was the point i was making but well know more on the valuation of the entire transaction as the year progresses steve fleishman  wolfe research llc okay but there just to im sorry to clarify again so you were referring to the benefit that you got in this first quarter there is not some other tax benefits that occur post sale that we werent lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thats correct steve fleishman  wolfe research llc okay great and then just maybe on the clarifying kind of going back to last call so you had said before the  to  growth rate and its going to be kind of maybe kind of lower toward the beginning of the period then rising toward the end of the period is that still kind of the way you look at it lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thats correct steve steve fleishman  wolfe research llc okay lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer we dont expect linear just given the timing of our capital deployment the approach we take toward rate cases and resetting our prices but over the fiveyear period we believe we have the capital investments the growth initiatives that will drive growth within our  to  targeted range steve fleishman  wolfe research llc okay and then lastly i think piedmont has a stake in the constitution pipeline i mean im sure thats not a huge part of the company but just does that affect much at all your kind of expectations there the delay lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer so weve been following that closely steve and of course are disappointed in the ruling in the state of new york i think the partners in the projects have been very clear on where they are and the fact that they are reviewing a number of options to go forward at this point were planning for a delay in the project but as these options are pursued some of which could include resubmission or appeal through the courts well have a better sense of timing and outcome so more to come on that steve fleishman  wolfe research llc and their stake is like  million is that the right number lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer around  million around  million steve steve fleishman  wolfe research llc okay okay thank you lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator well move next to julien dumoulinsmith with ubs please go ahead julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc hey good morning lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning julien steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc get it started so a few clarifying questions here following up on steves last question how do you think about hitting the bottom end of the range through at least the nearterm period just to kind of clarify that do you expect to be able to hit that  in the subsequent years especially given the yeartodate start and where the sales process is et cetera lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer you know julien i think our guidance on that is as it was at the end of the year we have reaffirmed our range of  to  for this year were in the midst of portfolio transition with the sale of international and the acquisition of piedmont both of which we expect to make substantial progress on in  that will have bearing on  and forward so well give you a better sense of  as we get close were confident in the range we believe it will be nonlinear as weve talked about but dont have anything further to say on that at this point but were working hard on all elements of both growth initiatives capital deployment pursuing rate cases at the right time and moving aggressively through the transition in the portfolio julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc and then a quick followup on pension accounting here weve seen some companies in the sector pursue some new policies on discount rates id be curious is that something you all are reviewing steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president we keep abreast of the various accounting rules and options available to us and those are things that we look at with a regular basis and were keeping an eye on those things were aware of the different methods of selecting discount rates yield curves bond methods spot methods so were keeping an eye on that lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer just no decisions at this point julien those decisions will be finalized in connection with our yearend planning process julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc so would that still affect potentially this year lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer no no decisions have been made at this point steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president no decisions and typically a decision like that would impact prospective years julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc okay thank you and then more strategic question here as you think about the gas expansion that you are undertaking by the acquisition of piedmont how are you thinking about future expansions or exposures on the gas side of the equation and specifically here either more gas utilities or more importantly i suppose the more direct midstream pipeline exposure id be curious lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer julien were excited about what the potential of the piedmont acquisition represents for duke and our focus here in  is on closing the transaction and also progressing atlantic coast pipeline and sabal trail we also see growth within the piedmont franchise both with customer additions as well as infrastructure that would support gas generation here in the carolinas so we expect to continue to build on that platform in particular well look at assets that make sense for duke whether theyre midstream or local distribution companies but dont have anything more specific to share with you at this point were focused on closing the transaction and integrating it in a successful way julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc got it thank you lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator well take our next question from chris turnure with jpmorgan please go ahead lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning chris christopher j turnure  jpmorgan securities llc good morning i had a more specific question on timing for the international sale i do respect that its still relatively early in the process but its my understanding that you really got the ball rolling back in january so its been a couple months now at least you do have those i guess confidentiality agreements in place and you are in discussions maybe it would be helpful to hear a best case scenario here knowing what you know in terms of timing for the ultimate close of the transaction lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer sure and you know chris the ball was rolling in january and february on planning the ball began rolling into the market with discussions with counterparties on nondisclosure agreements and interest more in the late march april timeframe and so we are two months into that process the data room the data book is in the hands of prospective buyers and over the next couple of months well be learning more about degree of interest number of parties that intend to stay in the process and well have more to update in the second quarter i just you know given where we are i dont have any more specifics to share with you jonathan i believe or someone asked earlier about is it one transaction or multiple that of course would impact timing our objective is to optimize the value of the portfolio and were going to move through this in a thoughtful way to accomplish exactly that and well give you more specifics when we are further into the process christopher j turnure  jpmorgan securities llc great and then my second question is on atlantic coast pipeline we did have the delay in the start of construction i guess that you gave some color on in your prepared remarks but the overall cost and completion date remains unchanged is there any more information that you can give us there in terms of the drivers of that delay and start of construction and maybe moving pieces within the lack of change of completion date and lack of change of total costs that might have kind of netted to no effect there i guess lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer chris there has been a very active engagement on the part of the partners throughout this process and the delay in receipt of ferc approval has really been the result of pursuing alternate routes and addressing environmental and stakeholder concerns along the way so the schedule as originally developed had contingency timing in it which weve continued to work actively with our partners including you know the way were engaging with contractors and at this point believe that we are on target for a mid approval from ferc which should give us an ability to continue to target late  for inservice so a lot of good work has been going on to look at a variety of alternatives and to work with the contingency that was within the original project plan christopher j turnure  jpmorgan securities llc okay that makes sense thank you lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from michael lapides with goldman sachs please go ahead michael lapides  goldman sachs  co hey guys lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer hi michael michael lapides  goldman sachs  co couple of easy ones can you all talk about how much utility om was down yearoveryear in the quarter excluding the impact of storms steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes michael the om the nonrecoverable types om was down  yearoveryear in the quarter and again we had about  of storms delta quarteroverquarter offsetting that but we had the  benefit michael lapides  goldman sachs  co okay and then capex in the quarter came in like if i just annualize that number that would imply a yearend number several billion below kind of what you highlighted for  levels should we just assume capex is very backend loaded in the course of this year or is there a kind of downside potential to that capex number steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think our original capital plans for the years are still intact i think its just a shaping during the year lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer and michael if you look back even at  we spent about  of capital last year were kind of in that range this year in the first quarter and then it picks up over the course of the year so the pattern looks similar to what weve experienced in previous years michael lapides  goldman sachs  co got it and then finally can you just remind us what are your thoughts or plans around rate case timing across the various utilities or across your system steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes michael as we had mentioned in the february call were looking at the majority of these cases to be back loaded in the fiveyear timeframe but thats always subject to scrutiny of costs and events that are going on at the time and in fact we are looking at accelerating a rate case we may file a notice this year for our filing for duke energy progress south carolina jurisdiction so were always looking at whats the appropriate time to go in whats our cost structure look like and the investment timing related to that id still say that the majority of the cases are in the back end of the fiveyear timeframe but the south carolina is an example of an opportunity we have that we need to move on perhaps earlier michael lapides  goldman sachs  co got it yeah i asked that question only because if i look at the quarterly demand rather than the rolling  months while its really strong in the carolinas florida has been a little bit weaker and indiana and ohio especially in this quarter were significantly weak on a weather normalized basis lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer michael the rate case timing in florida you may recall we have the gbras in place in connection with the building of the plants and that along with that has a stayout through  i believe and then in indiana weve been pursuing the tdisc the grid investment which will give us an ability to track and that will in hearing hopeful to get approval in indiana which will give us an opportunity to reset prices for those investments and well continue to monitor whether load trends and other things would change our timing in indiana but we believe the tracker that were pursuing is the highest priority rate activity in that jurisdiction michael lapides  goldman sachs  co got it thank you guys much appreciated lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you operator our next question will come from jim von riesemann with mizuho please go ahead james von riesemann  mizuho securities usa inc i am all set thank you lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks jim steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks jim operator well move to our next caller then praful mehta with citi praful mehta  citigroup global markets inc broker hi guys lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer hello steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president hello praful mehta  citigroup global markets inc broker so my quick question was you mentioned on growth on the gas side that you might look at other gas assets so just to clarify are you talking about building on your platform for gas with acquisitions or are you looking for organic growth to build on your gas platform lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer the first objective is to close the sale or close the purchase of piedmont natural gas and we believe that well have organic growth opportunities within that platform not only for new customer additions but expansion of the interstate pipeline system in the carolinas as we continue our strategic move from coal to gas and then beyond that for midstream or ldcs there was a question earlier that address our interest in that we will consider those types of additions to the portfolio that make sense complement what were trying to do but our primary objective is closing the transaction focusing our attention on integration focusing our attention on growth organically as i outlined and then other opportunities well evaluate as they arise praful mehta  citigroup global markets inc broker got you thank you guys thats all i have lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from ali agha with suntrust please go ahead ali agha  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer hello good morning steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president hello ali bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations good morning ali agha  suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning can you remind us for this year the commercial power earnings that youve budgeted how much of that is essentially coming from recognition of tax credits is it almost all of it lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer if you look in the slide deck ali on slide  it gives you the full year assumption for commercial and that business is commercial wind and solar which as you know have tax credits as an important part of their economics so that gives you a range or a perspective on the magnitude of that contribution ali agha  suntrust robinson humphrey inc and lynn what is the mix between itc and ptc recognition there lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer more heavily ptc just because of the nature of our portfolio ali ali agha  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and whats current the average life of contracts on the ptc side steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president on the ptc side we look at ppas that are in the range of typically  to  years in that type of range lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer and the ptc benefit ali as you know is a year benefit ali agha  suntrust robinson humphrey inc yes lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah ali agha  suntrust robinson humphrey inc and you are relatively early in that recognition right for most of the portfolio lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer you know certainly weve been in the business started modestly in  and then you can look at our kind of capital contribution in growth    so i would say early in that ptc period generally ali agha  suntrust robinson humphrey inc yeah and lastly lynn i know when you provide us fullyear guidance you lay out what youre expecting adjusted roes to be across the portfolio as well and in general i mean would you say is there much in terms of because looking at those numbers it doesnt seem to be but is there much in terms of regulatory lag that you would say exists in your portfolio that perhaps can be captured in future years or are you thinking generally speaking the roes will move when you file those rate cases in the back end of the fiveyear forecast lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer let me make a comment and then steve can continue steve commented a moment ago ali that we see the potential for rate cases in south carolina in  thats consistent with capital spending and cost structure and earned returns and so we do have rate case potential in south carolina in the very near term and then later in the fiveyear period in north carolina that will be the result of regulatory lag showing up on capital investment that is occurring now and will occur into the future i commented on trackers in indiana and florida but at some point well address updating those rates as well so i think regulatory lag for any jurisdiction where we have historic test periods or the need to use base rate increases to achieve prices is going to have some regulatory lag associated with it and thats the careful analysis that we closely watch in determining the timing for filing steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president and i would add as we said in february we had a slide on our fiveyear growth and we showed the lag was about  negative and thats an average number over the fiveyear period it will vary year per year and it is as lynn said related to the jurisdictions where youve got gaps between rate cases and you build up investments during those gap periods so were working on that and planning around those events ali agha  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks ali operator well take our next question from paul patterson with glenrock associates please go ahead paul patterson  glenrock associates llc good morning lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning paul paul patterson  glenrock associates llc congratulations again bill bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations thanks paul paul patterson  glenrock associates llc i wanted to just sort of touch base on the storms is there a normal number for storm costs that we should be thinking about in this quarter steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president it is hard to predict storms obviously the past three years weve seen winter storms that have hit us in the range of  million or  million a year but whether thats normal or not i would hesitate to say we try to impute an amount that we think about in our budgeting but youll have during the summer season the potentials for hurricanes in the southeast and then in the winter storms across our jurisdictions other than florida typically theres the potential there hard to predict but weve seen winter storms the past three years in the neighborhood of  million or  million paul patterson  glenrock associates llc okay on slide  it looks like you guys are indicating that for the utilities only about  was impacted by unfavorable weather and i mean is that solely because of it seems – its a little surprisingly it seems a little low does that take into account storm outages that might lower customer usage or because when we look at slide eight it looks like nonweather adjusted sales were down  and i think that does not include leap year correct steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president thats correct yes let me give a little color on this but typically outages from storms do not affect volumes very significantly as one point to make there when youre looking at the whole breadth of things i would say that the i always want to say this when youre looking at a quarter in particular short periods of time you have to be careful about weather normalized data i think the first quarter of  was mild particularly march and i dont know whether we pulled all of the weather impacts out appropriately in the first quarter of  correspondingly the first quarter of  was very very cold and i dont know whether all of the weather was pulled out of that quarter as well so youre comparing these two weather normalized periods and it shows that the weather impact may not have been that significant i suspect that it may have been more mild than what we showed in the first quarter here but i dont try to guess at what that could be so we just roll with the data i like to look at the  months rolling more critically there we did as we acknowledged it it was a bit of a soft quarter but i think the month rolling numbers are in line with what weve been forecasting and i would want to emphasize that in response to a relatively weak load we have aggressively pursued our cost structure to offset that thats part of our longterm plans paul patterson  glenrock associates llc okay great lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer you know paul the only thing i would add to it is we have standard methods of identifying what is weather related and nonweather related and what steve is commenting on is those standard methods can be impacted in periods where there is extreme temperature so extreme cold or extreme warm weather that we experienced in march so that all leads us to look at longer time periods so that we dont have those anomalies that could exist in any quarter and that is really what has led us to this month rolling average discussion on load because we think that is more indicative of trends were experiencing and as you can imagine we watch this really closely and manage the business for a low load growth environment paul patterson  glenrock associates llc excellent thanks a lot lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator and our final question will come from andy levi with avon capital please go ahead andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners hi good morning lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer hi andy steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president hey andy andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners how you guys doing lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer good steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president well bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations yes sir andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners youre one of the best ever even though you never won that award okay i just want to say that i would have given you that award bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations you just gave it to us so thank you andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners okay but maybe next year michael will win it so actually i think most of my questions have been answered but just back on the sales so leap year is what about  basis points on an annual basis is that steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president thats roughly right andy andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners right so i guess for the quarter you times up by four or something like that or is that not the right math steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i think you could get in the ballpark there and its a little thats a rough way to do it andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners right steven k young  chief financial officer  executive vice president but again i think getting weather normalized data is as much art as science and when you get an extreme period like we had in march and comparing it to an extreme period like a prior year i think you can get fluctuations that make that comparison a little distorted we think our customer growth and volumes are in line with our broad prediction levels and well keep an eye on it andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners what do you guys think i mean just in general because its not just you who are seeing like decent customer growth or weak sales trends and its not just this quarter is it still energy efficiency or what else could it be lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer the other thing that we look at andy is multifamily housing versus single family homes were starting to see some positive trends in the carolinas where there are more single family home construction opportunities but coming out of the economic downturn a lot of the growth was in multifamily units which by their footprint use less energy than a home so i think were closely monitoring this and the call to the action for us is to ensure that our cost structure and the way we manage our investments and assets are consistent with the trends were seeing at the top line and we believe we have a demonstrated track record in managing our business that way andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners yeah and then just in general i guess international is doing better than expected part of that is the tax benefit part of that is hydro and then i would assume for the second half of the year youll have some tailwind from currency if things kind of stay where they are so thats a positive for this year but it also seems that the utility itself because of the sales trends and i guess lack of rate increases seems to be towards the low end of your range at this point again its early in the year but is that a fair statement lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer andy were on target for the range of  million to  million that we talked to you about this is the first quarter i think to give you any more specifics on placement within the guidance range is just premature as you know the third quarter is our most significant quarter and were managing the business with identifying rate increase opportunities steve talked about south carolina of course watching costs as part of that and wed like to see a longer trend on the sales growth to continue to monitor where that is progressing so on track to achieve what we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners okay thank you very much and bill again congratulations i think youll be a great controller and keep everyone in the straight and narrow because i guess thats what a controller does and im sure your kids will be happy to spend more time with you than they have for the last few years bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations all right lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks andy bill currens  vice presidentinvestor relations thank you andy andrew levi  avon capitalmillennium partners yes lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer okay operator with that being our last question ill turn the call back to lynn good for closing comments lynn j good  chairman president  chief executive officer okay yolanda thank you and thanks everyone for hanging in with our fire alarm and our

his team to bring in an eventual replacement for his veteran signalcallerrivers turns  at the end of the year and his backup kellen clemens is chargers head coach anthony lynn on philip rivers i dont think hes going to ever retire hes the ultimate competitor and thats how you like it photo by zach bolingericon sportswirei think we do have to get a young quarterback on campus and start to develop someone because we have two veteran quarterbacks and both of them are long in the tooth lynn said i think they have some good years left in them don’t get me wrong but you have to start thinking about down the line tooi would love for a young quarterback to get in here and learn from philip philip is the ultimate pro in my opinion so it would be a good situation for a young quarterback that doesn’t have to come in and play right now but can sit watch and learnthe chargers already have been doing their work on this year’s draft along with offensive coordinator ken whisenhunt and quarterbacks coach shane steichen lynn attended a private workout in lubbock texas for texas tech quarterback patrick mahomeswhisenhunt attended pittsburgh quarterback nathan petermans pro day and the chargers also worked out notre dames deshone kizer and tennessees joshua dobbsthe chargers have selected just one quarterback in the draft under general manager tom telesco  brad sorensen in the seventh round of the  drafthe has the talent to play at the next level lynn said about mahomes he’s a very skillful young man he’s raw a little bit like most college quarterbacks but he’s definitely one that you want waiting on the runwaythe things that you heard about him  it didn’t matter if you talked to the intern the trainer the athletic director or the head coach  you heard heart work ethic and compete they all said those things about him and that’s what you look for in a quarterbacklynn said the most important characteristics he values in a quarterback are accuracy leadership and taking care of the football rivers totaled a careerhigh  interceptions last season but said one of his goals for  is curbing turnoversphilip is the type of guy i think we’re eventually going to have to run off lynn said i don’t think he’s going to ever retire he’s the ultimate competitor and that’s how you like it guys that start talking about they want to play one or two more years those aren’t the type of guys i want to coach i want to coach the ones that want to play foreverkeenan allen making progress lynn said allen is making progress from an acl knee injury that the cal product suffered in the season opener last year against the kansas city chiefs lynn said he doesn’t know if allen will be fullgo once the team’s offseason program begins next week it’s been only been seven months since allen’s surgery he’s doing good lynn said he’s working every day i see him down in the weight room all of the time and out on the field he’s doing welloffensive line competition lynn said the addition of russell okung should improve the play up front along the offensive line however lynn said there will be competition at the guards and center with the possibility of matt slauson moving to his more natural guard position secondyear pros max tuerk and spencer pulley will get an opportunity to compete for starting jobs along with incumbents orlando franklin at left guard and slauson at center the chargers starting right guard is vacant because dj fluker joined the new york giants in free agencypulley and tuerk are two interesting young and developing guys lynn said i’m interested to see how they come along because that could change the whole dynamic of that line slauson could go to guard his natural position one of those guys could take over at center we just don’t know yetandre williams could make an impact one the practice squad for most of last season boston college product williams rushed for  yards filling in for melvin gordon in the chargers last game of the  season against the chiefs the chargers brought back williams in free agency and lynn will give him a chance to compete for the backup job behind gordon lynn said he liked williams coming out of boston college and wants to teach williams some stuff in the receiving game so he can get more touches williams has  career receptions in three nfl seasons it’s harder to teach a guy that during the season lynn said about passcatching for running backs now is when you teach him so we’ll work at that this offseason very hard  receiving is a skill it’s like a golf swing something that can be developed so there’s no
