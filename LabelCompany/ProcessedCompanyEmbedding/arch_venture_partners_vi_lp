development corporation was formed as a notforprofit affiliate corporation dedicated to commercializing promising technology developed in research laboratories at argonne national laboratory and the university steven lazarus was recruited to lead the new organization with the broad mandate to license promising technology and promote the formation of spinoff companies in  robert nelsen and keith crandell joined lazarus to focus on new company formation together they pioneered a successful commercialization strategy that benefited both the university and the scientists behind the research very importantly they recognized the need to create a venture capital fund to support the formation of spinoff companies as the midwest did not support a strong early stage venture capital community at the time shortly thereafter in  arch raised its first venture fund in late  lazarus crandell and nelsen formed arch venture partners in a friendly separation agreement with the university of chicago which became a special limited partner and investor in the new venture capital firm arch development corporation remained within the university as its technology transfer arm a year later clinton bybee an experienced seed investor and colleague from arch development corporation dating back to  joined as archs fourth partner as a team archs founding partners are unique sharing more than  years of
