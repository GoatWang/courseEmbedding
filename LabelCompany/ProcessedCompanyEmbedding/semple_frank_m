slide three weve also included disclosures on the announced business combination between markwest and mplx we encourage you to carefully read the registration and joint proxy statements as they contain important information about the proposed merger now this merger which ill discuss in a minute will be the next major milestone for markwest weve spent the last  years creating significant value for our customers and our unitholders and the strategic opportunities and commercial synergies created by this merger will be tremendous so beginning with our operational and financial highlights on slide four our strong record of customer service continues to distinguish us an industryleading midstream company for  producers across the nation voted markwest number one for total satisfaction in the annual energy point research midstream survey weve achieved this top ranking in every survey theyve conducted since  and our customerfocused culture coupled with our operational excellence are the main reasons for our successful organic growth strategy in highperformance shale plays total system volumes reached a new record  billion cubic feet per day an increase of  over last quarter and  from the same period of last year since june we have increased our total processing capacity by over  to  billion cubic feet per day and we maintained average utilization of  during the third quarter distributable cash flow was  million and adjusted ebitda was  million we increased our quarterly distribution to  per common unit with a coverage ratio of  times which was impacted by  million yeartodate of mergerrelated expenses without this nonrecurring cost our coverage ratio would have been just under one times from a commercial standpoint we continue to complete new projects and execute major agreements in existing and new areas where we have synergies and our producers economics are compelling were excited about the completion of an expansion at the carthage complex in east texas because our existing facilities at this location were operating at capacity in addition we announced new agreements to support the buildout of gathering infrastructure for ascent resources dry gas development in the utica shale and newfield explorations crude oil production from their prolific stack play in the canawoodford slide five highlights the key value drivers and the status of our merger with mplx the master limited partnership sponsored by marathon petroleum corporation this transaction will create a highgrowth diversified investment grade mlp once the merger is completed markwest will become a whollyowned subsidiary of mplx and our industryleading organic growth program will be combined with their expanding downstream logistics business and marathons  billion of currently identified dropdown ebitda as the largest refiner in the midwest and fourth largest in the nation marathons financial strength operational capabilities and strong support as the general partner would will drive tremendous opportunities we expect the combined entity to generate a mid compound annual distribution growth rate through  we have cleared important hurdles including hsr and sec review and last friday we filed the definitive proxy statement a special unitholder meeting has been set for december  and we are excited to complete the transaction and begin the important work of integrating our businesses developing critical midstream projects for our customers and delivering significant unitholder value now on slide six we illustrate the power of the strategic combination between markwest and mplx including the substantial growth opportunities for the combined company markwest is the second largest processor in the us operating in some of the most economic shale plays the combined company with the support of mpc has the ability to expand our organic growth model and develop significant commercial opportunities we anticipate the potential to deploy  billion to  billion of incremental capital investments beyond our estimated  billion in annual organic capex through  the opportunities for our two companies are especially strong in the northeast where the marcellus and utica are currently supplying almost a quarter of all total us natural gas production and approximately  billion cubic feet per day of new pipeline projects are being developed to support future growth from the region in addition to gas the northeast is forecasted to produce over  of total us ngl production by  positioning the region as an important global energy and petrochemical hub we have built the premier midstream footprint in the marcellus and utica and our facilities provide the critical link to connecting gas and liquids to downstream end markets supporting the remarkable production growth the basin has experienced over the past five years we currently process and fractionate about three quarters of total rich gas production in the northeast and our processed volumes have grown to over  billion cubic feet per day now next phase of infrastructure required in the region will extend from gathering processing and fractionation and into projects that increase regional demand and create access to both domestic and international markets while were focused in the northeast and midwest the gulf coast also provides extensive opportunities to developed midstream infrastructure to support marathons significant refining and marketing operations transitioning to our segment review slide seven summarizes the marcellus where we currently process and fractionate  of the rich gas production and we continue to grow our position as the leading midstream service provider we currently operate  billion cubic feet per day of capacity and while the rate of growth of marcellus rich gas production has moderated due to the current commodity price environment our total volumes in  are expected to increase  over  and we still expect volumes to increase by another  in  as indicated utilization was  during the third quarter even though we completed three additional gas plants at the very end of the second quarter we will continue to complete facilities on a justintime basis to match capacity with the ongoing requirements of our customers utilization of these new facilities will increase over our typical month to month timeframe as producer gas volumes continue to grow as the largest processor and fractionator in americas most productive shale resource our capex continues to be focused on the rich gas areas however we are also well positioned to continue working with our producers development efforts in the core dry gas areas of southwest pennsylvania and northern west virginia moving to slide eight growth in our utica segment remains very strong utica processed volumes increased by  over the last quarter and we forecast an approximate  increase in volumes in  we currently operate  billion cubic feet per day of processing in the rich gas core of the utica and by the end of this year we expect total processing capacity to be operating at approximately  utilization in addition to processing we continue expanding our infrastructure to support the efficient production and marketing of liquids our condensate stabilization facility in cadiz ohio has become a key hub in the rich utica and marcellus we support multiple parties at this facility including marathon gulfport and twin eagle and our  barrel per day of capacity is nearly fully utilized with stabilized condensate being delivered to end users both regionally and internationally ultimately this highvalue feedstock will be transported via the mplx cornerstone pipeline a project that will be completed in late  on slide nine you can see the dramatic growth of our utica gas gathering partnerships with emg and summit todate weve constructed  miles of pipeline and operate over  horsepower of fuel compression in six counties our gathered volumes have grown to over  million cubic feet per day for the third quarter and we expect total gathered volumes to double from  to  as shown on slide  we are well positioned with two strategically located dry gas gathering hubs which we believe are in the best areas of the play in may we began gathering gulfports dry gas from southern belmont and northern monroe counties and in august we announced an expansion of our utica dry gas gathering infrastructure to support ascent resources together with emg we will construct a largescale gathering system primarily in jefferson county the ultimate design capacity of this new system is over  billion cubic feet per day with more than  miles of pipeline and  horsepower of compression weve already begun our initial construction and expect to begin flowing gas by the end of this year were working with accent to optimize the capital required to support their drilling program which will allow us to complete facilities on a justintime basis now beyond gathering and processing we also remain focused on meeting our producer customers fractionation requirements on slide  weve included a combined overview of our marcellus and utica fractionation operations during the third quarter total fractionation volumes exceeded  barrels per day the vast majority of liquids that we fractionate are propane and heavier volumes and we operate  barrels per day of c capacity our facilities at houston hopedale and keystone are highly utilized averaging  during the third quarter ethane recovery continues to be critical for allowing producers to meet residue gas quality pipeline specifications and fulfill existing downstream commitments and we currently operate  barrels per day of deethanization capacity purity ethane produced in the marcellus and utica is already moving to petrochemical markets in canada on mariner west and to the gulf coast through the atex pipeline when mariner east is completed it will mark the first deliveries of purity ethane from the northeast to the expanding petrochemical market in europe northeast ethane will become an important supply source as worldscale cracker projects are developed in the northeast and around the globe moving to slide  we provide an overview of our southwest business unit as shown in the table utilization of our facilities remained strong at  during the third quarter of  in the haynesville shale producers remain very active our facilities in east texas are highly utilized and gas volumes continue to grow in order to support producers continued rich gas development we completed an expansion of the carthage complex in october increasing our total capacity in east texas to  million cubic feet per day in western oklahoma utilization of our processing facilities are benefiting from the rapid growth occurring in the highly economic canawoodford shale producer activity in this area has increased significantly as the multiple geologic horizons of this play are generating strong results for oil and associated gas production we currently support newfields development of their stack area and in june we connected our cana gathering assets to the arapaho processing complex with a mile highpressure pipeline we have continued to expand our gathering system and have connected over  wells in addition we recently executed a new agreement with newfield to begin crude oil gathering in the same area in the permian we have started construction of our new hidalgo plant to support cimarex and chevron in the delaware basin and we expect to begin operations in the second quarter of next year the permian is the most prolific oil basin in the us and production from the delaware is rapidly increasing markwests focus on supporting producers in emerging shale plays began in texas and oklahoma and were excited about the opportunity for continued growth throughout the southwest in  we forecast average processed volumes will increase by approximately  driven by growth in existing areas such as the haynesville as well as growth in new areas including the canawoodford and the permian concluding our operational review were very pleased on the continued optimization of our assets in todays commodity price environment our fullservice suite of assets in many of our nations best resource plays together with the largest and most diverse producer customer base continues to drive strong performance and the ability to generate stable growth over the long term now moving to our financial summary on slide  maintaining financial flexibility continues to be important given the current market conditions today we have over  million of liquidity and during the third quarter weve raised approximately  million of equity we continue to utilize our atthemarket program to access the equity markets and in october we raised an additional  million our capex deployment has slowed significantly and we are well positioned to support our capital program through the middle of next year in addition to our ongoing focus on capital optimization we have a number of options available to fund our growth capital program these options include raising equity capital through the public markets and private markets and utilizing the capital flexibility provided by our joint venture partners as always we will continue to focus our efforts on maintaining a strong balance sheet supporting our ongoing organic growth program and achieving our longterm distribution growth objectives turning now to our financial forecast on slide  our dcf and adjusted ebitda forecast for  remains unchanged we expect dcf in a range of  million to  million and our adjusted ebitda forecast remains at a range of  million to  million we expect our  capital expenditures to be approximately  billion which is at the low end of our previous range of  billion to  billion were also providing our  forecast which is based on our expectations for producer volumes forecasted commodity prices and our strategy of deploying capital on a justintime basis we forecast  dcf in a range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda in a range of  billion to  billion we forecast  capex will be in a range of  million to  billion included in our earnings release is our sensitivity table showing the projected ranges of  dcf based on our volume and ngl price forecast feebased income has continued to increase and is expected to be approximately  in  for our commodity exposed margin we maintain an active hedging program and are currently  hedged for  transitioning to slide  you will see our successful history of growing the distribution and weve been able to achieve a  compound annual growth rate since our ipo in  we currently forecast a distribution growth rate of  in  and expect to achieve an annual distribution growth rate of  to  from  to  our distribution expectations are based on the projected producer customer drilling programs as well as our forecasted commodity prices which are in line with the thirdparty sources such as bentek cmai and purvin so in closing the markwest team continues to focus on operational excellence and bestofclass customer service and the merger with mplx will create significant commercial synergies financial flexibility and strategic growth opportunities as a combined company supported by the strong balance sheet extensive dropdown inventory and diverse asset base of marathon petroleum we are exceptionally well positioned to continue executing on behalf of our customers and deliver longterm value for our unitholders so with that paul ill open it up to questions questionandanswer session operator yes sir here we will now begin the qa session of todays call all right for the questions we do have ms kristina kazarian on the line maam your line is now open you may now proceed kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc congrats on the newfield add but first a question on the longer term so you lowered guidance for  in the bottom end of the range for  plus what are like the drivers in messaging here frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer you are correct kristina we have lowered our guidance for  and reconfirmed our ability to reach that  to   through  and really kristina thats just a function of the current market conditions primarily the significant reduction in commodity prices that has as you know impacted our producers capex in many of our areas but specifically where it impacts us the most is up in the marcellus and the utica so as you would expect as our producer customers modify their capex as a result of lower commodity prices that has an impact on our operating income our dcf and adjusted ebitda in  but clearly we expect the commodity price environment to improve moving into  and thats the reason why we still are messaging and confident in our ability to return to that  to  distribution growth rate kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc yeah and then sounds like the utica dry system i know you talked about it earlier is going well especially with the august add of the ascent contract how should i be thinking about capex required to build the  bcf system whats the timeframe to getting to full capacity and potential for other commitments frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer well youve picked up on the key term ultimately we are planning a system designing a system that can accommodate  bcf which is driven by the outstanding acreage position and the quality of the acreage by ascent so pretty clear line of sight on the construction and development of the projects that are going to be required to support that but that would be over a multiyear period of time and so for  thats going to be a very modest amount of money probably about less than  million would be required to support the initial phase of construction and well give you more information kristina as we are moving into the year based on the performance of the wells and also ascents updates on their drilling program kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc okay and then can you talk about the nfx announcement i know its near an existing rich gas system but its a bit of step out for you guys with mdc as a potential parent should i be thinking about more crude gathering now that you guys have a dedicated downstream customer or am i thinking about that wrong frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer well were very excited about the newfield performance in their stack play certainly they started out very strong with their drilling program as i indicated in my formal comments they are as you will listen – as you listen to newfield describe their acreage position and the quality of their reserves in stack play these are outstanding wells and have great economics so were very excited to extend and expand our relationship with newfield starting initially with the associated gas and moving into the oil transportation so as i said earlier weve connected  wells moving a lot of gas up to our arapaho plant and getting close to connecting the oil transportation pipeline up near the cushing area so yeah thats all going very well kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc and then last one from me just a quick update on the merger process i know i asked mplx is one too but have you guys started out working with the proxy solicitor yet and do we get interim update as this process is going along or do we just find out the results at the very end frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer well weve gone effective and mailed our proxies out and we are in the solicitation process and dont plan to provide updates publicly but stay tuned on the ongoing the progress its going well and we look forward to completing the merger kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc sounds great nice job on the new contract jobs guys frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator all right speakers for the next question this comes from the line of mr michael blum sir your line is now open you may now proceed michael blum  wells fargo securities llc thanks good morning guys first question is so kind of the if i understand correctly the fiveyear guidance for growth capex is  billion per year as a baseline within the merger contract but now  youre saying is  million to  billion so does that mean that each year now is  million to  billion or is it still the  billion per year going forward frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer its still the  billion over the fiveyear period that was discussed and provided in the s again as i alluded to in my formal comments the  capital program is being designed and developed in support of the current producers drilling programs across our operating areas but most of the capex as you know michael is being spent up in the marcellus and utica so weve had to temper our capex going into  we have as indicated on the slides we have utilization in kind of the mid range and so were going to grow into that that capacity as the volumes continue to ramp up in the marcellus and utica we like to be in that  plus utilization range and so the issue around the capex in  is really in ensuring that we are completing our future projects our future gas plants in particular and fractionation facilities based on the volume ramp up by the producers so we just have this year where commodity prices have tempered the rate of growth we have a lot of available capacity were going to grow into that and then as the commodity price environment improves in late  and  and more importantly when a lot of these pipeline projects both gas and ngl projects come on line later – not for gas throughout  and for natural gas liquids for the mariner east  project coming on line later in  we see a significant improvement in netbacks to the producers later in the year so were very confident about being able to ramp back up to the plus billion of capital based on all of our organic growth and also our visibility into producers drilling programs our rich gas development as you heard in my formal comments is being complemented with additional dry gas development and so we continue to be very confident about our ability to achieve a run rate of around  billion of capex for organic growth projects again not only from the northeast but also down our southwest business unit i mean – were very excited about the permian were excited about the scoop and stack plays in central oklahoma and just ongoing rampup in east texas around our carthage facilities michael blum  wells fargo securities llc great thank you frank frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator all right speakers one moment please all right for the next question this comes from the line of tj schultz sir your lines are open tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc great maybe just following on the last point and if i look at the appendix in your presentation and that typical slide with projects under construction it seems like some projects are pushed out a bit and i understand the justintime nature approach but really if you could just generally comment on your discussions with producers to get some confidence level on this current timeline or how much more visibility you still may need on  producer plans to firm up a better sense of capital you deploy next year so maybe when do you expect to narrow that range on capex for next year which is pretty wide right now frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer sure tj as you know from listening to the producers public comments during their third quarter earnings calls youre getting a sense of the timing and the status of their  capital programs theyre starting to firm up those plans but theyre very much dependent on two things the commodity price environment and the timing of the pipeline projects that i mentioned earlier both gas and liquids so in many cases – and you just as you always do tj just go back and read the transcripts but youll see that in many cases theyre providing a pretty wide range themselves on capex depending on those very same issues most of these producers in the marcellus and the utica have done a great job of optimization of deploying technology driving down their costs but also making decisions around firm capacity on these new projects to reach the premium markets for their gas and their liquids so theres a lot of dependencies on how the market goes and dependencies on these projects but – and thats the reason again for our – sort of the wide range of capex for our business but we will continue as we always do to update you every quarter and we will give you a much better picture after – at the end of our fourth quarter in terms of how  is shaping up but we do have a lot of visibility into their drilling programs their decisions all the way driven by these factors all the way back to the type curves so the good news here is that these positions that our producer customers have in all the areas that we operate are very economic many hedges many of the producers have hedges in place and they continue to deploy capital to run their rigs or grow their business but they as you know they have to be in the right places and fortunately we have to be located in some great shale plays unconventional resource basins as well as some great customers that are executing very well so i feel pretty good about our  forecast for capex but you will see us making decisions on the timing of those plans to ensure that they do not come on too early that we maintain high utilization rates and maximize our ability to grow our distributions tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc okay thanks i guess just lastly on guidance and if i read the various standalone scenarios in the deal proxy correctly you assume at least  times distribution coverage in  and beyond even in a low case was still stepping up the distribution growth rate that you laid out is that coverage still the goal in a standalone scenario or are there any changes in your low case cash flow estimates that would impact coverage expectations frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer that is still our goal is to maintain a  to  coverage ratio over the long term on a standalone basis tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc okay thank you frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks tj operator all right speakers for the next question this comes from the line of ms becca followill maam lines are open james carreker  usca securities llc hi actually its james carreker in for becca big picture just kind of curious as to how you guys think about a rebound in commodity prices in  to support the  to  distribution growth in the drilling plans of all the upstream producers what does that mean to you guys frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer well as far as the projections for the commodity price recovery that i mentioned earlier the starting point for that perspective really comes from the kind of the broader macro view of the industry from a supplydemand standpoint thats driving the projections for the major third parties that are providing those forecasts bentek cmai and pira we utilized for the outyears heavily to just help to bracket our forecast for commodity prices and as you know we are expecting to see – the industry is expecting to see recovery for natural gas liquids prices based on those forecasts most importantly james the issue in the northeast again where the majority of our capital is being spent is – the most important issue are the netbacks to the producers based on the markets that theyre able to access for their gas and their natural gas liquids their purity products which we are – for the majority of the volumes being processed and fractionated in the northeast we are responsible for marketing the liquids in the northeast for our producer customers so netbacks are very much impacted by the ability to continue to debottleneck the northeast ngls and as i mentioned in my formal comments there are a lot of new projects coming on line we are working every single day on small incremental projects to continue to improve the netbacks relative to belvieu for those purity products for our customers so the broader question for ngls is the belvieu recovery that were expecting but also we will continue to talk about how important it is for these new projects to continue to come on line for natural gas liquids and natural gas residue that is so critical to continue to improve the margins in the netbacks for the producers in the area and there is a lot of help on the way  bcf a day of new pipeline projects almost  bcf this year has come on line just over the last  months and thats helped tremendously in some areas of the northeast basin and so same issues on ngls obviously ethane is in pretty good shape from a transportation and access to markets perspective but the c purity products the next big tranche of capacity to the water will be the mariner east  project actually mariner east  is scheduled to be completed late this year and that will help but mariner east  will provide a significant improvement and as i said we are as youve seen in our public information were working on a number of other ngl transportation logistics marketing projects to help access the premium markets in  and beyond james carreker  usca securities llc sure appreciate that color and i guess if i could prod you just a little bit to put some specifics around ngl prices even if its mont belvieu and you assume away kind of some of the bigger bottlenecks and you get some longerterm solutions in there can you put like a range maybe on what an ngl barrel needs to be worth even in mont belvieu to kind of incentivize these emps to switch back to wet gas frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer well let me just try to answer it this way if we were trading at belvieu today in the northeast the producers would be making very different decisions relative to their rich gas continuation of the rich gas development so the economics are so compelling in the marcellus and the utica for rich gas production and development that what we need to do is what i just described is we need to continue to work with our producer customers and other sponsors of pipeline and logistic projects to ensure that the purity products are trading closer to belvieu and if that – if we were trading overall in  at a belvieu less transportation that was more along the lines of our historical basis differential then dry gas would be much less of a factor in the producers capital programs so we are obviously very sensitive to how we can impact that delta that basis differential and working on a number of projects the mplx merger is a great example of our focus longterm on how to improve the overall economics for our producer customers not only in the midwest and the northeast but also in the gulf coast we have the ability with higher customer relationships our core operations and with the merger completed we will be able to not only drive a lot of these new projects whether theyre pipeline transportation logistics projects or inbasin ngl projects refined product projects feedstock projects such as condensate stabilization additional natural gasoline capabilities alkylate we have the ability with the right partner which is marathon and mplx to drive those kinds of projects so belvieu is a key index no doubt about it but even if belvieu stays flat for the next several years we have the ability and are working on projects on how to improve that – the netbacks by getting – providing more inbasin capabilities demand through the projects that ive described and also providing more access to premium markets including exports on the delaware river so all the above is necessary in northeast and if we do that and the producers drilling in the rich gas area because of their fundamental economics will be in great shape james carreker  usca securities llc thank you appreciate that thats all from me frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator all right speakers for the next question comes from the line of tristan richardson sir your lines is now open mr richardson sir your line is now open you may now proceed tristan richardson  suntrust robinson humphrey inc can you guys hear me hello frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning tristan richardson  suntrust robinson humphrey inc sorry apologize just a question on the dry gas system frank appreciate youve kind of given the initial sub  million spend and that is – is that the jv spend or is that markwest proportional and then is that included in your  capex outlook that you guys gave this morning frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah it is included in our capex forecast and its on a ths basis so you can kind of do the math around that tristan richardson  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got you okay thats helpful and then in terms of – talking about the construction project slide it looks like in addition to some movement of several of the projects a few that were slated to come on line in q previously are now looking to come on line in q  and then but you maintain the capex spend for  im curious just sort of how that aligns what takes the place of that or is it – am i reading too much into sort of the timing of when things come on line frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer we provide that math in the appendix for that very very reason so you can see quartertoquarter how we made adjustments in our timing tristan richardson  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer and so yeah so the major change i think is the mobley facility mobley gas plant tristan richardson  suntrust robinson humphrey inc right frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer and as we move through the year because of that wide range of capex – capex guidance that we provided it is very critical that we keep you updated on how those – the timing of those plants will be impacted by the continued volume ramps of our producer customers so well keep you updated tristan richardson  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you guys very much frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator all right speakers for the next question is comes from the line of mr jeremy tonet your lines are open sir you may now proceed unknown speaker hi good morning its actually andy  on the line for jeremy i was hoping you could provide some commentary into the sequential decline in marcellus processing volumes and whether this was in line with your internal expectations and kind of what the nearterm indicators youre looking to going forward that gives you comfort for your volume ramp assumptions frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah – its been basically flat quarteroverquarter and that was no surprise again we are closely tied into the producers forecast and their drilling programs and youre seeing some of this being a little bit choppy because of the point that i made earlier about downstream pipelines one of our producer customers for instance made the decision and for good reason to drill and not complete a number of wells waiting on the completion of a new downstream pipeline and so in our – if you look back to our second quarter forecast we expected at that point in time to have those wells completed and these are big wells by the way and have those on line by the – by the even the third quarter so thats one event and there are several more examples like that caused kind of a flat result in  – or in the third quarter but as we move into the end of the fourth quarter and into  youll see a lot of these new projects coming on line im talking about residue projects as well as ngl projects and many of those projects are committed with firm capacity from the producer so youll see the rampup return in the first quarter and we feel very confident about our ability to hit these volume numbers for  unknown speaker okay frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer the producers are again theyre doing a great job of optimization and its not just optimization around the well head its optimization around their downstream commitments market access netbacks so youll see a lot of decisions being driven by all of those factors and well keep you updated on how those decisions are being made and the impact on our forecast unknown speaker no thats helpful commentary thank you and when you say that youre kind of linked into your customers production plans and youre sidebyside with them and youre linked up can you try to quantify the scope of that visibility do you have pretty good sense of a couple quarters out or is it a year out or im just trying to get a sense of when that can kind of go dark and when your guess is as good as ours almost frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer well its a multiyear planning process but it is continual we are joined at the hip for all the reasons that weve discussed we depend on our producers and they depend on us so we have developed a process and relationship with our producers to ensure that we have a longterm view recognizing that it changes weekly and so our forecasts are based on all that information thats provided to us its all proprietary but its all based around ensuring that we are there when they need us and that we are not overbuilding in that we are able to optimize our capital the same as they are doing so that visibility is really critical unknown speaker great and then sticking on the marcellus and utica on this last question the eclipse sic ascent gathering deal was clearly a nice addition to the backlog i guess first question how much additional new business do you think is out there to win nonexisting customers and then kind of second part to the question is given the recent shift in ma and competitive landscape within your business lines in the marcellus and utica do you worry about new or more aggressive competitors trying to expand in the area over the next few years for potentially fewer and fewer projects frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer i believe you meant the ascent complement but the ascent transaction is a great example of how we are able to take our existing relationship with an existing customer like ascent and grow that as they continue to expand their acreage positions in this case in the utica our initial ascent relationship was based around their rich gas development program and as they continue to acquire acreage and complete their science and their decisions around expanding their drilling program they came to us and we came to them also and just were a critical part of their discussions for what their requirements were going to be and how we were going to support their midstream requirements so having said that we have relationships with all the major producers in the marcellus and the utica they understand our capabilities those capabilities are full service including the very critical issue that we spent a lot of time discussing today and that is the marketing of their commodities natural gas liquids are critical for their economics and so its very critical that were able to provide the full range of services for them but the marcellus and the utica combined are the largest producing gas deals in the us and so there are a lot of midstream companies that clearly have footholds and have capabilities in the marcellus and utica and they have a clear intent as we do to continue to expand our market share so we wake up every day trying to figure out how to outcompete everyone else and weve done a good job of that i think a big part of that is because of the relationships because of the credibility we have and this very complete set of assets that are so critical for the producer customers to maximize their investment and again ive been talking about the marcellus and utica but that applies in all the areas that we operate i can say the same things about why we were at the table and successful with the hidalgo plant in the permian that really came from our reputation since we did not have core assets in that area our reputation was a big part of our ability to expand our relationship with cimarex and chevron and build this gas plant out there so yes it is a very competitive market but again we feel like were in a very good position moving forward to continue to capture a significant part of the continued growth in these highperformance shale plays and again ill come back to the mplx merger that is going to simply enhance our ability to compete its going to allow us with a stronger balance sheet with a parent that is not only very supportive but also able to drive a significant amount of demand in the areas that marathon operates in the midwest and in the gulf coast so were all about continuing to expand our set of tools our set of capabilities to support the producer customers and the merger that ive discussed is a really critical part of allowing us to not only drive those new projects but also participate in those projects from an investor perspective unknown speaker great thanks very much and thanks for ascent correction thats it from us frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator all right sir for the next question this comes from the line of ms helen ryoo maam your line is now open you may now proceed helen jung ryoo  barclays capital inc yes thank you good morning most of my questions were answered but frank i guess i have a question and this is more about the mechanics of how these things work rather than whether a certain scenario would pan out or not but if there is a cash sweetener for the mplx deal in the form of lets say a special dividend or whatnot could you do it without delaying the vote date or does it have to go through proxy and therefore it has to get refiled and have to push out the vote date frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer well helen you probably will anticipate my answer i just cant comment im not going to speculate on what may happen in the future and i realize helen youre asking about the mechanics but its really inappropriate for me to comment on that at all i will say though that in the event that there is any new or additional information relevant to the merger that i spent so much time on talking about as you know the sec rules requires supplements to the proxy to be filed and made available to the unit holders for their review so again i understand youre asking about just the mechanics of the process but i just cant comment on anything that may or may not happen in the future helen jung ryoo  barclays capital inc okay understood and then i guess the question about the incremental  billion to  billion capex on the combined entity would that capex – could that be spent as early as  and if so whats your latest thought on who gets to spend that capex is it more likely to take place at the mpc level given i guess there is sort of a capital market issue going on right now so maybe theres not a whole lot of ability to take on too much capex and go beyond like the  billion upper end of the range that youve talked about so maybe could you talk about this a little bit frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer sure helen and maybe for the benefit of the other listeners let me try to frame the  billion to  billion question up a little bit that range of capex driven by some very specific and very exciting projects that really has been a part of our discussions with mplx and marathon as weve talked about the significant value of the merger between markwest and mplx we also have talked about really the three – that  billion to  billion has been one of the three major areas of growth when you think about the combined entity on a pro forma basis being able to deliver this mid compound annual growth rate for distributions for mplx those three components include the  billion of dropdown ebitda that have currently been identified and thats growing the second component involves the point that was brought up earlier the  billion of approximate organic growth capex coming from our growth engine around these highperformance shale plays and then the third component of the future growth for mplx would be the ability to execute on a number of incremental projects both ngl projects and natural gas projects that are outside of our core area of capability from a balance sheet standpoint and in some cases outside of our capabilities just from the standpoint of operations and construction and those are projects like the alkylization project that we with mplx and marathon have been talking about constructing at our hopedale facility so the line of sight is pretty clear the  billion to  billion of projects have been a part of and a function of all of our discussions with marathon and mplx and again they range from the alkylization project to natural gas liquids pipeline projects to natural gas liquids terminal projects to additional condensate projects to propane dehydrogenation projects in the northeast and maybe other areas olefin projects down in the gulf coast and perhaps at our javelina facility a lot of these are in planning stages but as we roll out from the merger and we complete the integration of the two companies then you will hear more and more about the status of these projects but it is very achievable your question about where these projects get financed marathon and mplx gary heminger has been very clear in their earnings calls that were conducted last week about their commitment to this merger their support for this merger the many areas that they feel will drive significant improvement in natural gas liquids pricing and provide us a lot of growth opportunities together on a standalone basis markwest continues to drive a lot of organic growth but as you know helen there is a limit to our balance sheet flex and while a lot of these projects that i mentioned should get built and will get built without a stronger balance sheet we will not be able to participate and drive those projects for our producer customers so the merger has been a key part of the ability to continue to drive the value of markwest energy units in the marketplace and also to improve the overall economics of our producer customers in all the areas that we operate so were very excited about that i know thats a lengthy answer but the financing part of this is really going to be a function of optimization on a goforward basis which balance sheet whether its mplx or mpc is best positioned to support those projects obviously we want to be as efficient as possible with the future mplx balance sheet and support as many of these organic growth projects and projects that we can on that balance sheet but the support from mpc and the incubation and the ability to incubate projects at the mpc level is a critical part of the value proposition for this merger because mpc has the ability to as theyve done with others dropdown projects to finance at their level and then ultimately drop those down to the mlp so theres a lot of financial operational and commercial synergies that are a result of this merger and again were just really focused on getting to the finish line completing the merger start the integration of the two companies and really continuing with the development of all these projects whether theyre organic or theyre dropdown or they are like i said these incremental upside projects that are so critical to the marketplace helen jung ryoo  barclays capital inc and my last question is on your revised longterm distribution growth guidance which got adjusted down a little bit from  to  to  longer term how much of that is your volume forecast driven versus a cost of capital driven because i mean since youve started to lay the longterm guidance your cost of capital has gone up quite a bit especially on the equity side so i dont know how much of that is sort of putting pressure on that numbers maybe you could talk about that a little bit please frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer well certainly the forecast in those outyears is a function of many things but its primarily driven by volumes its primarily driven by the producers continued success in the areas that we operate and i touched previously on all the reasons that we are comfortable with our volume forecast that drives that to distribution growth but weve also helen certainly looked at the standalone yield that markwest would trade at in those outyears and as you would expect weve run sensitivities around all those major factors but again were more focused right now on getting through this merger and ensuring that we can execute on these set of the projects and growth opportunities because its not only important for our unit holders but its really important for our producer customers to have a partner with mplx with markwest being a key part of that equation who can continue to drive value for their drilling programs in the areas that they operate helen jung ryoo  barclays capital inc all right got it thank you very much frank frank m semple  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks helen operator all right sir i will now turn the call over back to mr frank semple for the closing remarks fse frank
