that offer attractive returns and therefore considering products that differ from traditional investments although not necessarily seeking full principal protection thus products that enhance these yields such as autocall products have become increasingly popular with investors according to deng et al  there has been a sharp increase in their use with  annual growth recorded between  and  more than  autocall products were issued during the first six months of  according to baule et al  bergstresser  deng et al  and henderson and pearson  one of the reasons for this increase in autocall products is the ease with which they can be indexed to the products acting essentially as a marketlinked investment that faces ‘forced redemption’ before the scheduled maturity date if certain predetermined market conditions are achieved drawing on georgieva’s  considerations regarding structured products and adapting these ideas to autocall dynamics one may add a few more benefits of using this tool such as using it to hedge at a minimum or maximum level when hedging instruments are not available in the shortterm market take on risk judiciously in order to obtain higher returns diversify in order to manage risk in the case of autocall with more than one asset avoid problems with potential market impact due to significant changes in asset allocation amongst others an autocall event occurs on predetermined dates which can occur at annual quarterly intervals etc specific for each type of product that can mature on the autocall date the latter may be continuous or discrete as shown in figure a and b in the case of a continuous autocall date the product can only be autocalled when it attains the barrier during its whole duration whereas in the discrete case there are certain ‘autocall dates’ on which the product may or may not face ‘forced redemption’ depending on its position in relation to the barrier level the latter is characteristic of the vale sa product analysed with its predetermined dates the underlying reference index s can be linked to the price of stocks a basket of stocks or funds amongst others such that if it reaches price level ‘c’ the company exercises the option to purchase the product which is then automatically redeemed with the investor receiving the predetermined coupon initially agreed upon by contract along with the principal invested autocall structured products  figure  autocall in continuous and discrete periods a continuous autocall b discrete autocall see online version for colours a b source citifirst – informações sobre termos e condições in figure  examples the products were subject to autocall before the maturity date most autocall products have a protection feature so that if the autocall trigger has not occurred before the scheduled maturity date the capital is fully protected and the investor receives all interest due provided the price is greater than or equal to the barrier level however if s is below this level investors will be fully exposed to downside of the market and may suffer heavy losses thus is important to necessary to understand that the autocall product necessarily includes a put option on the maturity date it is also interesting to observe that the ‘small’ period of time that has elapsed since its creation has seen the development of several variations of the original autocall model such as performance autocall crescendo autocall escalator autocall bonus autocall and the premium express with all of them influenced by characteristic instruments used to calculate payments on coupon dates this article is divided into six sections after this introduction section  presents the model developed to analyse the pricing of the autocall product issued by vale sa as well as a review of the literature aimed at gaining a deeper knowledge of autocall mechanisms the third provides a detailed explanation of the study’s title section  presents the methodology used and important data the section  shows the empirical results obtained and section  presents the study’s conclusions  theoretical references this section performs an indepth analysis of themes related to the models used for the pricing of autocall structured products which are the trinomial tree and finite difference models it will also focus on autocall theory itself encompassing the most common types and their forms of payment  trinomial tree model the trinomial tree was introduced for the first time by boyle  and explained in hull  and haug  it is seen as constituting an extension of the binomial approach from cox et al  and is conceptually similar according to the trinomial  pvj da gama silva et al method the underlying stock is modelled as a recombination tree where the price has three possible paths at each node upwards downwards or stable for standard type options where the number of steps increases results converge rapidly and the binomial model is then preferred due to its simple implementation however in the case of exotic options the trinomial model or adaptations shows more stable and precise results independently of the size of the step according to the trinomial method the price of the underlying stock is modelled as a recombination tree where the price has three possible paths at each node upwards downwards and a stable or middle one these values are found by multiplying the value at the current node by the appropriate factor where tueσ××δ  tde uσ−× ×δ  m  u  price x’ s multiplicative additive increase factor d  price x’s multiplicative additive decrease factor m  price x’s multiplicative stability factor figure  illustrates the dynamics of stock prices in the trinomial tree using n   steps for the time figure  demonstration of the trinomial model source rouah andvainberg  autocall structured products  in order to contain all possible price movements in a trinomial tree with n steps one needs a matrix with n   lines and n  columns corresponding to a size  ×  matrix the increase decrease and stability probabilities are represented in this order by the following formulas ttrqtteepueeσσσδδ−×−×δδ×−×⎛⎞−⎜⎟⎜⎟−⎝⎠  ttrqtteepdeeσσσδδ×−×δδ×−×⎛⎞−⎜⎟⎜⎟−⎝⎠  pm pu pd−   where δ t is the period of time ơ is the volatility adopted r is the rate of interest paid q represents dividend payments which in this case would is zero and pu and pd are unconditionally positive the modification of the tree for the pricing of structured products with complex variables is introduced for the first time in this study and will be detailed later in the methodology as a model which seeks to simply the calculation by adopting a processing dynamic that is low in terms of computational capacity it should be noted that this model was chosen because according to anderson et al  it is clear that implicit methods require additional computation skills and their implementation can be much more difficult implicit methods are used in problems where the use of an explicit method would require impracticably small steps to ensure limited errors to attain the precision sought after in such problems much less computational time is necessary than when using an implicit method they are usually unconditionally stable and it is thus possible to use greater values in the steps so that a solution may be found more quickly however the computational cost also increases considerably which in turn increases the need for extensive database processing a modelling that is similar to the trinomial model can be found in the explicit finite difference method which will be described below  the finite difference model according to collatz  the finite difference model is a method for solving differential equations that is based on derivate approximation by finite differences the formulas for finite differences can be obtained by developing taylor series – see for example ames  roache  and lapidus and piner  the derived finite difference operator can be obtained from the taylor series for the function    xhxxhoh  ∫∫∫ thus the derivative can be written as a difference plus an error term  pvj da gama silva et al  xh xxohh−∫∫∫ ignoring the error term one obtains the finite difference operator for the first derivative f defined as  xhxdx h−∫∫∫  according to vista  regarding precision and order the error in the solution of a method is defined as the difference between its approximation and the exact analytical solution the two sources of error in finite difference methods are the rounding error which is the loss of precision due to computational rounding of decimal amounts – which can also occur in the trinomial model jeopardising the results of very sensitive models and the truncation error which is the residual that results when the exact solution of the dependent variable in the discretised equation of the mathematical model is substituted in order to use a finite difference method to try to solve or usually obtain an approximate solution of a problem one should first discretise the domination problem this is usually performed by dividing the domination into a uniform grid as can be seen in figure  figure  discretisation of a function on a grid see online version for colours source kaw and kalu  note that this means that finite difference methods produce discrete sets of numerical approximations for the derivative temporally in steps the most common examples of this method are expressed in the form of ordinary differential equations and in the heat equation in the approach of the model used by deng et al  for the pricing of autocall products the authors use an explicit calculation of finite differences and partial differential equations pde with the blackscholes formula as presented by zvan et al  which discusses the pde methodology for the pricing of barrier options it is also worth mentioning that the monte carlo model is another option of numerical method for the valuation of structured products autocall structured products   autocall according to fries and joshi  and georgieva  the use of autocall structure products has become common in recent years also because they act similarly to a rational investor who has a broad view of the underlying asset according to deng et al  the fact that most structured products were of longer term around five years or more was regarded as a negative factor by many investors throughout the world an interesting way of enhancing the reduction of an investment’s duration was discovered with the use of autocall products which according to alexander and sheedy  essentially function like a european barrier option in which if at a predetermined future date the market is above a defined trigger level the structure will be automatically revoked with investors receiving their principal along with a specified return the eightyear period since the first autocall product was produced in  has seen a series of innovations that have refined the original model which according to citifirst  are • performance autocall in which the autocall coupon is not fixed at a specific level but pays the greater of x and the actual underlying performance in the case of an autocall event • crescendo autocall in which the autocall event depends on two underlyings being above the autocall barrier and besides this there is an additional condition in which the second underlying provides additional financing for higher autocall coupons • escalator autocall in which the autocall barrier decreases each year – increasing the likelihood of an autocall event and reducing the probability of capital at risk • bonus plus autocall in which besides the autocall coupon received at automatic maturity investors receive a bonus coupon in this case the earlier in the life of the product autocall occurs the better so that the effective per annum coupon is high in early years compared with a standard autocall note thus reducing the value of coupon payments towards maturity • premium express in which the autocall barrier is below  of the initial strike level aiming to provide a high autocall probability with full capital protection bouzoubaa and osseiran  perform a descriptive analysis of the main autocall structures considering payments performance and the dispersion effect itself also considering hypothetical explanatory scenarios in order to better understand the analyses that follow below  unique assets subject to autocall  payments description considering a product with autocall based in one single asset s the

does not receive an additional payment if h is achieved on one of the observation dates so a product is considered to have been autocalled if its lifecycle is interrupted when barrier h is achieved by the underlying on a specific observation date the autocall structure itself does not have a fixed lifecycle until maturity maturity in fact is the maximum amount of time that a product manages to remain active the autocall trigger h is a predetermined level above which the autocall structure terminates and the investor receives the invst invested trigger i can be fixed during the life of the product or may vary in some cases the trigger may also increase or decrease over time the coupon trigger b also known as the coupon level is a predetermined level above which the investor receives a periodic coupon in other words if the underlying observation level is greater than the coupon trigger a coupon based on the invst is paid to the investor the autocall and coupon triggers of some structures involving autocall are equal and are known as autocall products with knockout coupons however when the coupon is paid the product is autocalled at the same time provided the autocall trigger has been attained thus this structure pays a single coupon on an observation date during the whole life of the product in cases in which the coupon level is different from the autocall trigger the products are known as autocall products with knockin coupons  payment mechanisms this section explains the various payment mechanisms through the simulation of scenarios shown in tables  and  accompanied by figures  and  with a specific case to better understand the autocall structure consider a retail investor in an investment bank who invests us  in an autocall structured product based

source bouzoubaa and osseiran  p in the scenario presented in figure  the product holder receives annual coupons based on the performance of the worst shares at the end of the first year all the performances of the share are above  but the worstperforming share kbc is above  thus the first coupon is equal to  of invst and the structure is not autocalled as there is at least one share under  which is the autocall trigger which produces a second coupon of  at maturity one of the shares has a performance of less than  fortis therefore there is no coupon at the end of the third year and the investor receives  of invst on this last observation date autocall structured products  figure  return scenarios for underlying shares based on the worst performance of autocalls source bouzoubaa and osseiran  p  the snowball effect and performance based on the worst of autocalls with put options tools when the autocall and coupon triggers are the same the product terminates immediately after the payment of the coupon in other words only one coupon is paid however coupon payments can be modified creating the socalled ‘snowball coupons’ if the product remains active until year i this means that the investor has not received the periodic coupons the ‘snowball’ structure allows the investor to receive a coupon equal to the sum of all previous coupons if the trigger is achieved the performance based on the worst autocall can also be used as a downandin put option tool in the autocall structure this occurs when an investor is willing to increase the potential coupon receipt and believes that the products that comprise the basket will act above a specific level this means that the principal is no longer protected as the investor is in a short position in relation to a put option at the product’s redemption as in the case of autocall products for a single asset the put option can be a european option underlying the basket of assets with the same expiry date as the final redemption

principal if the price on the autocall date is equal to or greater than the autocall price forced redemption occurs and investors receive their principal plus the respective month’s interest due terminating the investment if the product does not reach the autocall barrier and if it is above the coupon barrier and the knockin level on the autocall date interest is paid when the price is below the autocall level and the coupon barrier and knockin levels the investor continues remaining invested but does not receive the respective month’s interest if the product is not autocalled during its life cycle and reaches the scheduled maturity date there are three possible scenarios to consider in the first the price is above the autocall barrier coupon barrier and knockin level prices in this case investors receive the principal plus this last month’s interest in the second the price is below the autocall level but above the coupon barrier and knockin level in this case interest is paid although the underlying’s return is negative in the third case in which the price is below the autocall level the coupon barrier and the knockin level in this worst case autocall structured products  scenario the investor is exposed fully to the downside as the company is has bought a put option  database and methodology this chapter was divided into two sections the first part describes the database used in the treatment of information and the second part presents the methodology used for the calculations that formed the basis for this study’s results  database the database was obtained from two distinct sources bloomberg according to the data entry parameters described by citigroup funding inc in the issue contract of this vale sa structured product and economática the entry data in the model are composed of the start price of us  obtained from bloomberg on  which automatically generated other data such as the autocall us  knockin and the coupon barrier us  the coupon paid stipulated by contract is  per year which can generate monthly payments of  if the product’s price is at conditional levels that provide for this payment as explained above the main volatility ơ of the model is  considering historical volatility – obtained from the price database of economàtica and varies between  and  for experimental modelling in order to note the pricing discrepancies due to it – which is the only conditional variable that can be manipulated to influence this product’s pricing  methodology the analysis covers the month period from the start price established for vale sa vale stock on  so that this product’s data inputs coupon barrier knockin and autocall begin at this start price the modifications in the trinomial tree include the coupon barrier knockin and autocall conditions as well as the dynamics of the calculation of the note’s present value taking these conditions into consideration i should be mentioned that the trinomial tree model proposed is exactly that one of hull  changes were only incorporated in the present value calculation and in the inclusion of the conditional coupon barrier knockin and autocall the coupon payments based on the capital invested are brought to present value according to the price’s position in the tree that is its position at the node thus one can note that the conditions should be analysed on an individual basis for each tree node it should also be noted that the underlying asset assumes a geometric brownian motion in order to achieve a better understanding an illustrative model is generated in figure  considering that the product has a maximum life of three months  pvj da gama silva et al figure  demonstration of the calculation of the modified trinomial model this example considered an initial price p of us  autocall level of us  and coupon barrier and knockin level of us  and used a volatility of  or  the underlined values show the coupon payments due according to the vale sa product’s conditions and the values in boldtype refer to the present value of the coupon paid thus the value in boldtype noted below the initial price is the product’s final present value which is the sum of the all other values in boldtype during the first period it can be observed that the price of   exceeds the autocall barrier and the price of   attains it and thus they are redeemed and the principal plus interest        are rescued so that the subsequent calculation for this ‘node’ is no longer needed since the product finished in this part of the tree the present value is then generated as follows autocall structured products   rpv principal cumulative probability for each nodenexp ln r t⎡⎤××⎢⎥⎣⎦⎡⎤×−×⎣⎦ where r  the coupon amount paid for the product n  the relevant observation period t  the total period applying equation  the amount paid of    the probability of rising   exp –ln       as stated above present values are obtained according to the position of the node that is taking as an example the value of us  in the second period the payment is       because the barrier of autocall was not reached only the interest payments and thus the calculation of the pv value for this kind of situation will change to  rpv principal cumulative probability for each nodenexp ln r t⎡⎤××⎢⎥⎣⎦⎡⎤×−×⎣⎦  applying equation  the amount paid of    the probability of falling   the probability of

of the product would continue to be done period three in this illustrative example has the same conditional as period  thus it is clear that if the price closes above the barrier during the last period the investor obtains the principal plus interest and if it closes below the coupon barrier vale sa is in fact buying a put option and the buyer is short – the calculation is  tprincipalclosing below the coupon barrier pp⎛⎞×⎜⎟⎝⎠  appling the equation         in order to automate the calculation process a calculation methodology was developed that seeks to exploit the product’s conditionals with the matrix idea for the work with the database using the computer language vba in excel the vale sa prices used to calculate historical volatility were obtained on a daily basis during the  months prior to the issue of the note from the economatica database they were adjusted for dividends but not for inflation a value of  or  was found historical volatility according to da silva  corresponds to the standard deviation of the natural logarithms of the between consecutive periods it iscalculated as follows  pvj da gama silva et al  calculatel n pi  pi– for each period where pi is the closing price of period i and pi– is the same closing price of the previous period  calculate the standard deviation of the values calculated in item  for the n periods that precede the period considered n is a parameter of the indicator  annualise the volatility obtained in item  for example if the values of item  are on a daily basis multiply the standard deviation of item  by the square root of  where   the approximate number of business days in a year some pricing scenarios will be structured using volatility as the basis for the analysis of the product during this period  results through a structured analysis as can be seen in table  the research developed scenarios considering different maturities of  to  months for the vale sa product as well as a volatility that varied from

prices on the initial date may be observed in an environment of lower volatility of  which is quite rare in this type of industry but more likely in the power sector for example moreover the highest price of all the simulations – us  – occurs in this same volatility scenario from the seventh to the tenth period it is important to note that the increase in volatility leads to a significant decline in prices with the lowest – us  – found in the scenario of  volatility during the first period during the first period it can be observed that there is a greater degree of ‘indifference’ in pricing due to the variation of volatility in the cases of volatilities of  to  prices remain constant at us  the margin of price variation considering their deviation by period is greater at the first redemption than at the others with the lowest being during the last period as prices are then declining it can also be observed that with very low volatility of say  and high volatility of  to  the price of the longer maturity note is greater than one with a shorter duration the contrary occurs when volatility is between  and  therefore the ideal for autocall structured products is precisely a short maturity with redemption occurring during the first months of the product’s life in an environment of moderate volatility so that an investor can seek similar products and obtain a profit  pvj da gama silva et al figure  shows the actual behaviour of the coupon barrier note issued by vale sa figure  real product pricing considering the validation dates and realised periods source own calculus observing the product’s actual behaviour it can be seen that investors incurred losses in as much as the product completed its lifecycle had coupon nonpayment dates and on the final date the price was below the barrier and the knockin level – which led to a greater exposure on the part of investors who faced a loss of  at the end as regards the pricing of the product in as much as price volatility during the period attained  considering daily prices in dollars from  to  as well as dividends in the scenarios cited in table  the product has a present value of us   conclusions this study sought to describe various features of the autocall structure in complex products which involve differentiated methodologies due to various details of calculation as mentioned above in the typology of this product in an appropriate pricing model as seen above volatility due to autocall influences the pricing of these products in a very peculiar fashion – which according to the interval analysed for the total life of the product  months varies between us  and us  thus one may note that volatility acts as the main measure of dispersion of the product’s returns it was observed in this study that the use of a reliable model to price autocall products that is concerned with being agile enough to process large databases in order to maintain the data accuracy necessary to ensure the adequate functioning of these structured products enables investors to assess whether the product’s return according to its historic volatility is over or underestimated therefore based on the information collected or scenarios developed investors will be able to undertake their operations which may be hedging arbitrage or speculative autocall structured products  operations – depending on the type of product thus it is necessary to calibrate models to the reality of the market in which they will be used and to product typology references alexander c and sheedy e  the professional risk

tree model with autocall barrier and knockin conditions and which was modified to calculate present value this model was shown to be practical and agile for processing the database and handling considerably volatile scenarios and was also validated by the product’s actual behaviour revealing that the product was not financially attractive for maintaining an autocall operation strategy
