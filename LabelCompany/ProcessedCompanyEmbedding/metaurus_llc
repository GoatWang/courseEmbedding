battle for the entire war how can that be hannibal was not even there but his brother was there in command of an army sent to reinforce hannibal and give him the strength and stamina to finish off the romans by this time 7 bce the romans were mostly avoiding headtohead battles with hannibal and he mostly lacked the cavalry strength to force them to fight where he wanted them to when the romans intercepted messengers hasdrubal sent to alert hannibal to his arrival they realized how critical it was to keep the brothers from joining together and rushed an overwhelming force to surprise and destroy the new army and won now see if you can change or maintain the history the romans have numbers and overall troop quality on their side hasdrubal has a wide range of troops from crack heavy infantry and light cavalry from africa to poor quality celtic levies and they have the superior position the game calls on both players to do better than their historical counterparts richard bergs
