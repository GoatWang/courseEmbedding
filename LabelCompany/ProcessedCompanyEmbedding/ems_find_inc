promoted  million company could drop   ems find inc otcmktsintv  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»ems find inc why this promoted  million company could drop jun  about ems find intv penny stock realist short onlypenny stock realistsummarythere is a stock promotional landing page out there httpemsfreportcom free trading shares that could be dumped into the stock promotionmoskowitz mailer promotions typically perform terriblyems find otcemsf is a name that i believe is currently the target of a penny stock promotion scheme it is my view that the stocks intrinsic value is somewhere near  and it is with conviction that i recommend that any investors currently in the name sell the entirety of their stakes immediately i also believe that ems find is a stock definitely worth shorting my track record of identifying and publicly exposing such highly overvalued equities is excellent little revenue debts no business bright future as is usually the case with these types of hypedup scams it takes only one quick glance at the balance sheet to realize that the m market capitalization that this equity commands is beyond ludicrous with  in current assets and  in current liabilities its my suspicion that the purpose of this company is not to succeed but to sell stock the recent volume is due to overly bullish promotional mailers picture of emsf chart you can see that trading in ems find started seeing really increased volume on june   you can see it was around the this time the landing page went up coincidence with the time of the landing page and increased volume in ems find absolutely not online landing page disclaimer landing page details go here to see details about the landing page tabius sway media inc has paid one million and two hundred thousand dollars for the dissemination of this information to enhance public awareness of emsf you can see obviously someone is interested in increasing public awareness for ems find most likely the insiders who own  free trading shares in ems find why else would someone spend  to increase public awareness at these levels those are worth about  million it is worth it to them because if they can bring in buyers and liquidate their shares around these prices that can mean millions in profits running pump and dump schemes is a lucrative business and that is why we see it way too often my job is to wake you up promoter history the promoter behind ems find is the moskowitz report how will the ems find story play out it will act like the rest of their promotions people who buy ems find will lose and the insiders will laugh all the way to the bank interested in some of their past promotions below are some of their promotions you can tell when the promotion starts by seeing when the stocks start trading large volume falconridge oil technologies virtus oil and gas corp my recommendation if you own shares of this company get out now do not hope that you can hang on to sell them to a greater fool these shares are worthless i have showed you that the reason for the promotional email campaign indicates that the individuals behind this stock scam are trying desperately to unload their worthless shares onto the unsuspecting public and book a huge profit before the inevitable collapse if you are a more sophisticated investor and can get a borrow on these shares then i believe that shorting this name will be highly lucrative for you this will end horribly just like all stock promotions of this kind you have been warned disclosure the author is short emsf the author wrote this

otcmktsemsf soar after launching new rideshare program by michael luke  march    share on facebook tweet on twitter ems find inc otcmktsemsf shares were up over  recently and this may have been due to the announcement of its beta launch of rideshare if you haven’t heard of ems find inc yet it’s a wholly owned subsidiary of the paradigm group inc ems find is an applications and software development company primarily engaged in the healthcare transportation industry   ems find app is an innovative product and it’s the first of its kind in the industry this app is an ondemand platform that connects consumers to healthcare providers with the closest medical transportation providers consequently this would benefit patients using this service and it would enable the user base which includes hospitals nursing homes medical offices  home care agencies and other medical providers and public to schedule transportation in an efficient matter based on the type of medical transportation that best fits every patient’s needs   getting back to the news that may have been the catalyst that caused ems find inc otcmktsemsf shares to double ems find inc announced the beta launch of rideshare which is a transportation portal powered by uber central rideshare is focused on providing a convenient and reliable transportation service to patients and seniors   with the aging population there are an increasing amount of seniors that would like to remain in their homes with their families rather than moving to assisted living homes and facilities however transportation may be challenging and many seniors have either delayed or even missed their medical appointments due to the poor supply of appropriate transportation services     according to ems find inc ceo steve rubakh “transportation is critical for all seniors especially those who have mobility challenges to stay in their homes as they age without being stuck at home because of a lack of transportation options…rideshare service in collaboration with uber central makes it easier for seniors and caregivers to set up transportation while providing elderly with help they need to remain independent and be able to afford to get where they need to go”   now a free call to rideshare allows seniors to set their rides in order to get to their doctor appointments to go shopping run errands or visit friends and family moving on the rideshare portal allows users to track and schedule rides anywhere in the us where uber operates   in addition to this news ems find inc announced that it changed its business strategy in order to drive longterm shareholder value growth that in mind these moves could potentially further propel the stock higher   ems find ceo stated “we plan to focus on providing smaller middle market private companies with a strategy that includes an equity capitalization an equity exit and a liquidity this change in business strategy is intended to provide our shareholders and investors with access to unique business opportunities with the potential for significant upside while reducing risk through diversification our shortterm goal is to deliver our first ma transaction to our shareholders by the end of the month”   that in mind ems find inc plans to follow a business structure similar to that of berkshire hathaway the ma structure would enable private businesses in order to take advantage of the power of a public company without losing autonomous management control   ems find inc just spiked up recently and it could be due to these two catalysts
