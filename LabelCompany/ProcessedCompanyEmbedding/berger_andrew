mit phd  at the latter dr berger did his doctoral work in the gr harrison spectroscopy laboratory under michael feld developing methods of blood analysis using laser spectroscopy prior to coming to the institute of optics he spent two years at the beckman laser institute and medical center in irvine ca building handheld systems to analyze breast tissue content thanks to a postdoctoral fellowship from the george e hewitt foundation for medical research unlike his advisor bruce tromberg however andrew escaped southern california research overviewprofessor bergers area of interest is biomedical optics specifically spectroscopic diagnostic techniques with recent advances in optical technology it is now possible to perform sensitive chemical tests on samples and live subjects using light rather than reagents or electrodes the groups present research is centered upon raman spectroscopy of oral bacteria singlecell raman spectroscopy multimodal microscopy raman plus elastic scatter nearinfrared spectroscopy of hemodynamics in the human brain more generally professor berger seeks to apply lasers and spectroscopic methods absorption fluorescence raman and scattering spectroscopies to problems of medical interest as offshoots of this basic thrust other interests include  exploring fundamental aspects of light scattering and diffusion in turbid eg biological media and  developing novel spectroscopic techniques through both instrumentation and analytical modeling that extend the range of biomedical phenomena which can be studied using lightthe proximity of the institute of optics to the medical center offers opportunities for close interaction with clinical collaborators and patients professor berger also holds a secondary appointment in the department of biomedical
