september   the  billion hicks muse tate  furst inc equity fund iii a leveraged buyout fund popular with institutional investors was blasted by calpers staffnewly released documents reveal staff at the california public employees retirement system sacramento believe hicks muse overpaid for radio stations and has little alignment of fees with performancethey said executives at dallasbased hicks muse have limited investment experience in one key potential investment area latin america and no experience with a fund as large as fund iii related coverage connecticut increases fee transparency in b plans states take varied routes to solving pension woes japans gpif emphasis on low fees giving way to search for alignment related connecticut increases fee transparency in b plans but other pension fund investors in equity fund iii dismissed calpers criticism as almost incomprehensible bitternessseveral of them described it as a case of sour grapesin recently released transcripts of a closeddoor discussion earlier this year barry gonder calpers senior investment officer for alternative investments said he was concerned about hicks muse buying into radio stations when multiples for radio stations are at an alltime high i think it would be a better strategy to be exiting radio stationsmr gonder also expressed concern about organizational issues such as how much time hicks muse executives will be dedicated to the fund vs other activities by the general partneranother issue was feeshicks muse could lose all the money in equity fund iii and they would still make  million to  million in profit per year over a year period that is a lot of money said mr gonderthe way the hicks muse fund is currently structured said sheryl pressler chief investment officer the general partners make a profit whether or not calpers doesin response dan h banks a senior vice president with hicks muse said we have to perform well enough that we repay the fee before we get anythingif we just do well enough to generate returns that equal the management fee of  a year we would have to repay that and we end up getting nothing said mr bankscalpers staff also raised these concerns the funds expected internal rate of return was not as high as other partnerships already in the calpers portfolio the fund employs a higher risk strategy than comparable partnerships because it paid relatively higher prices for its acquisitions and exercised lower levels of direct control over operationshicks muse does not have a long track record in foreign investments though  of the funds assets could be invested in latin america equity fund iii is almost triple the amount hicks muse has invested in the pastthe transcript also showed hamilton lane advisors philadelphia one of calpers

investment services inc which oversees american airlines pension fund investments dismissed criticism of the fund as being bad information and described equity fund iii as an excellent investmenthicks muse may not buy at the cheapest price but they buy at a fair price and then they build businesses around that and the synergy of those businesses add value and good returns he saidmr quinn said the partners have had substantial success in latin americaon fees he said general partners receiving fees regardless of the profit of a partnership is true of any similar partnershipit the calpers criticism sounds like sour grapes he saidofficials at both the colorado and oregon funds said they have been happy with hicks muses performancetom hicks chairman of hicks muse tate  furst inc said the calpers staff criticism was unfortunate and results from an agenda that i dont understandwe have most of the prestigious investment groups and pension funds in the country said mr hickshe said compound annual return for hicks muses equity fund i was about  fund ii will be over  and fund iii he believes will be over we operate in a highpriced environment very successfully because we have been among the most successful in the country to use operating strategy where we buy a core business and use it to buy other companies as a way of lowering our prices at effective multiples said mr hicksfund ii he said had a cost basis of  per share and is worth  per share today investments in fund iii already have doubled in the last yearmr hicks also said the partnership has invested in latin
