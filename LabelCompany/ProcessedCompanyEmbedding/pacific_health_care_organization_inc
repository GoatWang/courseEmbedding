video subsidiaries phco financials archive news room contact   phco through our whollyowned subsidiaries we provide a range of workers’ compensation solutions to employers in california  these services include managing and administering health care organizations and medical provider networks implementing and administering workers’ compensation carveouts utilization review medical bill review and nurse case management  we are also preparing to offer lien representation services     our subsidiaries   through our two hco licenses we offer injured workers a choice of enrolling in an hco with a network managed by primary care providers requiring a referral to specialists or a second hco where injured workers do not need any prior authorization to be seen and treated by specialists the two hco certifications obtained by medex cover the entire state of california   medical and indemnity costs associated with workers’ compensation in the state california are billions of dollars annually  our two hco certified programs have contracted with over  individual providers and clinics as well as hospitals pharmacies rehabilitation centers and other ancillary services making our hcos capable of providing comprehensive medical services throughout this region  we are continually developing these networks based upon the nominations of new clients and the approvals of their claims’ administrators  provider credentialing is performed by medex as discussed above under the hco guidelines all hcos are required to pay certain fees  these requirements increase the administrative costs of an hco although as a result of the restructuring of the hco enrollment fee such differences are no longer substantial due to multiple hco requirements many clients opt to use the less complicated mpn even though the client has less control over the employee’s claim  the hco program gives the client in most cases  days of medical control in a provider network within which the client has the ability to direct the claim the injured worker may change physicians once but may not leave the network  whereas the mpn program seems to allow medical control for the life of the claim but contains provisions that allow the employer client’s control of only the initial treatment before the employee can treat with anyone in the network  in addition the mpn statute and regulations allow the injured worker to dispute treatment decisions leading to second and third opinions and then a review by an independent medical reviewer whose decision can end up with the employer client losing medical control  a significant number of employer clients have availed themselves of the mpn  others utilize the provisions of the hco plus mpn program unlike hcos mpns are not assessed annual fees and no annual enrollment notice delivery requirements  mpn’s are only required to provide an enrollment notice at the time the employee first joins the mpn and a second notice must be delivered to the employee at the time he suffers a workplace injury  as a result there are fewer administrative costs associated with administering an mpn program which allows mpns to market their services at a lower cost fees than hcos   in march  we incorporated medex managed care inc in the state of nevada as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  in april  mmc took over the responsibilities of overseeing and managing the utilization review and medical bill review business previously managed by medex utilization review utilization review includes   utilization review or utilization management functions that prospectively retrospectively or concurrently review and approve modify delay or deny based in whole or in part on medical necessity to cure and relieve treatment recommendations by physicians prior to retrospectively or concurrent with the provision of such medical treatment services pursuant to california workers’ compensation law or other jurisdictional statutes we provide ur to selfinsured clients insurance companies and public entities  ur helps to reduce costs for the payor and determine if the recommended treatment is appropriate  mmc offers automated review services that can cut the overhead costs of our client and increase payor savings  our ur staff is experienced in the workers’ compensation industry and dedicated to provide a high standard of customer service medical bill review medical bill review   “mbr”   refers to professional analysis of medical provider services or equipment billing to ascertain the proper reimbursement  such services include but are not limited to coding review and rebundling reasonable and customary review fee schedule analysis outofnetwork bill review pharmacy review ppo management and repricing in connection with our mbr services we provide bill review cost containment services to selfinsured employers insurance companies and the public sector to help reduce medical expenses paid by our customers  in providing these services we provide network savings on top of state fee schedule savings allowing top provider networks to achieve savings we offer our clients with quick turnaround state of the art software and the expertise of our bill review staff  we are committed to service and believe the reputation of our staff sets us apart from our competition   on february   we incorporated medex medical management inc “mmm” in the state of nevada as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  mmm will be responsible for overseeing and managing nurse case management “ncm” services previously managed by our subsidiary medex nurse case management nurse case management is a collaborative process that assesses plans implements coordinates monitors and evaluates the options and services required to meet an injured worker’s health needs  our nurse case managers use communication and available resources to promote quality costeffective outcomes with the goal of returning the injured worker to gainful employment and maximum medical improvement as soon as medically appropriate our credentialed registered nurses have expertise in various clinical areas and extensive backgrounds in workers’ compensation  this combination allows our nurses the opportunity to facilitate the medical treatment while understanding the nuances of workers’ compensation up to and including litigation  by providing these services we contribute to effective delivery of medical treatment assuring the injured worker receives quality treatment in a timely and appropriate manner to return the worker to gainful employment   in june  we acquired arissa managed care inc as a whollyowned subsidiary of the company to sell services offered by medex irc or any other subsidiary of the company in february  arissa changed its name to medex legal support inc and plans to offer to its customers all aspects of lien defense from negotiation to lien litigation including filing petitions for reconsideration mls plans to provide its clients a broad comprehensive lien representation program while settling liens resulting in high potential savings for its clients subsequently the previous owners of arissa were allowed to again utilize the arissa name in conducting their own business   in  we incorporated workers compensation assistance inc now known as industrial resolutions coalition inc as a whollyowned subsidiary with the intent of pursuing other opportunities in the workers’ compensation field  toward the end of  we identified a business opportunity within the workers’ compensation field that we have begun to pursue  through irc we seek to create legal agreements for the implementation of workers’ compensation carveouts for california employers with collective bargaining units and the administration of such programs within the statutory and regulatory requirements the california legislature permits employers and employees to engage in collective bargaining over alternative systems to resolve disputes in the workers’ compensation context   these systems are called carveouts because the employers and employees covered by such collective bargaining agreements are carved out from the state workers’ compensation system  the goals of a carveout include improving safety programs and having fewer injury and illness claims increasing access to quality medical providers and medical evaluators lowering costs of medical care reducing disputes improving collaboration between unions and employers increasing satisfaction of all parties and providing the opportunity for continuous improvement by renegotiating the terms of the carveout on an asneeded basis privacy policy  code of ethics  copyright   phco inc all rights reserved phco corporate site pacific health care organization inc pacific

of  shares  shares may not seem like a lot but the total outstanding shares are less than k and the float is around k according to otcmarketscom there is currently  left authorized in the buyback program at the current share price at the time of this writing of  would represent an about an additional  shares or  of the outstanding total or  of the float which seems rather sizable at least to me i also finding it interesting that right at the start of the quarter ceo tom kubota bought  shares in the open market at  all of this circumstantial evidence gives me more confidence in pfho with details mentioned in my last article entitled why pacific health cares q and outlook are even better than you think on a side note pfhos website now mentions something i found interesting on the about section it states our partnership with phco afforded us the opportunity to build decision ur software as its own brand in addition we were able to secure new blue chip customers which positioned the company at a new level coupled with expanding our competencies into the product lifecycle management area we have found the support of phco to have been very successful for the company dr lester sacks ceo of decisionur ltd decisionur software is a california company recently acquired by patriot national nysepn pn is a floridabased workers compensation company like pfho and seems to be on an acquisition binge since going public in january of this year it has announced the acquisition of nine companies in the last four months alone being public likely makes it cheaper and easier to make acquisitions especially when a company has a liquid public stock to back it up could pfho be next on the menu for pn ive long thought the only logical end game for pfho is to be acquired for a premium given how illiquid the stock often is at times its entirely speculative on my part but i have to wonder with pns subsidiary giving such high accolades to pfho if maybe pn would want to just acquire the entire company and make it acquisition number  it certainly could explain the desire of pfho to keep buying its own stock which likely would result in a higher buyout offer per remaining share
