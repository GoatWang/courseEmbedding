partners lp nysebpy  using covered calls to outperform the stock date published  preface while covered calls are one of the most commonly used option strategies it turns out we need to be clever in how we treat earnings in order to maximize the strategy in brookfield property partners lp nysebpy  even further if we dont do this analysis we can easily dismiss some worthy covered call opportunities as losers this is one of those cases story theres a lot less luck involved in successful option trading than many people realize and were going to review that right now for bpy lets first examine a twoyear backtest of a covered call strategy with some simple rules  trade monthly options roll the trade every days  avoid earnings  test this strategy for twoyears heres how this quick set up looks in the backtester if we do this test it turns out the best covered call to sell is out of the money with a delta of  any delta below  is usually out of the money and certainly a  delta is out of the money results if we do a covered call in brookfield property partners lp nysebpy over the last twoyears but always skip earnings we get these results buy bpy stock sell  delta call  trade frequency  days  always avoid earnings gross gain  gross loss  covered call return    stock return  outperformance    that tile tells us two critical pieces of information first we see a very nice covered call result with a  return but just as important we also see that the  return in the covered call considerably outperforms brookfield property partners lp stock over the last twoyears which hit  in total were looking at a  outperformance while taking less risk than owning the stock outright and always avoiding earnings risk going further while outperforming the stock and avoiding the risk of earnings is a powerful implementation of a covered call we actually did even better next we do the same backtest but this time we only trade earnings that is we open our position twodays before earnings let the event occur and close the position twodays after earnings heres the setup  very easy just click the appropriate buttons now we examine the results for that same  delta covered call buy bpy stock sell  delta call  trade frequency  days  only trade earnings gross gain  gross loss  covered call return    now we see why avoiding earnings was so powerful holding the covered call in brookfield property partners lp nysebpy through earnings underperformed the stock and certainly underperformed a covered call that avoided this risk in fact our strategy to avoid earnings beat the strategy held only during earnings by a whopping  it could have been so easy to miss this result without diving just a little deeper than the standard option analysis clarity for some clarity we simply chart the returns of the stock the covered call strategy with earnings and the one that avoids earnings below brookfield property partners lp stockand covered call returns  note the outperformance we get in brookfield property partners lp by being methodical in our approach and in this case avoiding the risk of earnings trading truths going through this practice with brookfield
