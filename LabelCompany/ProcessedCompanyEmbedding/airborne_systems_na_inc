solr™ oxygen mask overview specificationsspec sheetsrelated products overview the solr™ oxygen mask builds on the reliability and strong features of its predecessor the airborne systems’ phaos oxygen mask the current reference for the parachutist oxygen masks used by military units worldwide the solr™ oxygen mask is compatible with the new solr™ and legacy phaos bailout bottles it is also compatible with the phantom bailout bottle the solr™ oxygen mask provides the same performance and time proven reliability as the phaos oxygen mask with the added benefit of new features developed based on input received from experiences collected over the years from the military free fall community the solr™ oxygen mask features a new nondilution oxygen demand regulator which delivers  oxygen during inhalation both during prebreathing and during the actual jump and descent under canopy  this ensures that the jumper is never breathing a mix of gas and mitigates the risk of hypoxia drastically increasing the safety of operation  this breakthrough innovation is made possible thanks to the very high service pressure of airborne systems’ latest bailout bottles allowing them to contain significantly more oxygen than traditional bailout bottles key features lightweight on demand regulator no dilution  o modular dilution module optional compatible with solr  phaos  phantom

deployed the system need not be recovered the reduction in initial cost and the lifecycle resource savings provide added operational flexibility gpads capability supports operational payload between  –  lbs  –  kg lightweight  lbs  kg max release altitude of  ft  m kt canopy precision airdrops made simple flyclops k® can glide up to  kilometers after being dropped and will land within  meters of a designated impact point ip this horizontal and vertical separation between the delivery aircraft and the unit receiving supplies increases safety for the air crew and improves security for the receiving unit the ability to autonomously deliver supplies reduces the need for vehicular traffic reducing the logistical footprint and the number of convoys required to sustain a deployed force reduce cost improve flexibility the kt parachute delivers the same high performance and capability as the k firefly® parachute but is designed to enable the soldier to cut the payload and guidance system free leaving the parachute behind using the lower cost kt parachute reduces the equipment cost of providing aerial supplies using gpads should operational constraints dictate that the conventional firefly® parachute cannot be recovered at the time this option provides greater operational flexibility to commanders in the field ease of use the flyclops k® is delivered packed and ready for deployment and requires only simple rigging to the payload cargo delivery parachute mission planning the flyclops k® is compatible with the jtrax mission planner and the us air force
