bonesteel by matt bonesteel june  follow mattbonesteel did stephen a smith cross the line with his lamar odom comments gregory payanassociated press espn’s stephen a smith had some things to get off his chest on wednesday as he usually does about phil jackson’s quixotic stewardship of the new york knicks one of the examples smith eversosubtly brought up was the fact that jackson in one of his first transactions as knicks president in  signed lamar odom to a contract despite his issues with drug abuse odom never actually played in a game for new york im dying lmaooooo stephen a aint holding back pictwittercomkxvnqjvld — ela dubsdynasty june   not everyone was “lmaooooo” however odom’s attorney sent a letter to espn taking issue with smith’s exclamation about odom being on crack saying it was an insensitive thing to say about someone who is battling a disease like drug addiction odom tweeted out the letter on friday evening using slander as the hashtag slander ihopewearebetterthanthis pictwittercomrcgmpftkr — lamar odom reallamarodom june   smith then issued his own response saying he was trying to illustrate a point about jackson’s ineptitude and not odom’s struggles with drug abuse deadspin got a copy because of my personal affection for lamar odom — and only for that reason — i want to return to my comments about something i’ve repeated quite often over the last few days the flagrant ineptitude that i feel has been on continual display by knicks president phil jackson my comments were not to put any more focus on lamar odom’s much publicized drug use and addiction he was not the target of my ire the sole focus of my comments were directed at the unmitigated disaster that phil jackson has created since he’s arrived in new york it my opinion he simply couldn’t leave soon enough lamar odom is simply one of the nicest athletes any of us have encountered and has always been a gentlemen to everyone in nba circles — including me — which is something i’ve repeated throughout the years that’s why it’s worth repeating lamar odom was not the focus of my ire my comments were entirely totally meant for phil jackson anyone who loves the ny knicks who’ve witnessed what has been transpiring over the last three years know exactly who i was directing my comments to and why odom’s life spiraled out of control after his season nba career ended in  in october  he was found unconscious at a nevada brothel and had to be placed on life support at a las vegas hospital he suffered several strokes and damaged his kidneys after combining herbal sexual stimulants cocaine and alcohol reached for comment espn pointed to smith’s response and said it would not be commenting further at this time sports earlylead get the top olympics news by email major news and analysis
