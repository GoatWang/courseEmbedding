loan trust  pool information as of may        exhibit    the trust student loan pool   the trust student loans owned by the trust were originally selected from a portfolio of consolidation student loans owned by the student loan marketing association by employing several criteria including requirements that each trust student loan as of the original cutoff date     ·   was guaranteed as to principal and interest by a guaranty agency under a guarantee agreement and the guaranty agency was in turn reinsured by the department of education in accordance with the ffelp     ·   contained terms in accordance with those required by the ffelp the guarantee agreements and other applicable requirements     ·   was more than  days past the final disbursement     ·   was not more than  days past due     ·   did not have a borrower who was noted in the related records of the servicer as being currently involved in a bankruptcy proceeding and     ·   had special allowance payments if any based on the threemonth commercial paper rate or the day treasury bill rate   no trust student loan as of the original cutoff date was subject to the depositor’s or the student loan marketing association’s prior obligation to sell that loan to a third party the student loan marketing association was dissolved on december   and all of its obligations were assumed by its affiliate slm education credit finance corporation   unless otherwise specified all information with respect to the trust student loans is presented as of may   which is the statistical disclosure date   the distribution by weighted average interest rate applicable to the trust student loans on any date following the statistical disclosure date may vary significantly from that in the following tables as a result of variations in the effective rates of interest applicable to the trust student loans and in rates of principal reduction moreover the information below about the weighted average remaining term to maturity of the trust student loans as of the statistical disclosure date may vary significantly from the actual term to maturity of any of the trust student loans as a result of prepayments or the granting of deferment and forbearance periods   the following tables provide a description of specified characteristics of the trust student loans as of the statistical disclosure date the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the loans in each of the following tables includes the principal balance due from borrowers plus accrued interest of  to be capitalized as of the statistical

number of borrowers in the portfolio of   a     trust student loans for ease of administration the servicer separates a consolidation loan on its system into two separate loan segments representing subsidized and unsubsidized segments of the same loan the following tables reflect those loan segments within the number of loans in addition approximately  borrowers have more than one trust student

applicable trust student loan without giving effect to any deferment or forbearance periods that may be granted in the future see appendix a to the preliminary remarketing memorandum   the weighted average annual borrower interest rate shown in the table is exclusive of special allowance payments the weighted average spread for special allowance payments to the day treasury bill rate was  as of the statistical disclosure date   the weighted average spread for special allowance payments to the threemonth commercial paper rate was  as of the statistical disclosure date see “special allowance payments” in appendix a to the preliminary remarketing memorandum   for this purpose the threemonth commercial paper rate is the average of the bond equivalent rates of the threemonth commercial paper financial rates in effect for each of the days in a calendar quarter as reported by the federal reserve in publication h or its successor for that calendar quarter the day treasury bill rate is the weighted average per annum discount rate expressed on a bond equivalent basis and applied on a daily basis for direct obligations of the united states with a maturity of thirteen weeks as reported by the us department of the treasury   a     the category “treasury bill—other” in the table above represents the health education assistance loan program which we refer to as “heal” and the loans originated under such program as “heal loans” portion of any consolidation loans made under the ffelp which consolidated one or more stafford loans sls loans andor plus loans with one or more student loans originated under the heal program these consolidation loans are guaranteed as to principal and interest by a guaranty agency and reinsured by the department of education the heal portion of any consolidation loan is not eligible to receive special allowance payments or interest subsidy payments the interest rate on the heal loan segment of any such consolidation loan is variable and is reset each july  based upon the average bondequivalent rate for day treasury bills auctioned during the three months ending june  plus  in addition the applicable interest rate on the heal loan segment of

and covered bonds dated september   fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness the definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest are those held in the collection account and the funds can only be invested for a short duration given the payment frequency of the notes fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned rating sensitivities aaasf rated tranches of most ffelp securitizations will likely move in tandem with the us sovereign rating given the strong linkage to the us sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and sap provided by ed sovereign risks are not addressed in fitchs sensitivity analysis fitch conducted a ce sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions in addition fitch conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different assumptions for the ibr usage and prepayment rate the results below should only be considered as one potential model implied
