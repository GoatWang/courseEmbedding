provides a full range of energy management services for many of nrg energys generation facilities these services are provided under bilateral contracts or agency agreements pursuant to which nrg power marketing manages the sales and purchases of energy capacity and ancillary services procures the fuel coal and natural gas and associated transportation and manages the emission allowance credits for these facilities nrg power marketing has continued to provide these services since nrg energy lost its investment grade ratings in july  and because of nrg energys credit and liquidity limitations nrg power marketing has scaled back its activities since july  nrg power marketing has focused primarily on procuring fuel for and marketing the power from nrg energys north american generation facilities in the spot and shortterm markets regulation   environmental and safety laws and regulations       nrg south central is subject to a broad range of federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations applicable to the development ownership and operation of its projects these laws and regulations impose requirements relating to discharges of substances to the air water and land the handling storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of properties affected by pollutants these laws and regulations generally require that nrg south central obtain a number of governmental permits and approvals before construction or operation of a power plant commences and after completion that its facilities operate in compliance with those permits and applicable legal requirements nrg south central could also be held responsible under these laws for the cleanup of pollutants released at its facilities or at offsite locations where it has sent wastes       nrg south central strives at all times to comply with the terms of all environmental and safety laws regulations permits and licenses and nrg south central believes that all of its operating plants are in material compliance with applicable environmental and safety requirements nrg south central also does not expect that its liability under environmental laws for the cleanup of contamination at its plants or offsite waste disposal facilities will have a material effect on the results of its operations nrg south central cannot assure you however that in the future it will not incur material environmental liabilities that it will obtain all necessary permits for its operations or that it will operate in full compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations at all times in addition regulatory compliance for the construction of new facilities is a costly and timeconsuming process intricate and rapidly changing environmental regulations may require major capital expenditures for permitting and create a risk of expensive delays or material impairment of project value if projects cannot function as planned due to changing regulatory requirements or local opposition environmental laws have become increasingly stringent over time particularly with regard to the regulation of air emissions from nrg south centrals plants which requires regular major capital expenditures for power plant upgrades and modifications therefore it is nrg south centrals policy to integrate the consideration of potential environmental impacts into every decision it makes and by doing so strive to improve its competitive advantage by meeting or exceeding environmental and safety requirements pertaining to the management and operation of its assets see item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental matters   energy regulation       various federal and state laws pertaining to power generation and sales also affect nrg south central the federal power act regulates the sale of electricity in the wholesale market the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is an independent agency within the department of energy that regulates the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the federal  table of contents power act ferc is also responsible for licensing and inspecting private municipal and stateowned hydro electric projects ferc determines whether a public utility qualifies for exempt wholesale generator status ewg under the public utility holding company act which was amended by the energy policy act of        federal power act the federal power act gives ferc exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce ferc regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity and its transmission in interstate commerce as public utilities under the federal power act the federal power act also gives ferc jurisdiction to review certain transactions and numerous other activities of public utilities such as the granting of waivers of certain of the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on public utilities with costbased rate schedules       under the federal power act an entity that sells electricity in the wholesale market is a public utility subject to fercs jurisdiction public utilities are required to obtain fercs acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity because nrg south centrals operating subsidiaries sell energy and capacity in the wholesale market they are deemed to be public utilities for purposes of the federal power act in most cases ferc has granted the nrg south central operating companies the authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates in new england new york pjm pennsylvania new jersey maryland delaware and parts of the midwest the midwest and california ferc has established independent system operators isos which file market based rate tariffs subject to ferc approval these tariffsmarket rules dictate how the wholesale markets are to operate and how entities with market based rates shall be compensated within those markets the isos in these regions also control access to pricing of and the operation of the transmission grid within their footprint outside of iso controlled regions nrg south central is allowed to sell at market based rates as determined by willing buyers and sellers access to pricing for and operation of the transmission grid in such regions is controlled by the local transmission owning utility according to their pro forma open access transmission tariff oatt filed with and approved by ferc       usually fercs orders which grant nrg south central marketbased rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise the marketbased rate authority on a prospective basis if ferc subsequently determines that nrg south central possesses excessive market power if nrg south central lost its marketbased rate authority nrg south central may be required to obtain fercs acceptance of a costofservice rate schedule and may become subject to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed only on utilities with costbased rate schedules it should be noted however that nrg south central does have the right at any time to petition ferc to grant cost of service based rates pursuant to section  of the federal power act       public utility holding company act puhca the public utility holding company act known as puhca provides that any entity that owns controls or has the power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of an electric utility company or a holding company for an electric utility company is subject to regulation under puhca       registered holding companies under puhca are required to limit their utility operations to a single integrated utility system and divest any other operations that are not functionally related to the operation of the utility system in addition a company that is a subsidiary of a holding company registered under puhca is subject to financial and organizational regulation including approval by the sec of certain financings and transactions under the energy policy act of  however ferc can determine that a company engaged exclusively in the business of owning or operating an eligible facility used for the generation of electric energy for sale at wholesale is an ewg accordingly it is exempt from puhca requirements in the case of facilities previously operated by regulated utilities ferc can make an exempt wholesale generator determination only after the state utility commission finds that allowing the facility or facilities to be eligible for exempt wholesale generator status will benefit consumers is in the public interest and does not violate state law each of nrg south centrals operating subsidiaries has been designated by ferc as an ewg or is otherwise exempt from puhca because it is a qualifying facility under the public utility regulatory policy act of   table of contents       nrg south central does not expect to engage in any activities that will subject it to regulation under puhca if nrg south central were to lose its ewg status it would become subject to regulation under puhca it would be difficult for nrg south central to comply with puhca absent a substantial restructuring   state energy regulation       with the exception of the provision of utility services by certain utilities in new orleans and certain municipal utilities the louisiana public service commission or lpsc regulates all public utilities within louisiana the jurisdiction of the louisiana public service commission lpsc over these public utilities generally includes authority to regulate the rates services and securities of any entity furnishing electric service in the state however louisiana law does not specifically address the status of entities providing electricity exclusively in the wholesale market the lpsc has recognized that ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale rates however the  distribution cooperatives to which louisiana generating sells a majority of the energy and capacity generated by the cajun facilities will continue to be regulated by the lpsc       nrg south centrals louisiana generating production facilities provide a substantial amount of their power production to four louisiana power distribution cooperatives under multiyear form c contracts those contracts are currently set to expire in  nrg south central has negotiated replacement contracts with the cooperatives having terms of five to ten years those replacements are subject to lpsc and ferc approval the lpsc is currently evaluating those contracts ferc action will follow lpsc action on these contracts there can be no assurance that the lpsc or ferc will ultimately approve those contracts as negotiated or at all competition       the entire independent power industry in the united states is in turmoil many of nrg south centrals competitors have announced plans to scale back their growth sell assets and restructure their finances the results of the wholesale restructuring of the independent power industry are impossible to predict but they may include consolidation within the industry the sale or liquidation of certain competitors the reregulation of certain markets and the longterm reduction in new investment into the industry under any scenario however nrg south central anticipates that it will continue to face competition from numerous companies in the industry some of which may have more extensive operating experience larger staffs and greater financial resources than nrg south central presently possesses       many companies in the regulated utility industry with which the independent power industry is closely linked are also restructuring or reviewing their strategies several of these companies are discontinuing going forward with unregulated investments seeking to divest of their unregulated subsidiaries or attempting to have their regulated subsidiaries acquire their unregulated subsidiaries this may lead to an increased competition between the regulated utilities and the unregulated power producers within certain markets in such instances nrg south central may compete with regulated utilities in the development of market designs and rulemaking       ferc however is attempting to level the competitive playing field between regulated utilities and unregulated energy suppliers by providing open nondiscriminatory access to electricity markets and the transmission grid in april  ferc issued orders  and  that required all public utilities to file open access transmission tariffs that give wholesale generators as well as other wholesale sellers and buyers of electricity access to transmission facilities on a nondiscriminatory basis this led to the formation of the isos described above on december   ferc issued order  encouraging the creation of regional transmission organizations rtos finally on july   ferc issued its notice of proposed rulemaking regarding standard market design all three orders were intended to eliminate market discrimination by incumbent vertically integrated utilities and to provide for open access to the transmission grid       the full effect of these changes on nrg south central is uncertain at this time because in many parts of the united states it has not been determined how entities will attempt to comply with fercs initiatives at  table of contents this time five isos have been approved and are operational new england isone new york nyiso pennsylvania nj maryland de and parts of the midwest collectively pjm central midwest miso south central spp and in california ca iso two of these isos pjm and miso have been found to also qualify as rtos three other entities have also requested that ferc approve their organizations as rtos westconnect desert southwest rto west pacific northwest and rockies and setrans southeast       in the southeast entergy and southern company continue to support their rto setrans the future of setrans is uncertain given the recent loss of santee cooper       proposals have been introduced in congress to repeal purpa and puhca and ferc has publicly indicated support for the puhca repeal effort if the repeal of purpa or puhca occurs either separately or as part of legislation designed to encourage the broader introduction of wholesale and retail competition the significant competitive advantages that independent power producers currently enjoy over certain regulated utility companies would be eliminated or sharply curtailed and the ability of regulated utility companies to compete more directly with independent power companies would be increased to the extent competitive pressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more characteristics of a commodity business the economics of domestic independent power generation projects may come under increasing pressure deregulation may not only continue to fuel the current trend toward consolidation among domestic utilities but may also encourage the disaggregation of verticallyintegrated utilities into separate generation transmission and distribution businesses       in addition the independent system operators who oversee most of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed and may in the future continue to impose price caps and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets for example the independent system operator for the new york power pool and the california independent system operator have imposed price caps these types of price caps and other mechanisms in new york california the new england power pool and elsewhere may adversely impact the profitability of nrg energys and nrg south centrals generation facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets finally the regulatory and legislative changes that have recently been enacted in a number of states in an effort to promote competition are novel and untested in many respects these new approaches to the sale of electric power have very short operating histories and it is not yet clear how they will operate in times of market stress or pressure given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful longterm price history in many of these markets and the imposition of price caps by independent system operators power markets       nrg south central sells energy and capacity generated primarily from the cajun facilities to cooperative customers under mostly fixedprice long term agreements in the southeast power markets primarily in louisiana in addition through nrg power marketing nrg south central sells excess energy and capacity into neighboring regions   southeast power market       the southeast power market consists of louisiana mississippi tennessee alabama georgia arkansas northwest florida and east texas state public utilities commissions and state assemblies within the southeast power market have been slower than other parts of the country to restructure the electricity industry most states in the southeast power market including louisiana have decided not to pursue retail competition immediately deciding instead to observe the impact of direct retail access on other states that have taken a more aggressive approach towards restructuring texas is the only state in the southeast power market that is has implemented industry restructuring legislation       the southeast power market is currently a bilateral market functioning without an independent system operator a power pool or a price exchange therefore all scheduling coordination and market pricing are determined on a control area basis by each market entity rather than by a single pool market clearing house  table of contents significant customers       cajun electric was a rural electric generation and transmission cooperative formed in  and was whollyowned by its members the distribution cooperatives the distribution cooperatives purchased their electric energy requirements from cajun electric for more than  years under longterm all requirements power supply agreements following nrg south centrals acquisition of the cajun facilities all  of the distribution cooperatives continued to purchase their electric energy requirements from louisiana generating for the years ended december   and  revenues derived from agreements with the distribution cooperatives accounted for approximately  and  of nrg south centrals total revenues respectively in total nrg south central derived approximately  and  of its revenues for the years ended december   and  from longterm allrequirements power supply agreements with the distribution cooperatives and other wholesale customers       during  two customers accounted for  of nrg south centrals gross revenues southwest louisiana electric membership corporation  and dixie electric membership corporation  during  two customers accounted for  of nrg south centrals gross revenues southwest louisiana electric membership corporation  and dixie electric membership corporation  employees       as of december   louisiana generating had  union and  nonunion employees with respect to union employees all such employees are covered by current labor agreements with either the united steelworkers of america or the international brotherhood of electrical workers these agreements were renewed in march  and expire april   no significant labor stoppages or disputes have been experienced by nrg south central nrg south central does not have any employees seasonality and price volatility       annual and quarterly operating results can be significantly affected by weather and price volatility significant other events such as the war in iraq and the precipitous decline in natural gas inventories and productive capacity have combined to increase fuel and power price volatility sources and availability of raw materials       nrg south centrals raw material requirements primarily include various forms of fossil fuel energy sources including natural gas and coal nrg south central obtains its natural gas and coal from multiple sources and availability is generally not an issue although localized shortages can and do occur the prices of natural gas and coal are subject to macro and microeconomic forces that can change dramatically in both the short term and the long term for example the prices of natural gas and oil have been particularly high during the winter of  due to weather volatility and geopolitical uncertainty in the middle east natural gas and coal represented approximately  of nrg south centrals cost of operations during the year ended december     coal supplier and transporters       louisiana generating has a coal supply agreement with triton coal for a term of five years which began in march  triton coal headquartered in gillette wyoming operates two coal mines in the powder river basin in wyoming       louisiana generating has a coal transportation agreement with

central is subject to a broad range of federal state and local energy and environmental laws and regulations applicable to the development ownership and operation of its projects these laws and regulations generally require that a number of permits and approvals be obtained before construction or operation of a power plant commences and that after completion the facility operate in compliance with local requirements nrg south central strives to comply with the terms of all such laws regulations permits and licenses and believes that all of its operating plants are in material compliance with all such applicable requirements no assurance can be given however that in the future all necessary permits and approvals will be obtained and all applicable statutes and regulations will be complied with in addition regulatory compliance for the construction of new facilities is a costly and timeconsuming process and intricate and rapidly changing environmental regulations may require major expenditures for permitting and create the risk of expensive delays or material impairment of project value if projects cannot function as planned due to changing regulatory requirements or local opposition furthermore there can be no assurance that existing regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to nrg south central which would have an adverse impact on its operations         general     nrg south central and its subsidiaries like most industrial enterprises are subject to regulation with respect to the environmental impact of their operations including air and water quality control limitations on land use disposal of wastes aesthetics and other matters         federal power act     the federal power act gives the federal energy regulatory commission ferc exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce pursuant to the federal power act all public utilities subject to fercs jurisdiction are required to file rate schedules with ferc prior to commencement of wholesale sales or transmission of electricity because louisiana generating sells energy and capacity in the wholesale market it is deemed to be a public utility for purposes of the federal power act and has been granted this authority by ferc in its orders ferc also granted waivers of certain of the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on public utilities with costbased rate schedules          in addition fercs orders as is customary with marketbased rate schedules reserve the right to suspend upon complaint marketbased rate authority on a prospective basis if it is subsequently determined that market power was exercised if ferc were to suspend marketbased rate authority it would most likely be necessary to file and obtain ferc acceptance of costbased rate schedules in addition the loss of marketbased rate authority would likely subject nrg south central to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on public utilities with costbased rate schedules          public utility holding company act puhca a public utility company that is a subsidiary of a registered holding company under puhca is subject to financial and organizational regulation including approval by the sec of certain of its financing transactions however under the energy policy act a company engaged exclusively in the business of owning andor operating a facility used for the generation of electric energy exclusively for sale at wholesale may be exempted from puhca regulation by means of its status as an exempt wholesale generator ewg as defined under section  of puhca louisiana generating and all of nrg south centrals subsidiaries are ewgs and have received confirmation from ferc of their ewg status         if louisiana generating or any other of nrg south centrals subsidiairies were to lose their ewg status they would be subject to regulation as a public utility company and certain of its affiliates would be subject to regulation under puhca as public utility holding companies absent a substantial restructuring of nrg south centrals business it would be difficult to comply with puhca without a material adverse effect on its business         state law     with the exception of the provision of utility services by certain utilities in new orleans and certain municipal utilities the louisiana public service commission or lpsc regulates all public utilities within louisiana the jurisdiction of the louisiana public service commission lpsc over these public utilities generally includes authority to regulate the rates services and securities of any entity furnishing electric service in the state however louisiana law does not specifically address the status of entities providing electricity exclusively at wholesale the lpsc has recognized that ferc has jurisdiction over wholesale rates however the  distribution cooperatives to which louisiana generating sells a majority of the energy and capacity generated by the cajun facilities will continue to be regulated by the lpsc customers         cajun electric was a rural electric generation and transmission cooperative formed in  and was whollyowned by its members the distribution cooperatives the distribution cooperatives purchased their electric energy requirements from cajun electric for more than  years under longterm all requirements power supply agreements following nrg south centrals acquisition of the cajun facilities all  of the distribution cooperatives continued to purchase their electric energy requirements from louisiana generating for the year ended december   revenues derived from

december   from longterm allrequirements power supply agreements with the distribution cooperatives and other wholesale customers         during the yearended december   sales to two customers southwest louisiana electric membership corporation and dixie electric membership corporation accounted for approximately  and  of nrg south centrals total revenues respectively         customers of

energy reliability council sercentergy region through nrg power marketing  power markets         nrg south central sells energy and capacity generated primarily by the cajun facilities in the southeast power market primarily in louisiana in addition through nrg power marketing nrg south central sells excess energy and capacity into the serc region or into other neighboring regions southeast power market         the southeast power market consists of louisiana mississippi tennessee alabama georgia arkansas northwest florida and east texas state public utilities commissions and state assemblies within the southeast power market have been slower than other parts of the country to restructure the electricity industry most states in the southeast power market including louisiana have decided not to pursue retail competition immediately deciding instead to observe the impact of direct retail access on other states that have taken a more aggressive approach towards restructuring texas is the only state in the southeast power market that is moving forward with industry restructuring legislation         the southeast power market is currently a bilateral market functioning without an independent system operator a power pool or a price exchange therefore all scheduling coordination and market pricing are determined on a control area basis by each market entity rather than by a single pool market clearing house employees         as of december   louisiana generating had  union and  nonunion employees with respect to union employees all such employees

units  at big cajun ii  million over the same time period is reserved for nox controls on the steam boilers at big cajun i these expenditures appear to be in response to a change in law and therefore recoverable via passthrough to the cooperatives approximately  million will be spent over the next two years to reduce particulate matter emissions during startup of the big cajun ii boilers and  million for expanding the existing boiling ash pond at the big cajun ii plant site neither of these capital expenditures is related to a change in law remediation         under various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of any facility including an electric generating facility may be required to investigate and remediate past releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products located at the facility and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by the party in connection with any releases or threatened releases these laws including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances and courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict and joint and several the cost of investigation remediation or removal of any hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products could be substantial nrg south central believes however that the risk of material remediation liability in connection with its ownership and operation of the cajun facilities is low because they were greenfield facilities when constructed and had no history of large offsite shipments of hazardous waste from the facilities during  and  there were no significant expenditures made
