intravenous iv iron n   enrolled in the feeforservice medicare program from january  to december  were the focus of recent study which compared the risk of anaphylaxis among patients and products share full story cunlin wang md phd of the us food and drug administration silver spring md and colleagues studied recipients of intravenous iv iron n   enrolled in the feeforservice medicare program from january  to december  the study appears in the november  issue of jama in  anemia affected one third of the global population and iron deficiency was the most common cause oral iron replacement is the primary treatment strategy for iron deficiency anemia but may be inadequate for some patients due to intolerance impaired absorption significant ongoing bleeding or nonadherence for these patients intravenous iron may be indicated as of june  there were  iv iron products marketed in the united states while their efficacy is established the most important safety concern relates to the risk of serious and fatal anaphylaxis an allergic reaction to a substance which may occur at both first and subsequent exposures the comparative safety of each product has not been well established according to background information in the article this study examined administrations of iv iron dextran gluconate sucrose or ferumoxytol a total of  anaphylaxis cases were identified at first exposure with an additional  cases identified during subsequent iv iron administrations the researchers found that iron dextran was associated with increased anaphylaxis risk compared with nondextran formulations at first administration among the nondextran products the risk of anaphylaxis at first administration was higher with both iron gluconate and ferumoxytol than with iron sucrose because each iv iron product has a specific recommended dose and schedule of administration the cumulative risk of anaphylaxis was also calculated based on both the number of administrations and clinically relevant repletion level of iron  mg achieved within  weeks both analyses showed iron dextran was associated with the highest cumulative risk of anaphylaxis and iron sucrose with the lowest risk the authors note that the mechanism of anaphylactic reaction after iv iron remains unknown story source materials provided by jama  journal of the american medical associationuzrxvuyfwsfrf note content
