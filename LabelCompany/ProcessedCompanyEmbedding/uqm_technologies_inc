information incorporated by reference should be carefully considered before investing in our securities   risks related to our business we have incurred significant net losses and may continue to do so we have incurred significant net losses as shown in the following tables quarter ended june    net loss     fiscal year ended march     net loss       we have had accumulated deficits as follows june     march     march     in the future we plan to make additional investments in product development and commercialization which is likely to cause us to remain unprofitable   our net losses and working capital requirements could consume our current cash balances our net loss for the first quarter ended june   was  versus a net loss for the comparable quarter last year of  at june   our cash balances were  for our most recently completed fiscal year ended march   we had a net loss of  which includes the impairment of the carrying value of our discontinued electronic products segment and other estimated losses from the discontinuance of this business totaling  if our losses continue they could consume some or all of our cash balances management expects to make additional investments in human resources manufacturing facilities and equipment production and application engineering among other things in order to effectively compete in the emerging market for hybrid electric vehicles which we expect will expand our operating losses and require us to secure additional funding beyond our existing cash resources we cannot assure you however that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us if at all   our government contracts can be cancelled with little or no notice and could restrict our ability to commercialize our technology some of our technology has been developed under government funding by united states government agencies in some cases government agencies in the united states can require us to obtain or produce components for our systems from sources located in the united states rather than foreign countries our contracts with government agencies are also subject to the risk of termination at the convenience of the contracting agency and in some cases grant marchin rights to the government marchin rights are the right of the united states government or the applicable government agency under limited circumstances to exercise a nonexclusive royaltyfree irrevocable worldwide license to any technology developed under contracts funded by the government to facilitate commercialization of technology developed with government funding marchin rights can be exercised if we fail to commercialize the developed technology the implementation of restrictions on our sourcing of components or the exercise of marchin rights by the government or an agency of the government could restrict our ability to commercialize our technology   we face intense competition in our motor development and may be unable to compete successfully in developing electric motors for use in vehicles and other applications we face competition from very large domestic and international companies including the worlds largest automobile manufacturers these companies have far greater resources to apply to research and development efforts than we have and they may independently develop motors that are technologically more advanced than ours   if we are unable to protect our patents and other proprietary technology we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology which would impair our competitiveness and ability to commercialize our products in addition the cost of enforcing our proprietary rights may be expensive and result in increased losses our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our industry will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology although we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights we do not know whether we have been or will be successful in doing so we have historically pursued patent protection in a limited number of foreign countries where we believe significant markets for our products exist or where potentially significant competitors have operations it is possible that a substantial market could develop in a country where we have not received patent protection and under such circumstances our proprietary products would not be afforded legal protection in these markets further our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours we cannot assure that additional patents will be issued to us or if they are issued as to the scope of their protection patents granted may not provide meaningful protection from competitors even if a competitors products were to infringe patents owned by us it would be costly for us to pursue our rights in an enforcement action it would divert funds and resources which otherwise could be used in our operations and we cannot assure that we would be successful in enforcing our intellectual property rights in addition effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country where we may operate or sell our products in the future if third parties assert technology infringement claims against us the defense of the claims could involve significant legal costs and require our management to divert time and attention from our business operations if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement we may be forced to obtain licenses or to pay royalties to continue to use our technology we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we fail to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or if these licenses are costly our results of operations may suffer either from reductions in revenues through our inability to serve customers or from increases in costs to license thirdparty technologies   use of our motors in vehicles could subject us to product liability claims and product liability insurance claims could cause an increase in our insurance rates or could exceed our insurance limits which could impair our financial condition results of operations and liquidity because some of our motors are designed to be used in vehicles and because vehicle accidents can cause injury to persons and property we are subject to a risk of claims for product liability we carry product liability insurance of  million covering all of our products if we were to experience a large insured loss it might exceed our coverage limits or our insurance carriers could decline to further cover us or raise our insurance rates to unacceptable levels any of which could impair our financial position results of operations and liquidity   we are defending a lawsuit that has been brought against our wholly owned subsidiary uqm electronics inc involving breach of contract and other claims an adverse outcome of this lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our  financial condition results of operations and liquidity a lawsuit has been filed against our wholly owned subsidiary uqm electronics inc alleging breach of contract and other claims the claimed damages exceed our working capital for a description of this legal action see legal proceedings in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   delivered with this prospectus we believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to contest it vigorously however the action is in a preliminary phase and the ultimate outcome is uncertain an adverse outcome of this lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity     risks related to this

software control algorithms in the controller to extract the most power with the least loss this leads to extremely high efficiency over a very wide speed and power range all of our efficiency curves are published based on actual test data not calculations taken from calibrated dynamometers certified by tuv for ece r testing in addition all of our efficiency curves are provided at the system level dc into the controller to the mechanical shaft output an efficiency map from a typical uqm system is shown to the left for efficiency maps of specific uqm systems contact uqm sales cost saving potential uqm systems allow the use of significantly less batteries due to high system efficiency in turn highefficiency systems reduce battery content and lower cost batteries represent  of an
