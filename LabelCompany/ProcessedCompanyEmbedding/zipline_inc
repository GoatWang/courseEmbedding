professional instruction or advice all written or spoken material is opinion and does not guarantee safety all persons are wholly responsible for the safe selection installation and operation of their play equipment obtaining professional advice and instruction when installing your zip line is strongly encouraged basic instructions black raptor kit hornet zipline kit torpedo  ultimate harness kit brake block kit print all instructions step  – locate anchors make sure you have two solid anchors to attach the zip line to for example  trees they are suitable enough to allow about a  drop in cable that is a ’’ drop for every ’ of cable and they allow a clear path for the rider if there isn’t a clear line you will want to do some clearing or trimming until it is safe for the rider usually you want a minimum of ’ of clearance all the way down the zip line path cable sag is also something to consider when determining the height of your zip line on average you will see about a  sag or ’ for every ’ of cable the cable sag measurement is only used to give you an idea of how low you will hang while on the zip line use this measurement to determine whether or not you will have enough ground clearance while riding step  – determine cable ending  starting attachment height figuring out the cable height for your zip line is an important step you want to get it high enough to not hit the ground while zip lining but low enough to make it as safe as possible for riding every zip line will be different depending on the land layout and distance traveled for example we will set up a ′ zip line between  trees on level ground it is easiest to decide the end height first and then figure out the starting point in most cases ′ – ′ at the end will land you really close to the ground in our ′ example we are going to end the zip line at ′ high make a mark on the ending anchor at this point to let you know where the cable will be wrapping the anchor the ending point of the zip line usually won’t change because you will always want to end on the ground the starting point of the zip line will typically determine the speed and safety of the line the less drop you have in cable height from start to finish the slower it will run if you are going to use the zip line without a ‘brake block kit’ then we recommend using a slower run or leaving slack in the line to the point that you are traveling uphill at the end of the ride working as a natural brake now to find out the height of the start of the zip line we will add the ’ ending point plus the  –  drop in our example with a  drop ’ x   ’  this will give us a starting height for our zip line of ’ off of the ground mark the starting anchor at ’ high this is where the cable sling will wrap around the starting anchor for determining cable height on a sloped grade you can subtract the amount of slope from the starting cable height for example if your property slopes ’ over your ’ long zip line then you can subtract the ’ from the ’ starting height you would then in this situation start at ’ high and end at ’ high install the zip line on a slightly sloped grade keeps the riders closer to the ground and makes the ride a little safer step  – setting up starting anchor if your going to use boards or a rubber hose to protect a tree or anchor install those now wrap the cable sling around the starting anchor at the mark you made in step  sometimes it helps to put a few nails in around the anchor to keep the chain in place next extend the turnbuckle and attach one end of the turnbuckle to the loose ends of the cable sling and tighten down the bolt then attach the thimble end of the zipline cable and attach it to the other end of the turnbuckle step  – wrapping cable around ending anchor if your going to use boards or a rubber hose to protect a tree or anchor install those now wrap the loose end of the cable around the ending anchor at the mark made in step  pull the cable around the ending anchor as tightly as possible towards the starting anchor having a partner to pull the cable tight or using a come along while you tighten the clamps is very helpful put the cable clamp around the cable and the loose end making sure the ubolt part of the clamp is on the dead end of the cable the end that was pulled around the anchor tighten the first clamp  or  feet from the ending anchor next loosely put the next clamp on the cable on the anchor side of the first clamp slide the clamp about half way toward the anchor then tighten at this point next put the last clamp on the cable on the anchor side of the second clamp slide the clamp as close as you can get it to the anchor tighten at this point step  – adjust sag use a wrench to adjust tightness of zip line sag can be used to your advantage at this step to slow down the rate of the rider at the end of the run a tighter zip line may give you more consistent speed throughout the length of the run step  – install safety loop thread the safety line through the chain sling ends and zipline thimble as shown then attach the safety line to itself as shown with two ubolts about ” apart step  – attaching accessories below are instructions for

persons are wholly responsible for the safe selection installation and operation of their play equipment obtaining professional advice and instruction when installing your zip line is strongly encouraged step  – disassemble brake block first use a wrench and unbolt the  bolts holding the brake block together and pull brake block apart step  – install brake block bolt the brake block together closest at the end of the zipline ‘in front’ of the trolley with the zip line cable running through the middle make sure the eye bolt is closest to the end of the zip line to avoid contacting quicklink with some trolley handles step  – locate anchor  choose bungee length preferably use a solid anchor such as a tree that is ’ to ’ off the side of the zip line and ’ from the end of the zip line you can adjust the length of the bungee to accommodate the location of an existing anchor as long as the brake block naturally rests halfway between the end of the zip line and the brake block anchor after installation typically the bungee will stretch to double its length and will be adjusted depending on the speed and weight of the rider while traveling on the zip line you can install the lag screw eye bolt in the anchor tree attach to a × set  feet into the ground or install the ground anchor accessory at the chosen location step  – attach bungee make a loop in one end of the bungee and attach a quicklink to it and then to the brake block close and secure the quick link take the other end of the bungee and create a loop at a location that will make the distance between the two loops half the distance of that between the anchor and the ending tree then attach the remaining quicklink to the newly created loop in the bungee and then to the anchor verify the brake block naturally rests halfway between the end of the zip line and the anchor after installation and that the anchor is off to the side of the zip line  to ’ so you don’t run into the bungee rope when riding down the zip line step  – test run make sure and test your brake block using your trolley and weights before you ride the bungee rope will probably need adjustments depending upon the weight and speed of the riders the easiest way to adjust the brake is to unscrew the anchor and move it to a new location when using a ground anchor or you can change the length of the bungee load morefollow us

instructions black raptor kit hornet zipline kit torpedo  ultimate harness kit brake block kit print all instructions step  – locate anchors make sure you have two solid anchors to attach the zip line to for example  trees they are suitable enough to allow about a  drop in cable that is a ’’ drop for every ’ of cable and they allow a clear path for the rider if there isn’t a clear line you will want to do some clearing or trimming until it is safe for the rider usually you want a minimum of ’ of clearance all the way down the zip line path cable sag is also something to consider when determining the height of your zip line on average you will see about a  sag or ’ for every ’ of cable the cable sag measurement is only used to give you an idea of how low you will hang while on the zip line use this measurement to determine whether or not you will have enough ground clearance while riding step  – determine cable ending  starting attachment height figuring out the cable height for your zip line is an important step you want to get it high enough to not hit the ground while zip lining but low enough to make it as safe as possible for riding every zip line will be different depending on the land layout and distance traveled for example we will set up a ′ zip line between  trees on level ground it is easiest to decide the end height first and then figure out the starting point in most cases ′ – ′ at the end will land you really close to the ground in our ′ example we are going to end the zip line at ′ high make a mark on the ending anchor at this point to let you know where the cable will be wrapping the anchor the ending point of the zip line usually won’t change because you will always want to end on the ground the starting point of the zip line will typically
