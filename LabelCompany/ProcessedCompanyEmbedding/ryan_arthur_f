prudential financial  broad street newark new jersey  httpwwwprudentialcom ■ as the first outsider to be named chief executive officer ceo and chairman of prudential insurance company of america arthur f ryan took charge at a time of turmoil he oversaw the conversion of the company from a mutual form of ownership in which policyholders owned the insurer to stock ownership resulting in the publicly traded prudential financial which gained a listing on the new york stock exchange in  although regarded as unpretentious and possessing a warm and friendly manner ryan was also known for his tough management style while serving as president of chase manhattan bank he earned the nickname the gorilla his technology background he began in chases dataprocessing department was also seemingly at odds with his peopleoriented approach to business ryan devoted a good deal of time to charitable works while at prudential as the company donated millions of dollars to support the arts and educational activities in its home state of new jersey ryan regarded many of these public works as simply good business thereby demonstrating his ability to balance the hardnosed and amiable sides of his personality if he had not become a chief executive at a major corporation ryan claimed he would have become a teacher brooklyn born long island raised ryan was born in  in brooklyn new york and raised on long island he graduated from providence college in  earning a ba in mathematics it was during his college days that he gained his only sales experience selling magazines during one summer he then served a twoyear stint as a lieutenant in the us army serving in washington dc with the army security agency during his time in washington he furthered his education by taking classes at american university following his discharge in  ryan went to work as a computersystems designer for control data corporation and later gained managerial experience when he was appointed area manager he would put this combination of experience to use at chase when he joined the bank in  thomas labrecque a career catalyst ryan began his career at chase as a project manager in the dataprocessing division and soon began ascending the ranks of the institution in  he was put in charge of securities processing and a year later became head of the entire securities processing business ryan received a major career break in  when a treasury department executive thomas g labrecque recognized his potential and promoted the relatively obscure ryan to oversee all of the banks domestic wholesale operations including check processing wire transfers and trust and securities services more importantly ryan formed a close bond with labrecque who in  became a surprise choice for president at chase ryan reported directly to labrecque for the rest of his tenure at the bank the two men formed a good team possessing complimentary abilities labrecque was described as aloof and pedigreed a far cry from the rolledupsleeves straighttalking approach of ryan in  ryan was appointed to the banks policy and planning committee which was composed of  top executives who met on a quarterly basis to determine bank policy in  labrecque expanded ryans job giving him overview responsibilities for all of the banks systems worldwide including those employed by retail operations the experience he gained on the retail side would be put to good use two years later in  chases consumerbanking business was reorganized and ryan was installed as its head with the title of executive vice president responsible for retailbanking operations around the world a year later he became a vice chairman for the personable and downtoearth ryan the move into the consumer area was a welcome change allowing him to put his own experience as a consumer to good use in determining new product lines its always nice to be in a business where youre one of them he told american banker in a  profile the consumer bank performed well under his leadership enjoying a compound growth rate of  percent over the next four years ryan gave much of the credit for the operations success to the decision of labrecque and chairman willard c butcher in the late s to aggressively pursue the retail business at a time when it wasnt a very popular choice to make ryan went on to tell american banker  i had the opportunity to demonstrate that if we had the resources and spent them wisely we could really do something the gorilla labrecque succeeded butcher as chairman in  and named ryan as his replacement as president and to serve as his second in command the two faced some major challenges along with butcher they had been instrumental in taking chase public in october  offering such a promising picture of earnings that chase was able to raise  million rather than the  million envisioned investors were not pleased however when the bank soon developed problems with some realestate loans and the corporatefinancing market went soft resulting in chase falling short of its projections labrecque and ryan responded by ruthlessly slashing costs streamlining the operation by eliminating layers of management and focusing the banks resources on its strongest businesses as a result they restored chase to profitability and ryan earned his reputation as the gorilla he may have been informal and warm but according to one colleague at the end of the day you deliver or you are history  businessweek  august   ryan at  years of age had reached a plateau in his career at chase with labrecque only four years older there appeared little chance that he would ever take the next step and become chairman of the bank thus when presented with the opportunity to become ceo and chairman at prudential insurance ryan accepted his appointment marked the first time in the insurers year history that it had turned to an outsider and someone without experience in the industry but given the difficult straits in which prudential found itself there was good reason to look outside the company even if the move risked demoralizing the executive ranks challenges at prudential for decades prudential had traded on a solid reputation portraying itself as the rock but the mutual company which came into existence to provide industrial insurance to the working class paying for funeral and burial costs expanded in the s into financial products and landed in trouble by the early s the company was beset by a number of scandals as well as other endemic problems the insurer had to admit that its securities unit had sold partnerships fraudulently a mistake that would cost  billion to correct prudential also faced scrutiny on its lifeinsurancesales practices leading to a multistate regulatory investigation in addition the company posted a string of disappointing earnings and endured high restructuring costs that—along with  billion in losses from hurricane andrew in  and a drop in the value of its realestate and bond holdings—hurt profitability ryan also faced the difficult challenge of fundamentally changing a staid corporate culture that could in its own way warrant being called the rock businessweek offered one insiders take of the situation in a  article this has been a company where the ceo could make a decision and some guy four layers down could derail it august   rebuilding the rock to address the problems at prudential ryan had to use both the personable and the tough sides of his character as well as rely on his technical background to resolve the companys lifeinsurancesales problem ryan encouraged new jerseys insurance commissioner to launch an investigation even though prudentials home state was not one of the six looking into allegations that prudential agents had deceived customers into buying new expensive lifeinsurance policies as a way to pocket commissions without regard for the needs of the policyholders thus new jersey examiners led the multistate probe that resulted in prudential being fined  million the largest fine ever levied against an insurer and agreeing to a settlement package that would pay  million to  billion to victimized policyholders although on the surface the punishment appeared stiff critics claimed that ryan had in fact engineered a sweetheart deal given that prudential held assets worth  billion the  million fine was not especially significant and the terms of the settlement placed the burden of proof on policyholders to show they had been wronged the day after the settlement was announced ryan began the process of repairing prudentials tarnished image taking out fullpage newspaper ads to apologize for the companys intolerable sales practices  businessweek  august   he fired hundreds of agents and managers restructured the sales system and established strong internal controls ryan took other steps to improve the financials both for the short and longterm he launched an  million annual costsavings program and sold off more than  billion in businesses that were not considered core to the companys future as he had done at chase ryan also streamlined prudentials management although he placed a great deal of emphasis on saving money ryan was not averse to making investments that would benefit prudential over the long haul he may have been an outofdate technologist but he still recognized the need to improve the companys information technology it he spent large sums to upgrade prudentials it infrastructure and under his leadership the company was in the vanguard of providing laptops and later wireless handheld computers to sales agents in  ryan first began discussing the programming problems associated with the change to the year  according to his chief information officer bill friel he recognized all the metrics the code the function points and understood the issues associated with that and how to plan and manage the program  insurance and technology  september  as a result prudential was able to get started on the conversion well before its rivals ryans understanding of the role technology could play in business was also evident in the way he incorporated it functions throughout the company to employ technology for even greater effect he also looked to technology to help prudential deal with compliance issues especially important in light of the sales scandals the company had endured in recent years a handson approach just as ryan was making progress on some fronts his momentum in turning around prudential would be stunted by fresh problems the companys healthinsurance business for instance was losing hundreds of millions of dollars prudential had been one of the pioneers in health care establishing a healthmaintenance organization in the early s but with increased competition in the managedcare sector in the s prudential was unable to keep expenses in line with revenues as a result the company underperformed the market leading to the resignations of the divisions top two executives always the handson leader ryan stepped in to run the division himself until replacements could be hired he ultimately decided prudential needed to leave the healthcare industry aside from providing longterm coverage ryan and prudential also faced continued problems with state regulators dissatisfied with the lifeinsurance settlement the florida insurance commissioner in particular threatened to suspend the companys license to do business in florida charity a priority from the start of his tenure at prudential ryan attempted to treat the insurer as a public company in preparation of one day demutualizing it converting the company from a mutual form of ownership in which policyholders owned the insurer to stock ownership part of that effort involved good corporate citizenship and involving prudential in charitable works for ryan whose wife patricia was a community activist public work was a personal value as well much of prudentials financial support was devoted to newark new jersey where the company was headquartered it spent  million to have the main concert hall of the new jersey performing arts center named after it and coendowed a foundation that would buy and provide master plans for properties surrounding the arts center ryan and his wife supplemented the donation to the arts center with personal contributions prudential also established a  million challenge grant for the citys public schools and donated  of the  needed to subsidize the feebased buses that circled downtown newark in a further effort to revitalize the city in addition ryan made a personal commitment to educational activities he served as a trustee to providence college where he also established the arthur ryan family scholarship in new jersey ryan agreed to help lead new jersey united an organization established to improve public education by supporting a standardsbased educational approach to public schools ryan also procured funding from prudential for new jersey united and donated staff time of two prudential employees leads prudentials conversion to stock ownership in the late s ryan began the formal process of converting prudential from a mutual to a stock company following on the heels of other mutual insurers who had taken the step earlier in the decade an initial bill authorizing the change was passed by the new jersey legislature in  but it was not until  that the process was completed a new company prudential financial was incorporated and taken public to acquire the assets of prudential insurance ryan retained the ceo post and chairmanship of the new stock company which on december   began trading on the new york stock exchange with stock at his disposal ryan was better positioned to move the company forward in a highly competitive environment where insurance and financial products were sold by insurers and bankers alike prudential could now supplement pay packages with stock options an increasingly key element in attracting topnotch executive talent moreover prudential had the capacity to use stock to fuel growth after the conversion ryan engineered a number of acquisitions including the purchase of american skandia which was the largest distributor of variable annuities through independent financial planners in the united states prudential was able to create a retailbrokerage business with wachovia corporation the resulting wachovia securities was one of the largest retail financialadvisory organizations in the united states in  prudential paid  billion for the retirement business of cigna corporation making it the largest manager of stablevalue and fundingagreement assets serving more than  million active workers and retirees prudential also looked overseas acquiring two south korean assetmanagement companies ryan who had come to prudential insurance with no experience in insurance was now taking prudential financial into many of the retailbanking areas he had nurtured during his tenure at chase at the same time he continued to repair prudentials tarnished image see also entry on prudential insurance company of america in

anniversary alumni services award and the diamond anniversary award providence college address prudential financial  broad street newark new jersey  httpwwwprudentialcom ■ as the first outsider to be named chief executive officer ceo and chairman of prudential insurance company of america arthur f ryan took charge at a time of turmoil he oversaw the conversion of the company from a mutual form of ownership in which policyholders owned the insurer to stock ownership resulting in the publicly traded prudential financial which gained a listing on the new york stock exchange in  although regarded as unpretentious and possessing a warm and friendly manner ryan was also known for his tough management style while serving as president of chase manhattan bank he earned the nickname the gorilla his technology background he began in chases dataprocessing department was also seemingly at odds with his peopleoriented approach to business ryan devoted a good deal of time to charitable works while at prudential as the company donated millions of dollars to support the arts and educational activities in its home state of new jersey ryan regarded many of these public works as simply good business thereby demonstrating his ability to balance the hardnosed and amiable sides of his personality if he had not become a chief executive at a major corporation ryan claimed he would have become a teacher brooklyn born long island raised ryan was born in  in brooklyn new york and raised on long island he graduated from providence college in  earning a ba in mathematics it was during his college days that he gained his only sales experience selling magazines during one summer he then served a twoyear stint as a lieutenant in the us army serving in washington dc with the army security agency during his time in washington he furthered his education by taking classes at american university following his discharge in  ryan went to work as a computersystems designer for control data corporation and later gained managerial experience when he was appointed area manager he would put this combination of experience to use at chase when he joined the bank in  thomas labrecque a career catalyst ryan began his career at chase as a project manager in the dataprocessing division and soon began ascending the ranks of the institution in  he was put in charge of securities processing and a year later became head of the entire securities processing business ryan received a major career break in  when a treasury department executive thomas g labrecque recognized his potential and promoted the relatively obscure ryan to oversee all of the banks domestic wholesale operations including check processing wire transfers and trust and securities services more importantly ryan formed a close bond with labrecque who in  became a surprise choice for president at chase ryan reported directly to labrecque for the rest of his tenure at the bank the two men formed a good team possessing complimentary abilities labrecque was described as aloof and pedigreed a far cry from the rolledupsleeves straighttalking approach of ryan in  ryan was appointed to the banks policy and planning committee which was composed of  top executives who met on a quarterly basis to determine bank policy in  labrecque expanded ryans job giving him overview responsibilities for all of the banks systems worldwide including those employed by retail operations the experience he gained on the retail side would be put to good use two years later in  chases consumerbanking business was reorganized and ryan was installed as its head with the title of executive vice president responsible for retailbanking operations around the world a year later he became a vice chairman for the personable and downtoearth ryan the move into the consumer area was a welcome change allowing him to put his own experience as a consumer to good use in determining new product lines its always nice to be in a business where youre one of them he told american banker in a  profile the consumer bank performed well under his leadership enjoying a compound growth rate of  percent over the next four years ryan gave much of the credit for the operations success to the decision of labrecque and chairman willard c butcher in the late s to aggressively pursue the retail business at a time when it wasnt a very popular choice to make ryan went on to tell american banker i had the opportunity to demonstrate that if we had the resources and spent them wisely we could really do something the gorilla labrecque succeeded butcher as chairman in  and named ryan as his replacement as president and to serve as his second in command the two faced some major challenges along with butcher they had been instrumental in taking chase public in october  offering such a promising picture of earnings that chase was able to raise  million rather than the  million envisioned investors were not pleased however when the bank soon developed problems with some realestate loans and the corporatefinancing market went soft resulting in chase falling short of its projections labrecque and ryan responded by ruthlessly slashing costs streamlining the operation by eliminating layers of management and focusing the banks resources on its strongest businesses as a result they restored chase to profitability and ryan earned his reputation as the gorilla he may have been informal and warm but according to one colleague at the end of the day you deliver or you are history businessweek august   ryan at  years of age had reached a plateau in his career at chase with labrecque only four years older there appeared little chance that he would ever take the next step and become chairman of the bank thus when presented with the opportunity to become ceo and chairman at prudential insurance ryan accepted his appointment marked the first time in the insurers year history that it had turned to an outsider and someone without experience in the industry but given the difficult straits in which prudential found itself there was good reason to look outside the company even if the move risked demoralizing the executive ranks challenges at prudential for decades prudential had traded on a solid reputation portraying itself as the rock but the mutual company which came into existence to provide industrial insurance to the working class paying for funeral and burial costs expanded in the s into financial products and landed in trouble by the early s the company was beset by a number of scandals as well as other endemic problems the insurer had to admit that its securities unit had sold partnerships fraudulently a mistake that would cost  billion to correct prudential also faced scrutiny on its lifeinsurancesales practices leading to a multistate regulatory investigation in addition the company posted a string of disappointing earnings and endured high restructuring costs that—along with  billion in losses from hurricane andrew in  and a drop in the value of its realestate and bond holdings—hurt profitability ryan also faced the difficult challenge of fundamentally changing a staid corporate culture that could in its own way warrant being called the rock businessweek offered one insiders take of the situation in a  article this has been a company where the ceo could make a decision and some guy four layers down could derail it august   rebuilding the rock to address the problems at prudential ryan had to use both the personable and the tough sides of his character as well as rely on his technical background to resolve the companys lifeinsurancesales problem ryan encouraged new jerseys insurance commissioner to launch an investigation even though prudentials home state was not one of the six looking into allegations that prudential agents had deceived customers into buying new expensive lifeinsurance policies as a way to pocket commissions without regard for the needs of the policyholders thus new jersey examiners led the multistate probe that resulted in prudential being fined  million the largest fine ever levied against an insurer and agreeing to a settlement package that would pay  million to  billion to victimized policyholders although on the surface the punishment appeared stiff critics claimed that ryan had in fact engineered a sweetheart deal given that prudential held assets worth  billion the  million fine was not especially significant and the terms of the settlement placed the burden of proof on policyholders to show they had been wronged the day after the settlement was announced ryan began the process of repairing prudentials tarnished image taking out fullpage newspaper ads to apologize for the companys intolerable sales practices businessweek august   he fired hundreds of agents and managers restructured the sales system and established strong internal controls ryan took other steps to improve the financials both for the short and longterm he launched an  million annual costsavings program and sold off more than  billion in businesses that were not considered core to the companys future as he had done at chase ryan also streamlined prudentials management although he placed a great deal of emphasis on saving money ryan was not averse to making investments that would benefit prudential over the long haul he may have been an outofdate technologist but he still recognized the need to improve the companys information technology it he spent large sums to upgrade prudentials it infrastructure and under his leadership the company was in the vanguard of providing laptops and later wireless handheld computers to sales agents in  ryan first began discussing the programming problems associated with the change to the year  according to his chief information officer bill friel he recognized all the metrics the code the function points and understood the issues associated with that and how to plan and manage the program insurance and technology september  as a result prudential was able to get started on the conversion well before its rivals ryans understanding of the role technology could play in business was also evident in the way he incorporated it functions throughout the company to employ technology for even greater effect he also looked to technology to help prudential deal with compliance issues especially important in light of the sales scandals the company had endured in recent years a handson approach just as ryan was making progress on some fronts his momentum in turning around prudential would be stunted by fresh problems the companys healthinsurance business for instance was losing hundreds of millions of dollars prudential had been one of the pioneers in health care establishing a healthmaintenance organization in the early s but with increased competition in the managedcare sector in the s prudential was unable to keep expenses in line with revenues as a result the company underperformed the market leading to the resignations of the divisions top two executives always the handson leader ryan stepped in to run the division himself until replacements could be hired he ultimately decided prudential needed to leave the healthcare industry aside from providing longterm coverage ryan and prudential also faced continued problems with state regulators dissatisfied with the lifeinsurance settlement the florida insurance commissioner in particular threatened to suspend the companys license to do business in florida charity a priority from the start of his tenure at prudential ryan attempted to treat the insurer as a public company in preparation of one day demutualizing it converting the company from a mutual form of ownership in which policyholders owned the insurer to stock ownership part of that effort involved good corporate citizenship and involving prudential in charitable works for ryan whose wife patricia was a community activist public work was a personal value as well much of prudentials financial support was devoted to newark new jersey where the company was headquartered it spent  million to have the main concert hall of the new jersey performing arts center named after it and coendowed a foundation that would buy and provide master plans for properties surrounding the arts center ryan and his wife supplemented the donation to the arts center with personal contributions prudential also established a  million challenge grant for the citys public schools and donated  of the  needed to subsidize the feebased buses that circled downtown newark in a further effort to revitalize the city in addition ryan made a personal commitment to educational activities he served as a trustee to providence college where he also established the arthur ryan family scholarship in new jersey ryan agreed to help lead new jersey united an organization established to improve public education by supporting a standardsbased educational approach to public schools ryan also procured funding from prudential for new jersey united and donated staff time of two prudential employees leads prudentials conversion to stock ownership in the late s ryan began the formal process of converting prudential from a mutual to a stock company following on the heels of other mutual insurers who had taken the step earlier in the decade an initial bill authorizing the change was passed by the new jersey legislature in  but it was not until  that the process was completed a new company prudential financial was incorporated and taken public to acquire the assets of prudential insurance ryan retained the ceo post and chairmanship of the new stock company which on december   began trading on the new york stock exchange with stock at his disposal ryan was better positioned to move the company forward in a highly competitive environment where insurance and financial products were sold by insurers and bankers alike prudential could now supplement pay packages with stock options an increasingly key element in attracting topnotch executive talent moreover prudential had the capacity to use stock to fuel growth after the conversion ryan engineered a number of acquisitions including the purchase of american skandia which was the largest distributor of variable annuities through independent financial planners in the united states prudential was able to create a retailbrokerage business with wachovia corporation the resulting wachovia securities was one of the largest retail financialadvisory organizations in the united states in  prudential paid  billion for the retirement business of cigna corporation making it the largest manager of stablevalue and fundingagreement assets serving more than  million active workers and retirees prudential also looked overseas acquiring two south korean assetmanagement companies ryan who had come to prudential insurance with no experience in insurance was now taking prudential financial into many of the retailbanking areas he had nurtured during his tenure at chase at the same time he continued to repair prudentials tarnished image see also entry
