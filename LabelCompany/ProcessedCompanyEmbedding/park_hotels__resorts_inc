earnings growth indicates that the current cycle hasnt reached the end of the roadi am seeking to invest in lodging reits where i see significant upsidepark hotels  resorts also has the highest ffo growth forecastedits balance sheet and operating platform are well positioned to execute these larger transactionsthe lodging reit sector is one of the most volatile reit sectors and as a result reits have historically underperformed the overall reit market the hotel reit sector typically outperforms the reit index substantially during periods of rising rates but according to floris van dijkum reit analyst with boenning  scattergood that script hasn’t worked out so far this year according to van dijkum business demand that typically accounts for  of highquality hotel demand should increase in  due to stronger corporate profitability yet we forecast marginal sector earnings growth over the next two years given a more cautious outlook on demand combined with supply growth during the past year and year periods hotels underperformed the rms by  and  respectively during the last year period however hotel reits have outperformed rms by  strong corporate earnings growth indicates that the current cycle hasnt reached the end of the road corporate profits typically drive business demand which is the largest demand driver for hotels at approximately  for highquality hotels approximately twothirds of the business demand in us hotels comes from transient not booked under group rate while group represents approximately a quarter of total hotel demand reits own around  hotels and  rooms representing approximately  of the total number of rooms in the us while this suggests that lodging reits have considerable opportunity to consolidate and produce economies of scale the limited liquidity in the sector is cause for enhanced volatility due to the choppy landscape surrounding the lodging reit sector and limited liquidity attributes i am maintaining a more cautious positioning specifically i am seeking to invest in lodging reits where i see significant upside  a combination of highquality and reliable dividend growth potential today i am adding a new reit to my intelligent reit lab and as the title to my article suggests  buy park and dont pass go  i am also adding this new reit to my durable income portfolio buy park and dont pass go based in mclean virginia park hotels  resorts nysepk was formed when hilton worldwide nysehlt spun off most of its owned real estate into a separate public reit park hotels is the latest entrant into a sector long dominated by host hotels  resorts inc nysehst which still dwarfs all other stock exchangelisted hotel reits in terms of size park hotels had a market capitalization of nearly  billion in early february while hosts market cap was more than  billion at the time in a reitcom article patrick scholes a lodging analyst at suntrust robinson humphrey said your typical hotel reit tends to have a market capitalization of anywhere from  billion to  billion prior to the formation of park hotels if you were a largecap investor who needed liquidity there was only one name in which you could invest host park hotels owns a  billion portfolio of  largescale highend hotels including iconic properties stretching from coast to coast its trophy properties include the new york hilton which spans an entire city block in midtown manhattan the landmark room hilton chicago downtown boasting nearly  square feet of meeting space and the oceanfront room hilton hawaiian village in honolulu there is strong potential in the room portfolio of upperupscale and luxury hotels and park hotels through acquisitions of like properties in leading hotel and resort markets already has holdings in  of the top  us hotel markets park is onebrand concentrated right now but the company says it seeks brand and operator diversity over time this is similar to what happened in  after marriott international nysemar spun off what is now host hotels the pictures below illustrate parks diversified exposure to attractive markets around  of hotel ebitda comes from coastal markets and  of hotel ebitda is from top  markets and resort destinations while park lacks diversified brand affiliations the company mitigates the risk by owning such a diversified portfolio its portfolios strong group positioning increases visibility into forward bookings and reduces operating volatility by enhancing the stability and predictability of revenue throughout the lodging cycle top  hotels grouptransient mix    parks strategy will be to group up and drive that mix up another bp to  group demand the portfolio contains  properties with over  sq ft of meeting space and  properties with over  sq ft of meeting space in top convention markets generating robust corporate meeting and group business supply and demand trends favor large grouporiented hotels for the foreseeable future size and scale of park creates competitive advantage park is the secondlargest publicly traded lodging reit it ranks among the top  largest reits iconic assets valued at well below replacement cost parks assets are currently valued at a significant discount to replacement cost growth through disciplined allocation the reits focus is on building a portfolio of upper upscale and luxury branded assets in top  markets and premium resort destinations it pursues largerscale deals assets and portfolios that offer significant valueadd opportunities the company seeks to diversify its brand beyond hilton and operator mix to include other global manager  franchisors park will opportunistically recycle capital selling out of slowergrowth noncore assets and reinvest in highergrowth markets less competition exists on larger transactions as only a limited number of investors have access to the equity needed to pursue  million single assets consequently the share of deals preempted and executed offmarket increases in conjunction with deal size thereby enhancing the price negotiation leverage for an eligible buyer parks balance sheet and operating platform are well positioned to execute these larger transactions the company intends to focus on owning hotels and resorts in the luxury and upper upscale segments park focuses on recognizable products compared to independent hotels struggling to differentiate their offerings loyalty programs help to drive recurring sales while lowering new customer acquisition costs hilton  million members and marriott including starwood nysestwd  million members have  of sales stemming from customers within their loyalty programs park has the ability to achieve increased directtoconsumer sales minimizing ota  wholesale commissions and increasing revenue to the company this means significantly lower distribution costs for the ota business given the negotiating power of brands park can more effective compete against airbnb privateairb particularly with respect to frequent travelers who appreciate the reliability and security of branded hotels active asset management handson approach hilton continues to manage the vast majority of parks properties it spun off oversight of operations under park creates a system of checks and balances that should eventually translate into higher profits hilton like most brand owners doesnt have corporate oversight of propertylevel management to make sure they are maximizing profits for the owner park is able to maximize each assets full potential through a focused approach on revenue management and cost containment initiatives while purposefully addressing capital needs including roi opportunities capex over  billion has been reinvested in parks hotels park has invested heavily to drive market share and ensure strong competitive positioning of its portfolio the company continues to consistently renovate to adapt to evolving customer preferences and the latest technology renovations have been focused on guestroom design open and activated lobby areas food and beverage and public spaces and modernized meeting spaces park creates value through repositioning select hotels across brands or chain scale segments and exploring adaptive reuse opportunities for highest and best use no major deferred maintenance the balance sheet park is extremely well capitalized with  million of unconsolidated jv debt pro rata the company is targeting an investment grade leverage profile over time it has a healthy fixed versus floating mix  fixed   floating park has ample liquidity with  million of unrestricted cash available as of  following the ep dividend cash portion of  million in addition to cash it has access to a  billion revolving credit facility with minimal debt maturities the reits absolute debttoebitda is at x which is higher than the peer average secondhighest park is expected to refinance its largely cmbs debt to more traditional unsecured notes as cmbs debt tends to be less flexible buy park and dont pass go i have provided my initial review of park hotels  resorts and i have concluded that the company is attractive i am initiating an immediate buy recommendation pk trades below the sector average ffo multiple of x based on  estimates its peers include hst pebblebrook hotel trust nysepeb and lasalle hotel properties nyselho heres a snapshot of parks dividend yield compared with that of the peer group as you can see it has an attractive dividend yield and also a modest affo payout ratio on january th park hotels  resorts declared a special dividend of  per share the ep dividend or approximately  million the stockcash component is expected to be split  on february th the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of share equating to a  dividend yield assuming a  ffo payout ratio and the midpoint of ffo guidance for  the potential yield could be  or bp above the lodging reit peers do you see why i am now suggesting to buy park and don’t pass go but wait it also has the highest ffo growth forecasted as illustrated below similar to realty income nyseo in the net lease reit sector park enjoys a similar size advantage in the lodging sector as the company is able to enhance price negotiations by flexing its size and financial muscle its balance sheet and operating platform are well positioned to execute these larger transactions and the company should be able to
