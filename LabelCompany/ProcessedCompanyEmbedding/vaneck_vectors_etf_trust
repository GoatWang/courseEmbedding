vaneck municipal bond cef etftake a hard look at the snetwork muni bond cef index and its methodologywe discuss various ways this etf may fit into your overall financial plansover the last few weeks i have been focusing on doing updates on previously researched closed end funds in particular over the last few articles i have been looking at various fixed income closed end funds namely municipal cefs such as the blackrock municipal income fund nysemui nuveen build america bond fund nysenbd and the nuveen amt free quality municipal income fund nysenea during the research i have discovered another interesting option for the muni cef theme and that is the vaneck vectors cef municipal income etf nysearcaxmpt an etf that invests in a portfolio of municipal closed end funds well ill be darned how did i miss this lets take a look fund basics sponsor vaneck index snetwork municipal bond closedend fund index cefmxtr aum approximately  million historical style  national muni investment objectives seeks federal taxfree income number of holdings  current yield  inception date  fees  gross  net after expense reinbursementfee waiver including underlying cef funds fees source ycharts  vaneck website why this fund vaneck does not do as good a job as many other etf and mutual fund companies putting together a sales pitch for its products on their website the best attempt at identifying it would be the small section talking about the key points of the fund source vaneck website in essence a diverisfied one ticket solution for buying a portfolio of closed end funds this would describe their point of diversification the other two potential high level of taxexempt income and the discount advantage are really a benefit of buying closed end funds and not necessarily a benefit of this particular etf the index  the fund the firm that did a better job at pitching the fund i feel is actually the index sponsor snetwork in their index presentation snetwork does a great job of both pitching the fund and explaining their index methodology below is what the index provider believes are the key features and rationale behind the index they provide for the etf source snet index presentation source snet index presentation source snet index presentation from the above we can sum up the index as that of one seeking tax free income from municipal bonds using leverage to increase returns by investing in multiple funds they can provide diversification in a variety of categories including asset class strategy and management by investing in cefs they may also benefit from buying at discounts to nav looking at how the index is constructed we start with the index eligibility source snet index presentation to be included the cef must be at least  million in market cap and registered in the united states the funds must generally have a  month average daily trading volume of at least k and reasonable fees typically  or less furthermore cefs trading at premiums of more than  are excluded next we look at the weighting methodology source snet index presentation as we can see above the index weights the cefs in the index based on the total net assets of the fund those net assets are then adjusted to reflect either the discount or premium in the price to nav then the funds are capped to  of the index furthermore any funds weighted at over  cannot be more than  combined essentially the index screens out illiquid expensive fee and premium priced cefs and weights the remaining funds based on total fund assets this is the resulting top  holdings in the index source vaneck website so how has it worked so far lets take a look performance we can first take a look at how the etf has performed against the the ishares national muni bond etf nysearcamub and the broader ishares us aggregate bond etf nysearcaagg as we can see much like the municipal cefs we have looked at over the past few articles the fund has performed well ytd being up  on a total return basis compared to a  total return gain for the unlevered ishares etf and  for the us aggregate etf xmpt total return price data by ycharts looking at a  year number however we can see a different picture simply put levered closed end funds were decimated in q  as the fed started raising interest rates xmpt total return price data by ycharts looking at a longer  year time frame we can see the benefits and characteristics of closed end funds namely leverage the vaneck etf is up more than  on a total return basis it is interesting to point out the big rollercoaster from july to december  xmpt total return price data by ycharts for the  year chart i added another set of metrics that is the price per share  change this way you can appreciate and see what percentage of the total return comes from the dividends and income rather than the actual growth in share price once again over the  year time frame xmpt has achieved a total return of over  yet not including the income the price per share is actually down  over the same timeframe mubs price fell only  and achieved a total return of  whereas agg fell  and achieved a total return of  xmpt data by ycharts lastly we can take a look at the funds since inception numbers since inception the fund has done extremely well certainly outperforming the etf competition it has achieved a price per share increase of  and a total return of  compared to  and  for mub and  and  for agg xmpt data by ycharts all great right the question is why not just buy a few good top performing cefs and save on the fees lets take a look at how the etf compares against just holding some of the individual holdings we take a look at xmpt against the nuveen amt free quality muni income fund nea the nuveen amtfree muni credit fund nvg the eaton vance muni bond fund eim and the blackrock muni intermediate duration fund mui as we can see over the ytd number the etf has performed quite well against its peers only second best to the red line representing the nuveen amt free muni fund nvg xmpt total return price data by ycharts the exact same holds true for the  year time frame xmpt total return price data by ycharts  and the  year number xmpt total return price data by ycharts on the  year time frame nearly the same picture is present although the difference in performance is significantly greater and the eaton vance fund outperformed the etf xmpt total return price data by ycharts examining the since inception however the trend resumes with xmpt taking second place again behind nvg xmpt total return price data by ycharts finally i wanted to take a look at how this managed etf does compared to the way i typically looked at diversification in cefs and that is through unit investment trusts or uits one popular sponsor is guggenheim they currently have a  year portfolio maturing this november since november th  the uit has achieved a total return of  the etf has achieved a return of  over the same time period the one thing not considered however is the dividends reinvested where the etf would incur transaction fees if reinvesting the dividend xmpt total return price data by ycharts another popular series of municipal cef uits is the first trust portfolios series one portfolio that i looked at is a  year portfolio launched in august   which is due to mature in about a month over that time frame the portfolio has returned  during the same timeframe xmpt would achieve a total return of  xmpt data by ycharts while it is not definitive i will be looking at this more closely in the future bottom line so bottom line you would of been better off just buying the nuveen amtfree muni credit closed end fund nysemktnvg it is the largest holding in the etf and it has outperformed the etf over every observed time frame the other funds the nuveen funds in particular have performed quite well as well the value of the etf i believe is that it is a  ticket solution to having a basket of muni closed end funds over buying and managing your own basket beyond that the etf will in essence automatically routinely rebalance and reallocate itself possibly saving you ticket charges i am quite sure if you picked a good basket of muni cefs and managed the quarterly rebalancing yourself you would likely come out ahead saving the  bpts fee is this fund solving some massive cef problem no not at all what it is however is a good introductory investment for those looking at closed end funds but do not know where to start it is also a perfect investment for investors looking to dollar cost average into without spending too much on monthly purchase trading fees the alternative for those investors is then a uit which will reinvest with no additional fees so would i rush out and buy the fund no not really but i can certainly understand however why someone would for investors with some time and knack for cefs i would simply do some due diligence and select some quality municipal cefs perhaps starting with nvg and nea i hope this update is helpful until the next update keep doing your due diligence more information on this etf is available at the funds website more information about the index can be found here for some muni closed end fund ideas please take a look at my previous article mui investment opportunity for investors on the sidelines nbb build america and your income i

the index  the fund the firm that did a better job at pitching the fund i feel is actually the index sponsor snetwork in their index presentation snetwork does a great job of both pitching the fund and explaining their index methodology below is what the index provider believes are the key features and rationale behind the index they provide for the etf source snet index presentation source snet index presentation source snet index presentation from the above we can sum up the index as that of one seeking tax free income from municipal bonds using leverage to increase returns by investing in multiple funds they can provide diversification in a variety of categories including asset class strategy and management by investing in cefs they may also benefit from buying at discounts to nav looking at how the index is constructed we start with the index eligibility source snet index presentation to be included the cef must be at least  million in market cap and registered in the united states the funds must generally have a  month average daily trading volume of at least k and reasonable fees typically  or less furthermore cefs trading at premiums of more than  are excluded next we look at the weighting methodology source snet index presentation as we can see above the index weights the cefs in the index based on the total net assets of the fund those net assets are then adjusted to reflect either the discount or premium in the price to nav then the funds are capped to  of the index furthermore any funds weighted at over  cannot be more than  combined essentially the index screens out illiquid expensive fee and premium priced cefs and weights the remaining funds based on total fund assets this is the resulting top  holdings in the index source vaneck website so how has it worked so far lets take a look performance we can first take a look at how the etf has performed against the the ishares national muni bond etf nysearcamub and the broader ishares us aggregate bond etf nysearcaagg as we can see much like the municipal cefs we have looked at over the past few articles the fund has performed well ytd being up  on a total return basis compared to a  total return gain for the unlevered ishares etf and  for the us aggregate etf xmpt total return price data by ycharts looking at a  year number however we can see a different picture simply put levered closed end funds were decimated in q  as the fed started raising interest rates xmpt total return price data by ycharts looking at a longer  year time frame we can see the benefits and characteristics of closed end funds namely leverage the vaneck etf is up more than  on a total return basis it is interesting to point out the big rollercoaster from july to december  xmpt total return price data by ycharts for the  year chart i added another set of metrics that is the price per share  change this way you can appreciate and see what percentage of the total return comes from the dividends and income rather than the actual growth in share price once again over the  year time frame xmpt has achieved a total return of over  yet not including the income the price per share is actually down  over the same timeframe mubs price fell only  and achieved a total return of  whereas agg fell  and achieved a total return of  xmpt data by ycharts lastly we can take a look at the funds since inception numbers since inception the fund has done extremely well certainly outperforming the etf competition it has achieved a price per share increase of  and a total return of  compared to  and  for mub and  and  for agg xmpt data by ycharts all great right the question is why not just buy a few good top performing cefs and save on the fees lets take a look at how the etf compares against just holding some of the individual holdings we take a look at xmpt against the nuveen amt free quality muni income fund nea the nuveen amtfree muni credit fund nvg the eaton vance muni bond fund eim and the blackrock muni intermediate duration fund mui as we can see over the ytd number the etf has performed quite well against its peers only second best to the red line representing the nuveen amt free muni fund nvg xmpt total return price data by ycharts the exact same holds true for the  year time frame xmpt total return price data by ycharts  and the  year number xmpt total return price data by ycharts on the  year time frame nearly the same picture is present although the difference in performance is significantly greater and the eaton vance fund outperformed the etf xmpt total return price data by ycharts examining the since inception however the trend resumes with xmpt taking second place again behind nvg xmpt total return price data by ycharts finally i wanted to take a look at how this managed etf does compared to the way i typically looked at diversification in cefs and that is through unit investment trusts or uits one popular sponsor is guggenheim they currently have a  year portfolio maturing this november since november th  the uit has achieved a total return of  the etf has achieved a return of  over the same time period the one thing not considered however is the dividends reinvested where the etf would incur transaction fees if reinvesting the dividend xmpt total return price data by ycharts another popular series of municipal cef uits is the first trust portfolios series one portfolio that i looked at is a  year portfolio launched in august   which is due to mature in about a month over that time frame the portfolio has returned  during the same timeframe xmpt would achieve a total return of  xmpt data by ycharts while it is not definitive i will be looking at this more closely in the future bottom line so bottom line you would of been better off just buying the nuveen amtfree muni credit closed end fund nysemktnvg it is the largest holding in the etf and it has outperformed the etf over every observed time frame the other funds the nuveen funds in particular have performed quite well as well the value of the etf i believe is that it is a  ticket solution to having a basket of muni closed end funds over buying and managing your own basket beyond that the etf will in essence automatically routinely rebalance and reallocate itself possibly saving you ticket charges i am quite sure if you picked a good basket of muni cefs and managed the quarterly rebalancing yourself you would likely come out ahead saving the  bpts fee is this fund solving some massive cef problem no not at all what it is however is a good introductory investment for those looking at closed end funds but do not know where to start it is also a perfect investment for investors looking to dollar cost average into without spending too much on monthly purchase trading fees the alternative for those investors is then a uit which will reinvest with no additional fees so would i rush out and buy the fund no not really but i can certainly understand however why someone would for investors with some time and knack for cefs i would simply do some due diligence and select some quality municipal cefs perhaps starting with nvg and nea i hope this update is helpful until the next update keep doing your due diligence more information on this etf is available at the funds website more information about the
