aperture description crossreference to related applicationsthis application is a continuationinpart of us patent application ser no  filed aug   which is incorporated by reference in its entirety hereinbackground field of the disclosurethe present disclosure relates generally to a product display system such as for displaying merchandise at a retail location description of the backgroundretail merchandise is displayed in many different ways at a retail outlet for example merchandise may be displayed on shelves or in racks the method of displaying the merchandise is often selected in a manner to enhance some consumer perception such as value desirability etcsome methods of displaying merchandise are intended to capitalize on the so called impulse purchase such methods generally include displaying a small number of relatively small sized product units in a location that is both immediately noticeable to the consumer and easily accessible sometimes these displays are placed in a location where a consumer is likely to have to wait for some period of time such as at checkout counters sometimes such displays are located along the general flow of traffic of consumers through a store and prominently displayed in a manner that literally stands apart from the surrounding products such product displays often include a hanging vertical display assembly including an elongate vertical body with multiple product hangers extending from one or both sides of a vertical base strip also frequently known as strip display assembliesstrip display assemblies come in many different forms one common strip display assembly includes an upstanding or hanging generally vertical support panel with a number of product hangers such as hooks or clips that extend from one side of the vertical panel products are hung from the product hangers and a consumer may easily remove one of the products from the strip display assembly by simply lifting it off the hook or removing it from the clip often these strip display assemblies are singlesided meaning that the hooks are disposed on only one side of the support panel such singlesided strip display assemblies however may not maximize the available amount of display space because products can only be displayed on one side of the support panelin order to overcome the limitations of the singlesided strip display assembly other strip display assemblies have been adapted to be twosided wherein product hangers are disposed on front and back sides of a generally vertical support panel such that products may be displayed on both the front and back sides of the strip display assembly rather than on only one side of the support panelstrip display assemblies often include removable product hangers that may be assembled to hang from the support panel in any of the many different locations to provide a more versatile product display system that is adaptable for displaying products of different sizes andor in different arrangements one common type of product display system includes a pair of vertically oriented support panels disposed adjacent each other with a space or gap formed therebetween each support panel includes a plurality of apertures therethrough and each display hanger includes one or more brackets or cleats that can be inserted into various ones of the apertures to releasably mount the product hanger to the support panel the two support panels are spaced apart so that the distal ends of the brackets of one product hanger do not interfere with the distal ends of the brackets of another product hanger when the two product hangers are mounted on opposite sides of the support panels aligned directly opposite with each other some general examples of systems generally similar to this are disclosed in shea us pat no  and in barkdoll us pat no  although versatile this style of strip display assembly often requires some assembly in the field in order to dispose the two support panels in spaced apart relationanother type of strip display assembly dispenses with the need to assemble the two support panels in spaced apart relation by providing only a single support panel that is vertically oriented for example by being hung from a hook display hangers are connected to the vertical panel with cleats that extend through apertures through the support panel display hangers can be hung on either or both of the front side and the back side of the support panel some general examples of systems generally similar to this are disclosed in shea us design pat no d and shae us pat no  however in this arrangement it is not possible to hang two display hangers on both the front and back sides of the vertical panel such that the product hangers are directly opposite or aligned with each other vertically and horizontally rather it is necessary in this type of strip display assembly for one product hanger on one side of the vertical panel to be displaced vertically andor horizontally from the other product hanger on the other side of the vertical panel so that the cleats of the one product hanger do not interfere with the other product hanger this effect can limit the versatility of this type of strip display assemblysummaryaccording to some aspects of the present disclosure a hanger support member is provided that can be used with known product hangers such as traditional pegboard hooks preferably the hanger support member can be used with the traditional pegboard hooks and with other product hangers according to the present disclosurein one exemplary arrangement of the present disclosure a hanger support member for a supporting one or more product hangers such as traditional pegboard hooks has a web defining first and second channels on a first side of the web

channels wherein each aperture in the row extends through the web the web preferably has a corrugated cross section extending between opposite lateral edges of the web and defining the first through fourth channels the first and second channels are preferably alternatingly interspersed with the third and fourth channelsin another aspect of the present disclosure a product display system includes the hanger support member and one or more product hangers adapted to be mounted to the hanger support member with one or more brackets that fit through the receiving apertures the product hangers and the hanger support member are arranged such that two product hangers may be mounted on opposite sides of the hanger support member in the same row of receiving apertures so as to be aligned with each other horizontally and vertically without requiring two vertical support panels with a space therebetween rather when a product hanger is mounted to either side of the hanger support member a space is formed by one or more of the channels between the hanger support member and the product hanger the space is sized or arranged to receive a distal end of the mounting brackets from the other product hanger mounted on the other side of the hanger support member directly opposite the one product hanger when the product hanger is mounted to one side of the web one or more brackets extend through corresponding receiving apertures in the row of apertures and into the channels on the opposite side of the web which are sized to receive the distal ends of the brackets from the product hanger mounted on the opposite side of the hanger support member preferably without extending beyond the surface of the opposite side of the webin further accordance with any one or more of the foregoing exemplary aspects andor arrangements a product display system andor any one more component thereof optionally may include any one or more of the following optional formsin some optional forms the first row of receiving apertures includes a first receiving aperture disposed in the first channel a second receiving aperture disposed in the second channel a third receiving aperture disposed in the

part receiving apertures such as the receiving apertures ad arranged in a rectangular pattern such as a square having one receiving aperture  located at each corner of the rectangle a top pair of the receiving apertures such as the receiving apertures a and b defines a first horizontal row  such as upper row a and a lower pair of the receiving apertures such as the receiving apertures c and d defines a second horizontal row  such as lower row b although the depicted embodiment shows the quadrilateral array  as a rectangular array the quadrilateral array  may alternatively take other shapes including a trapezoidal shape for example with the receiving apertures a b being horizontally spaced apart wider than the receiving apertures c d preferably the quadrilateral array  is symmetrical about some vertical line such as the longitudinal axis of the hanger support member  the upper row a is vertically spaced from the lower row b a first distance or height and each quadrilateral array  is spaced vertically from an adjacent quadrilateral array  a second distance the second distance between adjacent quadrilateral arrays  may be the same as or different than the height of each quadrilateral array  in the exemplary arrangement the hanger support member  is shown with two quadrilateral arrays  thereby defining four vertically spaced apart horizontal rows  however additional rows  andor arrays  may be provided andor the length of the hanger support member  between the top end  and the bottom end  may be increasedturning again to the product hanger  the body  is in the form of a plate which is preferably flat on each of the outboard and inboard sides   the product support member  in this exemplary arrangement is in the form of a hook having a first end connected to the outboard side  and an upturned distal end spaced from the outboard side  however the product support member  may take other forms such as a cleat bracket or other support structures not shown arranged to support one or more pieces of merchandise the product support member  may include or be in the form of a clip in any arrangement the product support member  is arranged to support one or more units of merchandise such as packets bags clusters individual items or other units of merchandiseeach bracket  includes a shaft  and a head  the shaft  has a first end connected to the inboard side  of the body  and extends out from the inboard side  toward the distal end  the head  is wider than the shaft  in the horizontal direction that is the shaft  has a first horizontal width and the head  has a second horizontal width that is wider than the first horizontal width the shaft  and the head  form a flat horizontal plate wherein each of the shaft  and the head  has a horizontally aligned planer shape that is arranged to fit into the horizontal slot of the upper section  in each receiving aperture  the head  is sized to fit through the upper section  but not through the lower section  thus the horizontal width of the head  is approximately equal to or slightly less than the horizontal width of the upper section  and wider than the horizontal width of the lower section  the shaft  is sized also to fit into the lower section  the head  is disposed at the distal end  of the bracket  the head  is spaced apart from the inboard side  of the body  a distance equal to at least the sum of the width of the space  and the width of the web  in this arrangement the head  of each bracket  can first slide into and through the upper section  of a corresponding aperture  from one side of the web  then the shaft  can slide downwardly into the lower section  such that the head  engages the other side of the web  and prevents the product hanger  from disengaging from the web  while the shaft  is disposed through the lower section preferably an upper end of the lower section  has a constricted neck for example formed by a pair of opposing projections  disposed on opposite sides of the lower section  that is narrower than the remaining portions of the lower section  the projections  are spaced apart a width sufficient to form an interference fit with the shaft and to allow the shaft  to resiliently slide through the constricted neck thereby forming a snapfit locking arrangement for the shaft  to prevent the neck  from accidentally slipping out of the lower section  optionally the shaft  may have a tapered crosssection along the side edges rather than a rectangular crosssection to help guide the shaft into the constricted neck from the upper section  and to help the shaft  resiliently snap past the projections in the exemplary arrangement depicted in figs  and a the brackets a and b are spaced apart diagonally on the body  of each product hanger  the bracket a is vertically displaced or offset above the bracket b and each of the brackets a and b are horizontally spaced apart preferably symmetrically on opposite sides of a vertical center line of the inboard side  of the product hanger  the brackets a and b are arranged to engage opposite diagonal receiving apertures a c or b d in any one of the quadrilateral arrays  thus as illustrated in fig  relative to the product hanger a bracket a is arranged to fit into the upper left receiving aperture a and bracket b is arranged to fit into the lower right receiving aperture c in any one of the quadrilateral arrays  when mounted on or from the first side  of the web  similarly when the product hanger b is mounted on the second side  of the web  the brackets a and b fit into the opposite diagonal receiving apertures b and d respectively of any one of the quadrilateral arrays optionally some or all of the rows  on a web  are spaced apart the same height whereby the height of each quadrilateral array  is equal to the distance between each adjacent pair of quadrilateral arrays in this arrangement the brackets a b of any one product hanger  may also fit into diagonally adjacent receiving apertures in two adjacent quadrilateral arrays to releasably mount the product hanger  onto the hanger support member  the brackets a and b are inserted into respective opposite diagonal receiving apertures such as receiving apertures a c if mounted on the first side  of the web  or receiving apertures b d if mounted on the second side  of the web  the inboard side  of the body  engages distal ends of the spacer flanges   thereby forming the space  in the form of a gap between the inboard side  and the web  the space  is sized to receive the head  of each bracket  completely therein thus as best seen in fig a a first product hanger  can be mounted onto the first side  of the web  and a second product hanger  can be mounted onto the second side  of the web  directly opposite the first product hanger  both horizontally and vertically aligned therewith in this arrangement the head  of each bracket  mounted on one side of the web  is disposed in the space  on the other side of the web  formed between the web  and the body  of the opposite product hanger  on the other side of the web  thus in this arrangement two product hangers  can be attached directly opposite each other in vertical and horizontal alignment on opposite sides of the web  without requiring a second web with a space between two webs as in the prior artthe lower hanger support member b may be hung below the upper hanger support member a to extend the vertical length of the product display system  the top end  of the lower hanger support member b may be attached to the bottom end  of the upper hanger support member a by any sufficient mechanism such as a hook or clip  in one exemplary arrangement the lower hanger support member b can be hung from the upper hanger support member a by one or two product hangers a andor b for example the upper bracket a of the product hanger a can be inserted into a lower or bottom receiving aperture  at the bottom end  of the upper hanger support member a and the lower bracket b is inserted into a diagonally opposite upper or a top receiving aperture  at the top end  of the lower hanger support member b optionally the second product hanger b may be mounted onto the opposite sides of the webs  of the upper and lower hanger support members a b in a similar manner with the brackets a b mounted through the opposite diagonal receiving apertures  at the bottom end  and top end  of the upper and lower hanger support members a b respectivelyeach product hanger  optionally includes a pair of guide flanges   disposed along opposite lateral edges   respectively of the body  each guide flange   preferably extends from a top end of the body  to a bottom end of the body  along the respective lateral edge   however the guide flanges   may take other forms consistent with the functionality described herein the guide flanges   are spaced apart laterally sufficient to engage the spacer flanges   such as to be disposed along the outer surfaces of the spacer flanges   when the brackets a b are inserted into receiving apertures  as described previously herein preferably an inner surface of each guide flange   slidably engages an opposing outer surface of the respective spacer flange   in this manner the guide flanges   may help to guide the brackets a b into the appropriate receiving apertures  the guide flanges   may provide additional lateral stability for the product hangers  for example to prevent twisting of the product hangers  when hung on the hanger support member in some arrangements the guide flanges   may be offset inwardly between the spacer flanges   rather than being spaced outwardly from the spacer flanges   in such an arrangement the guide flanges   may also or alternatively serve as spacers to maintain the space  between the body  and the web  sufficient to receive the heads  of the brackets  as described previouslythe guide flanges   are sized andor arranged such that two product hangers  may be mounted directly opposite each other on opposite sides   of the web  and the distal ends of the guide flanges   on the opposing product hangers  will either fit tightly against each other or will be slightly spaced apart so as to not interfere or prevent the product hangers  from being secured to the web  as previously described each guide flange   is not longer than approximately half the length of the spacer flanges   andor the depth of the distal end of the spacer flanges   to the center of the web as shown in fig  a hanging assembly  is optionally disposed at or near the top end  of the web  the hanging assembly  includes one or both of a hanger receiver  such as an aperture extending through the web  and a hanger  such as a hook as exemplified in the drawings other forms of hanging assemblies  may be used that would be sufficient to hang the hanger support member  from some support member such as a rod or bracket a second aperture  may be disposed near the bottom end  of the web  and arranged to receive for example another hanger  such as a hook carried as part of a hanging assembly  in the lower support member b figs  and a show another example arrangement of the product display system  which is similar to the example product display system shown in figs  and a like the previous example the product display system  includes a hanger support member  and one or more product hangers  such as product hangers a and b that can be releasably mounted on opposite sides   of the web  the hanger support member  includes a vertically oriented web  extending between a top end  and a bottom end  a plurality of receiving apertures  extending through the web  and spacer flanges   disposed along opposite lateral left and right side edges   of the web  each product hanger  includes a body  in the form of a flat plate a product support member  in the form of a hook extending from an outboard side  of the body  and a pair of brackets a b extending from an inboard side  of the body  each product hanger  also includes a pair of guide flanges   disposed along opposite lateral edges   of the body  and extending in the same direction as the brackets  the product hanger  can be releasably mounted onto either or both of the first and second sides   of the web by inserting the brackets a b into corresponding ones of the receiving apertures  further two product hangers  can be releasably mounted simultaneously aligned directly opposite each other on opposite sides  and unlike the product display system in figs  and a however the receiving apertures  are arranged in a plurality of vertically spaced apart linear arrays such as horizontal rows  wherein each row  includes four horizontal spaced apart receiving apertures a b c d preferably the receiving apertures ad in each row  are spaced apart evenly and horizontally symmetric about a vertical centerline along the axis of the web  with first and second apertures a and b on the left side of the vertical center line and third and fourth apertures c and d disposed on the right side of the vertical center line as seen in fig  each row  of apertures ad may be vertically spaced from the adjacent rows  a distance equal to the horizontal distance between opposite ends of the row  or a different spacingalso different the brackets a b on each product hanger  are aligned horizontally and offset asymmetrically left or right between the guide flanges   from a vertical center line of the body  the brackets a and b are arranged on the product hanger  to fit into and through the receiving apertures b and d respectively if mounted onto the first side  of the web and to fit into and through receiving apertures c and a respectively if mounted onto the second side  of the web  as best seen in fig a as with the exemplary arrangement of figs  and a each receiving aperture  has an upper section  and a lower section  wherein the upper section  is wider than the lower section  in exemplary arrangement of figs  and a each receiving aperture  has the shape generally of a key hole wherein the upper section  has a generally circular shape with a first diameter and the lower section  is in the form of a vertically oriented slot extending downwardly from the upper section  with a width that is less than the diameter of the upper section  preferably an upper end of the lower section  has a constricted neck for example formed by a pair of opposing projections  disposed on opposite sides of the lower section  that is narrower than the remaining portions of the lower section  the projections  are spaced apart a width sufficient to form an interference fit with the shaft  and to allow the shaft  to resiliently slide through the constricted neck thereby forming a snapfit locking arrangement for the shaft  to prevent the neck  from accidentally slipping out of the lower section  thus the head  of each bracket  can fit through the upper section  but not through the lower section  while the shaft  can slide down into the lower section  with a snapfit locking action past the projections  preferably the head  is generally circular shaped having a diameter complementary to the shape just slightly less than the diameter of the upper section  and the shaft  has a generally cylindrical shape with a diameter just slightly less than the width of the lower section  and slightly larger than the space between the opposing projections in this arrangement unlike the previous example arrangement two product hangers  may be simultaneously mounted in alignment to the opposite sides   of the web  and the brackets ab of one product hanger  fit into receiving apertures a c of a row  while the brackets ab of the other product hanger  fit into receiving apertures b d of the same row  as best seen in fig athe remaining portions of the example product display system  shown in figs  and a are substantially similar in form and function as described with regard to the arrangement shown in figs  and a the reader is therefore referred to the detailed description of the same features provided previously hereinfig  shows another exemplary arrangement of the product display system  wherein the guide flanges  and  on each product hanger  are spaced apart a distance less than the distance between the spacer flanges  and  as a result the guide flanges  and  are disposed between the spacer flanges  and  when the product hanger  is mounted to the hanger support member  optionally the guide flanges   are aligned inwardly from the spacer flanges   and arranged to slidingly engage the inner surfaces of the spacer flanges   in this arrangement the guide flanges   also function as the spacers that maintain the space  between the body  of the product hanger and the web  of the hanger support member  for receiving the heads  of the brackets fig  shows another optional feature for the display system  including one or more graphics support surfaces such as a graphics support flange  extending laterally outwardly from the hanger support member  the graphics support flange  has a first end  connected to the exterior side of the spacer flange  opposite the web  a second distal end  spaced away from the spacer flange  and opposite first and second sides   the flange  is preferably axially aligned with the web  graphics such as printing stickers andor laminates with words andor pictures may be carried on at least the first andor second sides   in some arrangements the graphics support flange  has a length between the first and second ends   of between approximately one inch  cm and twelve inches  cm although other lengths may be used depending on the anticipated use size andor scale of the product display system  andor graphics another optional graphics support surface includes one or more extensions  of the spacer flanges  andor  of which only exemplary extensions a and b on spacer flange  are shown each extension  preferably extends beyond the body  when a product hanger  is mounted to the same side of the web  for example a distance of one to twelve inches  cm cm the extensions a b are preferably aligned with and extensions of the opposite distal ends of the flange  the extensions a b may extend the entire length of the flange  from the top end  to the bottom end  or may be less than the entire length or be intermittent along the length of the flange  like the flange  graphics may be carried by at least either or both sides of the extensions a b remaining numbered features of the exemplary product display system  shown in fig  are substantially the same in form and function as the same numbered features in the exemplary embodiments of figs  andor  the reader is therefore referred to the detailed description of the same features provided previously hereinturning now to figs  to b another exemplary product display system  is shown in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure the product display system  includes a hanger support member  and one or more product hangers such as product hangers a b and product hangers a and b adapted to be mounted onto the hanger support member  as described in more detail hereafter the product support member  is particularly well suited for use with product hangers according to the teaching of the present disclosure andor with product hangers already known in the art such as traditional plastic pegboard hooks and traditional wire pegboard hooksthe hanger support member  includes a web  having opposite first and second sides   extending along an axis x from a first end  to a second end  first and second channels   are recessed into the first side  third and fourth channels   are recessed into the second side  each of the first through fourth channels     extends along the axis of the web  from the first end  to the second end  preferably the web  has a corrugated or lateral profile defining the first through fourth channels  also preferably the corrugated profile has a constant thickness between the first and second sides   extending from a first lateral edge of the web  to a second lateral edge  of the web in some arrangements the corrugated profile extends from the first end  to the second end  of the web  in other arrangements the corrugated profile is interrupted between the first and second ends   of the web  each of the first through fourth channels  is parallel with the axis of the web the first and second channels  and  are alternatingly interspersed with the third and fourth channels  and  whereby the first channel  is adjacent or proximate the second lateral edge  of the web  the third channel  is disposed adjacent or proximate the first lateral edge  the second channel  is disposed between the third channel  and the fourth channel  and the fourth channel  is disposed between the first channel  and the second channel  said another way the first and second channels   are interleaved or interlaced with the third and fourth channels   one or both of the side walls of each channel also form a sidewall of one or both adjacent channels although the exemplary hanger support member  includes four channels  additional or fewer channels may be used in other arrangementsone or more receiving apertures  extend through the web  from the first side  to the second side  the receiving apertures  are arranged in at least one and preferably a plurality of rows  extending laterally across the web  and across each of the first through fourth channels  each row  includes a first receiving aperture a disposed in the first channel  a second receiving aperture b disposed in the second channel  a third receiving aperture c disposed in the third channel  and a fourth receiving aperture d disposed in the fourth channel  any number of rows  of receiving apertures  may be disposed along the axis of the web  each row  is spaced axially from adjacent rows  along the web the product hangers a b are similar to those described previously herein with reference to figs  a and  the product hangers a b are in the form of traditional plastic pegboard hooks each product hanger a b includes a body  having an outboard side  an inboard side  two mounting brackets such as the brackets a b in the form of upturned hooks disposed on the inboard side  and a product support member  such as a hook or clip disposed on the outboard side  of the body  each product hanger a and b can be mounted on either of the first or second sides   of the web  at any one of the given rows  of receiving apertures  for example in any given row  the product hanger a may be mounted to the first side  of the web  by placing the bracket a through the fourth receiving aperture d and placing the bracket b through the third receiving aperture c in this position as shown in fig b the distal ends of the brackets a b are disposed within the channels  and  respectively on the opposite second side  of the web  similarly the product support member b may be simultaneously mounted to the second side  of the web  in the same row  of receiving apertures  by inserting the bracket a into the second receiving aperture b and inserting the bracket b into the first receiving aperture a with the distal ends of the brackets a and b received within the channels  and  respectively on the first side  of the web  as can best seen in figs a and b when a product hanger a b a b is mounted on one side of the web  the distal ends of the brackets a b a b are disposed in spaces formed by the respective channels   between the web  and the body  or  of a product hanger a b a b mounted on the opposite side of the web  thus two product hangers such as a and b or a and b may be mounted to opposite sides of the web  axially and laterally aligned with each other in a single row  of apertures a first flange  is disposed along the first lateral edge  of the web  a second flange  is disposed along the second lateral edge  of the web  each flange   extends the entire axial length of the web  from the first end  to the second end  the flanges   may function to provide both stiffness to the web  so as to minimize unwanted flexing of the web andor to act as spacers as described previously with respect to the hanger support member  the flanges   are spaced apart laterally a distance sufficient to allow each of the product hangers a b to be mounted onto the web  between the flanges   as best seen in fig b thus the web  has a width from the first lateral edge  to the second lateral edge  that is as large as or larger than the width of the body  in this manner the product hanger a or b may be mounted flat onto either of the sides   of the web  between the webs  and  in other arrangements one or both of the flanges  and  may be omitted andor sized differentlyas also seen in figs a and b the distal ends of the flanges   extend outwardly past the respective first and second sides   of the web  in this arrangement the flanges  and  may also act as spacers for mounting the product hangers a b shown in fig a to the hanger support member  in a manner as previously described herein in relation to the product display system as further seen in figs a and b the channels  in the web  are sized and arranged such that the distal ends of the mounting brackets of a product hanger  or  mounted on one side of the web  will not extend beyond andor will be recessed within the respective channels behind the outermost surface of the opposite side of the webas mentioned above the hanger support member  in one arrangement has a constant lateral profile extending along all or a majority of the length of the web  between the first end  and the second end  this may be useful for ease of manufacturing for example by extrusion however a flattened portion  shown in fig  can also be formed in the web  for example adjacent the first end  and include an aperture  suitable for receiving a hanger  as described previously herein the flattened portion  is disposed in a central portion of the web  between the first and second lateral edges   the flattened portion  extends laterally across a portion of each of the second channel  and the third channel  and preferably has the shape of a rectangle a flattened portion  may be formed at either or both of the ends   of the web  as shown in fig  however in other arrangements the aperture  may be formed in any one of the channels  through  or in a side wall of any one of the channels or the flattened portion  may extend across a larger portion of the web  such as extending completely from the first lateral edge  to the second lateral edge  the flattened portion  may be formed for example by pressing the web  after extrusion or the hanger support member  may be formed by molding rather than extrusion other methods of forming the hanger support member  may also be possible and used as desiredthe apertures  may have any shape or outline as necessary or desired to cooperate with any one or more given brackets andor bracket designs on a given product hanger in figs  the receiving apertures  as an example have a circular shape adapted for receiving a circular head on the distal ends of the brackets of the product hangers  and  in other arrangements as shown in the top row  of fig  each receiving aperture  may have a keyhole shape including an upper portion having circular shape elongate circular shape or an oval shape and an elongate slot shown in dashed lines extending downwardly from the upper portion other shapes and arrangements of various types of receiving apertures  may also be used according to the teachings of the present disclosure such as those discussed above in reference to figs  and  for examplethe product support member  may be formed of any material sufficient to support one or more product hangers and products as described herein in some arrangements the hanger support member  is formed of plastic metal wood cardboard paper or other similar materialsas shown in figs b the product support member  advantageously in many arrangements can be used to support different configurations of product hangers such as the product hangers  and the product hangers  at the same timethe product support member  may include more than four channels in some arrangements the product support member  may be in the form of large sheet such as for hanging on a wall or in a product rack in this arrangement the product support member  may have for example any number more than four of vertically aligned channels alternating on the front and rear sides of the sheet such as the channels  across up to the entire width of the sheetthe product display systems  and  disclosed herein may be useful for displaying products such as merchandise in a retail location such as a store in some exemplary aspects the product display systems  and  can be manufactured simply and costeffectively by injection molding andor extruding the parts from plastic andor forming the parts from metal the product display system is easy to assemble and when broken down may be very

maastricht university in the netherlands an endowed chair jointly sponsored by forensic psychiatric center ‘de rooyse wissel’ his work is also supported by the expertise center for forensic psychiatry efp at maastricht university david bernstein leads the forensic psychology section which is embedded within the department of clinical psychological science this section has an outstanding academic reputation and is internationally renowned for its research on psychology and law related topics and excellent teaching program including the international masters program in forensic psychology david bernstein has served as president of the association for research on personality disorders vice president of the international society for the study of personality disorders and vice president of the international society for schema therapy before coming to the netherlands david bernstein had already conducted research on personality disorders for twenty years in for example his position as associate professor in the department of psychology at fordham university new york where he was a codirector of the forensic psychology program david bernstein was trained by dr jeffrey young and colleagues to be a schemafocused therapist and has extensively supervised given workshops and written on schema therapy st which is an integrative approach for personality disorders and treatmentresistant patients in  david bernstein came to the netherlands with the intention to conduct research on the effectiveness of st in individuals with personality disorders around that time research on the effectiveness of this therapy form was already being conducted by arnoud arntz josephine giesenbloo and colleagues showing st to be effective in treating nonforensic outpatients with borderline personality disorder because of a great need for better treatment for forensic patients who often suffer from personality disorders eg antisocial personality disorder david bernstein and his colleagues adapted the st approach to meet the challenges posed by this population eg aggression and callousness subsequently david bernstein initiated a large randomized clinical trial rct testing the effectiveness of st in comparison to regular treatment ‘treatment as usual’ for forensic patients with cluster b personality disorders in seven ‘tbs’ institutions in the netherlands forensic psychiatric clinics de rooyse wissel van der hoeven oostvaarders mesdag veldzicht kijvelanden and fpk assen in dutch tbs stands for ‘terbeschikkingstelling’ which may be translated as ‘placed at the disposal’ of the government in one of the specialized institutions for forensic psychiatric care david bernstein’s major areas of research interest are personality disorders psychological trauma and forensic issues his academic achievements include over  peerreviewed articles and book chapters on these topics grants invited presentations at international meetings and service as a journal editor and reviewer he is also author of the childhood trauma questionnaire a widely used selfreport measure of child abuse and neglect recently david bernstein coproduced a dvd series on how
