ratio – defined as the percentage of performing loans trading below  – can often paint a clearer pict ure about the path of forward default probabilities through december the ratio was  only  traded below  a level considered to be higher in default risk overall we believe defaults are likely to grind modestly higher in the coming year bu t remain low and below average in an historical context this view aligns with the latest splcd quarterly survey of loan managers with the latest poll showing that participants have cut forecasts of nearterm loan defaults though the current credit c ycle may indeed be in its later innings decent economic data now and the potential for supportive trumpera policies ahead should shift default risk from the nearer term to something further out market

quarterpoint rate hikes with month libor at the average floor in the loan market and month libor at  the higher income potential that may follow the next fed rate hike will likely continue to draw investor attention looking ahead we believe the markets technical ba lance remains tipped toward one of strength and we think its likely that asset class buyership grows as investors brace for the
