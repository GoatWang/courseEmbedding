almaulainternational partnershipsdr almaula previously worked in the recombinant protein division of dnax research institute now about codiagnostics incthe codiagnostics value propositioncodiagnostics’ codx™ portfolio of molecular diagnostics development products and tests represents a radical new advancement in the understanding of the molecular interactions of dna  leading a global health revolution through mathematical innovations cost reductions and wider margins with our shareholders in mindusing highly specialized proprietary cooperativetheory mathematicsleading to a revolutionary leap forward in the extraction of infectious diseases genetic disorders and other conditionsat a fraction of the cost of other dnabased testsdesigned for a new generation of affordable mobile pointofcare diagnostic devices and compatible with many other existing commerciallyavailable devicesmaking stateoftheart diagnostics available anywhere in the world including developing countries the company         codiagnostics inc “company” “cdi” a utah c corporation headquartered in sandy utah is a molecular diagnostics company that develops manufactures and markets a new stateoftheart diagnostics technology using unique mathematical models instead of relying on costly laboratory infrastructure the company has created a revolutionary new dnabased testing platform resulting in tests that arefaster cdi’s system has created a new generation of realtime pcr dna testing  development time is dramatically reduced to weeks instead of months or even yearsaffordable much lowerpriced tests – a fraction of competitors’ pricing – due to far less test development time lower cost of goods and no rd party royalties paidflexible the system is compatible with many vendors’ dna diagnostic testing machines it is particularly wellsuited to a new generation of smaller more portable analysis machinery for field clinic and hospital environmentsaccurate tests are more specific and sensitive than competitors’ detect even a single virus regardless of sample size and are designed to detect multiple strains of bacterial and viral infections from all over the worlda powerhouse combination  working in tandem both affordable tests and affordable mobile diagnostic devices will revolutionize dna diagnostics for the first time making accurate detection of genetic disorders and infectious diseases far less expensive and much more broadly available this is made possible by combining proprietary software patented reagent technologies and an array of affordable accurate pcr teststhe codiagnostics difference – it’s in the math  dr brent satterfield invented the company’s suite of intellectual properties cdi scientists were the first to understand the complex mathematics of dna test design to “engineer” a dna test and to automate algorithms that rapidly screen millions of possible options to pinpoint the optimum design this bioengineering

cik  we estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately  at an initial public offering price of  per share after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately  we expect the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to fund our operations for up to  months assuming no revenues from sales of our tests following the closing of the offering including the completion of our planned expansion of the number of tests we will offer to the public we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows   for development of tests expansion of laboratory facilities and clinical and infield validation for regulatory filings of diagnostic tests   to increase our sales and marketing capabilities   to expand the availability of pcr machines in developing nations under a reagent rental program and   to fund our share of the manufacturing facility to produce our reagents in india and other locations in the developing world and  approximately  of the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including working capital this expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the status of and results from clinical trials of and acceptance of our full menu of diagnostic tests as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering we may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments including shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing instruments and us government securities the molecular diagnostics industry is extremely competitive there are many firms that provide some or all of the products we provide and provide many diagnostic tests that we have yet to develop many of these competitors are larger than us and have significantly greater financial resources because we are not established many of our competitors have a competitive advantage in the diagnostic testing industry because they also have other lines of business in the pharmaceutical industry from which they derive revenues and for which they are well known and respected in the medical profession we will need to overcome the disadvantage of being a start up with no history of success and no respect of the medical and testing professionals in the diagnostic testing industry we compete with such companies as biomerieux siemans qiagen and cephied and with such pharmaceutical companies as abbott laboratories becton dickinson and johnson and johnson many of these competitors already have an established customer base with industry standard technology which we must overcome to be successful company description codiagnostics inc “cdi” a utah corporation is a molecular diagnostics company that has developed and intends to manufacture and sell reagents used for diagnostic tests that function via the detection andor analysis of nucleic acid molecules dna or rna and to sell diagnostic equipment from other manufacturers as selfcontained lab systems which we refer to as the “mdx device” dr brent satterfield our chief technology officer created the company’s suite of intellectual properties our scientists were among the first to understand the complex mathematics of dna test design to “engineer” a dna test and to automate algorithms that rapidly screen millions of possible options to pinpoint the optimum design dr satterfield developed the company’s intellectual property consisting of the predictive mathematical algorithms and proprietary reagents used in the testing process which together represent a major advance in polymerase chain reaction “pcr” testing systems cdi technologies are now protected by five granted or pending us patents as well as certain trade secrets our platform allows us to avoid paying existing patent royalties required by other pcr test systems which has the potential of allowing cdi to sell diagnostic labs and tests at a lower cost than competitors while generating a profit margin we will either sell or lease our portable labs to existing diagnostic centers through sale or lease agreements and sell the reagents that comprise our proprietary tests cdi’s lowcost system uses cdi’s tests to diagnose tuberculosis zika hepatitis b and c malaria dengue and hiv all of which tests have been designed and verified in cdi’s laboratory we designed our tests by identifying the optimal locations on the target gene for nucleic acid amplification and paired the location with the optimized primer and probe structure to achieve outputs that meet the design input requirements identified from market research this is done by following planned and documented processes procedures and testing in other words the data resulting from our tests verify that we succeeded in designing what we intended to at the outset verification is a series of testing that concludes that the product is ready to proceed to validation in a clinical performance evaluation setting using initial production tests to confirm that the product as designed meets the user needs cdi’s diagnostics systems enable very rapid lowcost sophisticated molecular testing for organisms and genetic diseases by greatly automating historically complex procedures in both the development and administration of tests cdi’s newest technical advance involves a novel approach to pcr test design coprimers that eliminates one of the key vexing issues of pcr amplification the exponential growth of primerdimer pairs false positives and false negatives which adversely interferes with identification of the target dnarna using its proprietary test design system and proprietary reagents cdi will design and sell pcr diagnostic tests for diseases and pathogens starting with tests for tuberculosis drug resistant tuberculosis hepatitis b and c malaria dengue hiv and zika virus all of which tests have been designed and verified in cdi’s laboratory product offering we plan to manufacture molecular diagnostic kits for the following tests in the following regions to be sold along with the mdx device timetable region tests current revenues in the caribbean and central zika tuberculosis nd quarter in  and south america hepatitis b and c dengue india tuberculosis hepatitis b and c malaria

grenada haiti guyana jamaica montserrat saint kitts and nevis saint lucia st maarten saint vincent and the grenadines suriname trinidad and tobago turks and caicos islands in some of these countries there are no regulatory hurdles and we can start offering our tests immediately the us food and drug administration fda has granted permission for us to export many of our products the fdas permission to export was granted under section  e of the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended the “fdc act” section e of the fda act covers certain medical devices that have not yet received an approved premarket approval in the united states by the fda such as our products we have not commenced any premarket approval steps with the fda section e applies to medical devices that are acceptable to the importing country and that are manufactured under the fdas good manufacturing practices we will first offer our zika test in this region because of the demand for such test followed quickly by tests for tuberculosis hepatitis b and c and dengue then our full range of tests products will be manufactured for sale upon receipt of purchase orders from labs and hospitals india the company has entered into an agreement to manufacture diagnostics tests for seven infectious diseases with a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in india the agreement provides for the manufacture of the tests named above and the joint sales and marketing of those tests in india since the tests will be conducted in india on indian citizens no fda approval or inspection will be required certain indian regulatory approval from the central drugs standard control organization cdsco must be acquired we are engaging the services of an experienced consultant in india to help get us through this process research use only ruo reagents are able to be sold without requiring regulatory approval as long as they are labeled and designated as such we are beginning to sell these products in india in  india is the country with the highest burden of tuberculosis world health organization who tuberculosis statistics for india for  give an estimated incidence figure of  million cases of tuberculosis for india out of a global incidence of  million the tuberculosis incidence for india is the number of new cases of active tuberculosis disease in india during a certain time period usually a year europe molecular diagnostics such as our tests are governed in europe by the framework for in vitro diagnostics ivds which encompasses diagnostic products such as reagents instruments and systems intended for use in diagnosis of disease the regulatory system for ivds is built largely on a selfcertification procedure placing heavy responsibility on manufacturers non selfcertified products are subject to the same standards as selfcertified products but are subject to audit and review by a notified body prior to receiving approval to be cemarked a cemarking is a manufacturer’s declaration that a product meets the requirements of the applicable european commission directive examples of current obligations include having in place a qualitative manufacturing process user instructions that are clear and fit for purpose ensuring that the ‘physical’ features of devices and diagnostics do not pose any danger if a product fulfils these and other related control requirements it may be cemarked as an indication that the product is compliant with eu legislation and sold in the european union we have received iso  and iso  certifications relating to the design and manufacture of our medical device products the iso certification indicates that we meet the standards required to selfcertify certain of our products and affix a cemarking for sales of our products in countries accepting the ce marking not in the united states with only minimal further governmental approvals in each country we expect to have our zika and tuberculosis tests cemarked in  we estimate the remaining costs for cemarks to be approximately  united states we do not anticipate offering our tests in the united states in the near future we believe however our tests may be able to qualify as laboratory developed tests ldts diagnostic tests that are developed and manufactured by clia certified laboratories these tests are developed by the lab for use only in that laboratory clia laboratories develop the performance characteristics perform the analytical validation for their ldts and obtain licenses to offer them as diagnostic services the fda has publicly announced its intention to regulate certain ldts in a phasedin approach but draft guidance that was published a couple of years ago was withdrawn at the end of the obama administration and replaced by an informal nonenforceable discussion paper
