invention generally relates to data acquisition and generation more particularly the invention concerns a method and apparatus to obtain display and manipulate vehicle data obtained from a vehicle network background of the invention  modern vehicles contain several onboard computers that are responsible for the operation and regulation of many systems such as the engine ignition system the cruise control system and the antilock brake system to name but a few the vehicle computers rely upon multiple sensors to operate the various vehicle systems these sensors monitor a host of vehicle functions such as engine ignition timing engine coolant temperature wheel speed and other functions generally all of the vehicles sensors are interconnected by a wired or wireless network if a problem arises one or more sensors will report through the network to at least one computer and one of the computers will usually generate a diagnostic trouble code “dtc” error message  included within the vehicles computer network is an onboard diagnostic system that stores these dtcs for later review by a mechanic onboard diagnostic systems were first installed by vehicle manufacturers in the s generally onboard diagnostic obd systems monitor control and record various vehicle systems and components in  congress amended the clean air act to require the environmental protection agency to mandate and regulate installation of obd systems in all new vehicles subchapter ii of the clean air act vests in the federal government the almost exclusive responsibility for establishing guidelines for obd systems one state california is permitted to establish its own obd system regulations as vehicle designs evolve so have obd system requirements  today the obd system standard is obdii virtually all vehicles built since  have this obd system and most vehicle manufactures use one of three computer communication protocols to enable the transfer of dtcs and other vehicle data from the obdii system to a scan tool or console the scan tool connects to the obdii system through a federally mandated standardized connector plug that is easily accessible from the passenger compartment  most vehicle owners become aware of the obd system when their “check engine light” display appears on their dashboard the automobile service industry calls the check engine light a “mil” or malfunction indicator light to determine what has caused the mil a mechanic attaches a scan tool to the obd connector which displays obd data scan tools can range from a simple handheld meter that provides a simple readout of the various sensor data or signals up to a large console unit costing thousands of dollars these scan tools or consoles are generally compatible with most obd equipped vehicles and contain software that enables the display of data received from the vehicles obd system  because of their investment in this equipment most service shops charge a fee to attach a scanning tool and diagnose the problem that set the mil however with the introduction of more economical and userfriendly scan tools it is now practicable for the home mechanic and small shop technician to access the obd system these scan tools vary widely in the amount and type of data that they can read with some showing just the basic obd signals and others showing the full range of obd service codes  while the vast number amateur home mechanics only wish to find out why their check engine light is on many others want to learn more about their vehicles performance however none of the available scan tools manipulate the data available from the obd system to obtain vehicle performance instead conventional scan tools simply display data downloaded from the vehicles obd system  therefore there exists a need for a device that can display vehicle data obtained from a vehicle network as well as manipulate the data to provide additional vehicle information for the mechanic or vehicle enthusiast summary of the invention  in order to overcome the deficiencies with known conventional scan tools a system method and article of manufacture to obtain and display vehicle data is provided briefly the vehicle data display system of the present invention communicates with a vehicle network through a connector located in the vehicle passenger compartment and displays and manipulates the data obtained from the vehicle network  more specifically one embodiment of the present invention comprises a computer program product for directing a general purpose digital computer to obtain specific vehicle data from the vehicle network and manipulate the data to obtain a vehicle power the vehicle power represents a power that is generated at a driving wheel of the vehicle thereby allowing an enthusiast or technician to obtain a power value that represents the power delivered to the vehicles driving wheels  another embodiment of the present invention comprises a computer program product for directing a general purposes digital computer to obtain data from a vehicle network and manipulate the data to obtain a vehicle torque the vehicle torque represents a torque generated by the vehicles engine another embodiment of the present invention comprises a computer program product for directing a general purpose digital computer to obtain data from a vehicle network and generate a vehicle fuel economy other embodiments of the present invention can use data obtained from a vehicle network to obtain acceleration times over a distance established by a user of the general purpose digital computer as well as specific distances such as a quarter mile  these and other features and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated from review of the following detailed description of the invention along with the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughoutbrief description of the drawings  fig  is a schematic diagram of a vehicle data

constructed according to the present invention it will be recognized that some or all of the figures are schematic representations for purposes of illustration and do not necessarily depict the actual relative sizes or locations of the elements shown detailed description of the invention  in the following paragraphs the present invention will be described in detail by way of example with reference to the attached drawings throughout this description the preferred embodiment and examples shown should be considered as exemplars rather than as limitations on the present invention as used herein the “present invention” refers to any one of the embodiments of the invention described herein and any equivalents furthermore reference to various features of the “present invention” throughout this document does not mean that all claimed embodiments or methods must include the referenced features  modern vehicles contain several onboard computer processors modules sensors and other components that are responsible for the operation and regulation of many vehicle systems generally these devices are interconnected by a vehicle network most vehicle networks also include an onboard diagnostic system obd obd systems are in most cars and light trucks on the road today through the years the vehicle network and the obd system have become more sophisticated  one embodiment to the present invention obtains and manipulates vehicle data from a vehicle network through a connector located in the vehicle passenger compartment a preferred embodiment of the present invention obtains the vehicle data through an obd connector  as defined herein a “vehicle network” is a group of points or nodes connected by communication paths generally these points or nodes in a vehicle represent modules sensors or computer processors these various devices may be joined by a single wire or multiple wires and may be included within one or more discreetly wired networks that either communicate or do not communicate with each other a vehicle network as defined herein may comprise in whole or in part an obd system employing an sae j communication protocol an iso  communication protocol or an iso  communication protocol also known as an iso  carb a vehicle network as defined herein may also employ an iso  standard or a kwp  standard a vehicle network as defined herein may also comprise a controller area network can the can may use iso  iso  or other protocols for example a vehicle network as defined herein may employ a single wire can that uses an sae j communication standard a j standard generally found on heavy trucks and buses a j communication standard or other standards yet to be developed for example the vehicle network as defined herein may also employ architectures and communication protocol standards yet to be developed such as an intelligent transportation systems data bus idb or an obdiii or an obdiv standard a vehicle network as defined herein may employ an idb communication protocol standard such as j j j and j  an obd system as defined herein may have the capabilities and may perform the functions as proscribed by the united states code of federal regulations cfr title  cfr section  which is referred to and incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference in addition an obd system as defined herein may have the capabilities and may perform the functions as proscribed by the california code of regulations ccr title  section  which is referred to and incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference in addition an obd system as defined herein may also have additional capabilities and may perform additional functions not described in the aboveincorporated documents  a preferred embodiment of the present invention is configured to communicate with an obdii system currently there are three basic obdii protocols in use each with minor variations on the communication pattern between the obd computer and the scan console or tool for example chrysler products and most european and asian vehicles generally use iso  standard protocols chrysler is a trademark of daimler chrysler of auburn hills mich general motors vehicles generally use sae j vpw variable pulse width modulation and ford vehicles generally use sae j pwm pulse width modulation communication protocols general motors is a trademark of general motors corporation of detroit mich and ford is a trademark of ford motor company of dearborn mich  the sae j communications protocol was officially adopted by sae as the standard protocol for invehicle networks in  today sae j is implemented in a variety of production vehicles for diagnostics and data sharing purposes for example the sae j communication protocol enables an intermodule or intersensor data communication network for the sharing of information passed in frames or messages between all vehicle electronic modules nodes and sensors connected to a common bus  similarly iso  is another communication protocol used in an intermodule or intersensor data communication network for the sharing of information passed in frames or messages between all vehicle electronic modules nodes and sensors connected to a common bus it employs a serial data communication bus between the vehicles nodes modules or sensors and the scan tool as mentioned above most european and asian manufactured vehicles use the iso  communication protocol  most vehicles manufactured since  include an obd connector located in the passenger compartment area the obd connector connects to the vehicle network and can be used to obtain vehicle data for example when a “check engine light” indicator appears on a vehicle dashboard the vehicle owner takes the vehicle to a local service station the mechanic or technician connects a scan tool to the obd connector in the passenger compartment and obtains a diagnostic trouble code dtc that set off the “check engine light” indicator the technician can then determine a course of action to fix the component that set the dtc for example a dtc may be set when the vehicle ecu or computer processor no longer receives data from an oxygen sensor or receives data indicating that a fuel injector is misfiring conventional scan tools used by todays technicians to obtain vehicle data simply display the data obtained from the vehicle obd system conventional scan tools do not manipulate the vehicle data to generate additional data not provided by the obd system or the vehicle network  the present invention provides software programs or computer readable program code to manipulate data obtained from a vehicle network one embodiment of the present invention provides software programs or modules to generate data relating to several aspects of vehicle performance such as vehicle power vehicle torque vehicle fuel economy and vehicle acceleration and deceleration the software program may be stored or placed on a compact disk a floppy disk a memory module such as a flash memory device and may also be stored on a general purpose computing device and may be accessed andor downloaded via a global computer network such as the internet  the present invention contemplates the use of personal digital assistants pdas laptops hybrid phonepdas and other general purpose digital computers to obtain data from a vehicle network or obd system the various general purpose digital computers will employ one or more software programs or modules to obtain and manipulate vehicle data received from the vehicle network  with the proliferation of small powerful computers such as personal digital assistants pdas technicians mechanics and vehicle enthusiasts will be able to employ these devices instead of conventional scan tools to obtain and manipulate data from the vehicle network in addition laptop computers hybrid phonepda units electronic organizers electronic notepads and handheld computers can also be employed to obtain and manipulate data from the vehicle network for example any number of different pda platforms such as a palm handspring trw sony hewlettpackard compaq sharp nec or other pda platforms can be employed to obtain data from the vehicle network or obd system palm is a trademark of palm inc of santa clara calif handspring is a trademark of handspring inc of palo alto calif trw is a trademark of trw inc of cleveland ohio sony

employed to connect the display unit  to the protocol converter  one skilled in the art will appreciate that other arrangements of data cables  interfaces  and other plugs and cables can be employed to connect the display unit  to the vehicle obd connector   a preferred embodiment of the present invention employs a display unit  such as a pda to display and manipulate vehicle data obtained from the vehicle network or obd system in contrast to conventional vehicle data display systems the present invention manipulates the vehicle data to generate new vehicle performance data such as vehicle power vehicle torque vehicle fuel economy and vehicle acceleration this vehicle information may then displayed numerically and graphically on the display unit   referring to fig  a software program or module comprising computer readable program code constructed according to the present invention generates a computer display as shown in fig  of a vehicle power and vehicle torque by manipulating vehicle data obtained from the vehicle network  vehicle manufacturers generally provide a vehicle engine horsepower number however this number is not representative of the actual horsepower that is delivered to the driving wheel or wheels of the vehicle because the vehicle engine must first transfer power through the transmission which then transfers the power through a drive shaft which then transfers the power through a ringandpinion gear set which then transfers the power through halfshafts which then transfer the power to the driving wheels each time the power is transferred from one device to the next some power is lost and the actual horsepower generated at the driving wheels can be as much as  to  less than that generated by the vehicle engine  the present invention using data obtained from the vehicle network can calculate a horsepower available at a vehicles driving wheels herein referred to as vehicle power once the vehicle power or driving wheel power is obtained an available vehicle engine torque can also be obtained obtaining the driving wheel power and the vehicle engine torque quickly and easily can help a vehicle operator to determine whether a change to a vehicle system has improved the vehicles performance for example after installing a highflow air filter highvoltage ignition coil or other performanceenhancing device a vehicle owner can then employ the present invention and determine whether the vehicle power or vehicle torque has increased prior to the present invention a vehicle power or vehicle torque would be obtained by testing the vehicle on a dynamometer or other device one feature of the present invention is that vehicle data such as vehicle power and vehicle torque can be quickly determined by using data obtained from the vehicle network  a software module or computer readable program code constructed according to the present invention for determining a vehicle power using data obtained from a vehicle network will now be explained power is the rate of doing work or the amount of work done in a unit time work is the transfer of energy and an amount of work done is equal to the force applied multiplied by the distance traveled in the direction of that force therefore workforcedistance traveled  because power is the rate of doing work or the amount of work done in a unit time the power produced is the work done divided by the time taken powerforce distance traveledt time  from the power equation listed above force can be determined because force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration forcemassacceleration  acceleration is the rate of change of velocity speed or the average increase of velocity in a unit of time usually expressed in feet per second accelerationvvtt  where v is an end velocity v is an initial velocity t is an end time and t is an initial time the distance traveled can be obtained by finding the quotient of the change in velocity and twice the amount of time required for the change in velocity distance traveledvvtt  where v is an end velocity v is an initial velocity t is an end time and t is an initial time  when these equations are combined an equation for determining a vehicle power or driving wheel power is arrived at powermvvtt  where m is the vehicle weight v is an end velocity v is an initial velocity t is an end time and t is an initial time the unit for power in this equation is kilowatts kilowatts can be converted to horsepower by dividing kilowatts by  the resulting horsepower number is the horsepower available at the vehicles driving wheels  one feature of the present invention is that the abovedescribed vehicle power software module must only obtain the end velocity v the initial velocity v the end time t and the initial time t to generate a vehicle power the user will input the vehicle mass or weight  a preferred embodiment of the power software module may also use data related to the frontal area of the vehicle to generate a vehicle power specifically the vehicle power number generated by the abovedescribed power software module will be more accurate if the force that is used to overcome aerodynamic drag is also include in the vehicle power calculation vehicle frontal area or crosssectional area is the area of the front profile of the vehicle the frontal area is component of the power loss due to aerodynamic drag that is engine power is required to overcome the drag caused by forcing a vehicle though the air and the power required increases as vehicle speed increases  one embodiment of the present invention may include a list such as small car compact sedan sportutility vehicle and truck the user will choose the appropriate vehicle type and the vehicle power software will apply a correction factor and reduce the vehicle power number to reflect the engine power lost to overcome aerodynamic drag  another embodiment of the power software module may employ an altitude correction factor engine power decreases as altitude increases because air density decreases as altitude increases one embodiment of the present invention may allow a user to input the altitude an appropriate correction factor may then be included in the vehicle power calculation performed by the power software module  yet another embodiment of the power software module may include a tire rolling resistance correction factor each vehicle tire has a rolling resistance and an amount of engine power is required to overcome the total amount of rolling resistance generated by all of the vehicles tires one embodiment of the present invention may allow a user to input a tire rolling resistance or a list of tire rolling resistance values may be presented and the user will be able to select from the list for example the list may present a selection of tire sizes the user will select a tire size and the power software module will apply a tire rolling resistance correction factor appropriate for the chosen tire size  another embodiment of the present invention may include an actual vehicle engine horsepower software module this software module will calculate an approximation of the horsepower generated by the vehicle engine as discussed above the power delivered to the driving wheels of the vehicle is  to  less than the power generated by the engine the actual vehicle engine horsepower software module will include several correction factors to generate a close approximation of the actual power generated by the vehicle engine for example the actual vehicle engine horsepower software module may have the user select either a stickshift transmission or an automatic transmission and may also have the user select either a frontwheel drive or a rearwheel drive correction factors for each type of vehicle configuration will be included in the actual vehicle engine horsepower software module which will use the information to generate a vehicle engine horsepower  referring to fig  a computer display is illustrated with the vehicle power depicted graphically the software module constructed according to the present invention can be installed in a general computing device such as pda laptop or other type of display unit  and in a preferred embodiment of the present invention will generate a display substantially as illustrated in fig   an operator wishing to obtain a vehicle power will initiate the software module by using a stylus or other object and strike or contact the run button  at that instant the initial time t is set and the vehicle is preferably accelerated at maximum acceleration until the user strikes the stats button  stopping the test and setting the end time t the software module obtains the vehicles initial velocity v at the initial time t and obtains the vehicles end velocity v at the end time t the initial velocity v and end velocity v are obtained by accessing the vehicle network through the obd connector in the passenger compartment the software module then obtains the difference between the initial velocity v and the end velocity v and also obtains the total elapsed time which is the difference between t and t and calculates the vehicle power which represents the available horsepower at the vehicles driving wheels a power curve  is graphically displayed on the display unit  as shown in fig   once the vehicle power has been determined a vehicle torque can also be obtained by the following equation torquepower rpm  where rpm is the engine revolutionsperminute  the software module then calculates the vehicle engine torque by using the above equation and displays a torque curve  as shown in fig  also shown in fig  is a scroll bar  that can be moved by tapping or contacting the arrow buttons  the scroll bar provides an instantaneous data readout of the vehicle power or vehicle torque at a specific engine rpm thus a software module or computer readable program code constructed according to the present invention manipulates vehicle data obtained from a vehicle network or obd system to obtain data not originally provided by the vehicle network or obd system namely a vehicle power and a vehicle torque this data can then be used by a technician or vehicle owner to determine any difference in a vehicles performance before and after a modification such as the installation of a highflow air filter or highvoltage ignition coil  referring to fig  a second software module comprising computer readable program code constructed according to the present invention generates a computer display as shown in the figure of a vehicle acceleration and a vehicle engine revolutionsperminute rpm the software acceleration module can measure any number of different vehicle accelerations or decelerations such as  to  milesperhour mph or kilometersperhour kph  to  mph  to  mph  to  mph or acceleration over ¼ mile it will be appreciated that other vehicle accelerations or decelerations can also be calculated and displayed  for example referring to fig  which is displayed on a display unit  the user employs a stylus finger or other device to designate the specific acceleration data desired in the time to speed buttons  the designated acceleration test is then displayed by the acceleration software module in the fromto box  in the example illustrated in fig  an acceleration from  to  mph has been chosen by a user the user then strikes or contacts the record button  with a stylus or other device as soon as the record button  is designated the acceleration software module obtains an initial time t the acceleration software module then monitors the vehicle speed by accessing a vehicle network through the obdii connector and when the vehicle speed reaches  mph the acceleration software module obtains an end time t the acceleration software module then displays the total amount of time required to accelerate from  to  mph in the seconds box   also shown in fig  the acceleration software module displays the vehicle acceleration  and the vehicle rpm  graphically the user then has the choice of whether or not to save the specific acceleration test by striking the acceleration test save button  once the acceleration test save button  has been designated the acceleration test is saved in the display unit  one feature of the present invention is that a user can review and compare different acceleration tests to determine changes in vehicle performance  another function of the acceleration software module is the manipulation of vehicle data obtained from a vehicle network to obtain a ¼ mile data if a user wishes to obtain data on vehicle performance over a ¼ mile the ¼ mile button  is designated the user then designates the ¼ mile record button  to start the test the acceleration software module then obtains an initial time t from the display unit  when the vehicle starts moving specifically the acceleration software module accesses the vehicle network to determine when the vehicle starts moving for example the data may be obtained from a vehicle wheel speed sensor when the vehicle begins to move the acceleration software module obtains the initial time t from the display unit   the acceleration software module then continues to obtain data from the vehicle network and when the vehicle has traveled a quarter mile the acceleration software module obtains an end time t the acceleration software module then obtains a difference between the end time t and the initial time t and displays this time difference in the timesec box  the acceleration software module also obtains the vehicle speed at the point the vehicle traveled the ¼ mile distance and displays that in the speedmph box  the user then can choose to save this specific ¼ mile test by designating the ¼ mile save button  the data is then saved in the display unit  one feature of the present invention is that a user can review and compare different ¼ mile tests to determine changes in vehicle performance  another function of the acceleration software module is the breaking or stopping distance function also illustrated in fig  the user can designate the distance over which the acceleration software module will obtain data by designating a specific stopping distance box  the user then designates the stopping distance record button  and the acceleration software module accesses the vehicle network and monitors the vehicle speed or velocity the designated test example illustrated in fig  is a  to  stopping distance test and so the acceleration software module will begin recording the distance traveled once the vehicle hits  mph or kph when the vehicle comes to a complete stop the acceleration software module obtains the total distance traveled by the vehicle from  mph to rest and displays that number in the feet box  if the user wishes to save this test data the user designates the stopping distance save box  one feature of the present invention is that a user can review and compare different stopping distance tests to determine changes in vehicle performance  alternative embodiment software modules may include the capability for the user to enter different stopping distances or different timetospeed numbers so the user can choose the exact distance or exact speed from which to obtain data  referring to fig  a fuel economy software program or module comprising a computer readable program code constructed according to the present invention generates a computer display as shown in fig  of a vehicle fuel economy by manipulating vehicle data obtained from the vehicle network one feature of the present invention is the fuel economy software module employs an airtofuel ratio of  that is to achieve the current exhaust emission standards required by federal and state governments vehicle manufacturers employ a  airfuel ratio this specific fuel ratio is used to achieve the required vehicle emission standards the present invention employs this airfuel ratio to determine the vehicle economy  as shown in fig  the vehicle fuel economy can be displayed in either a milespergallon display  a  minute average display  or a vehicle trip display  a user starts the fuel economy software module by designating the trip start box  the fuel economy software module then accesses the vehicle network through the obdii connector and begins to obtain the mass of the air that is passing through the vehicle engine intake manifold when the user designates the stop button  the fuel economy software module calculates the total mass of air that passed through the vehicle intake manifold during the test period and calculates the fuel used by applying the  airfuel ratio to the mass of the air specifically the airfuel ratio affirms that for every unit of fuel used  units of air are also used therefore the fuel economy software module divides the total mass of the air used during the test by  to determine the total mass of fuel that was used during the test the fuel economy software module also obtains the total distance traveled by the vehicle during the test once the total amount of fuel is determined and the total distance traveled is determined the fuel economy software module then calculates the trip fuel economy the  minute average fuel economy and the milespergallon fuel economy to determine the  minute average fuel economy the fuel economy software module also obtains the total elapsed time for the test and calculates the  minute average each of these calculated values is displayed in the appropriate display area as shown in fig  at the end of test the user can then designate the fuel economy save box  to save the test data in the display unit  one feature of the present invention is that a user can review and compare different fuel economy tests to determine changes in vehicle performance  thus it is seen that a
