focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these

equity momentum shortterm horizon bondssharktraderscomsummarycohus recent financial performance especially improving gross profit margin makes us optimisticthe companys malaysian operation is the main catalyst behind recent improvements in its margin which is likely to help scale net income if sales growth continuesthere are several upcoming products in cohus pipeline that would help the company continue the top line growth in coming quartersit has a price target of  per share that offers secondary investors an upside potential of around  in the coming quarterssince b riley reiterated a buy rating on cohu inc nasdaqcohu on july  the stock price has increased from  per share and it is currently trading at  per share representing an increase of  over the last tenday period after analyzing the companys recent financial performance in the last few quarters we believe management has gotten its act together and found a way to improve its internal efficiency given that several new products are in the pipeline that would help the company to increase sales in the coming quarters we believe cohus top line growth momentum would likely to be sustainable we believe the stock price got the leg to climb further north as based on the current price target of  per share it appears undervalued at the current price level we remain optimistic about cohus secular growth story and recommend that secondary investors increase their exposure to this company cohus recent financial performance makes us optimistic figure  cohu incs stagnant revenue period appears to have ended over the last five years cohus revenue curve has had wild swings at the end of  its quarterly revenue was above  million which drastically reduced to below  million by the end of q  since then cohus management has struggled to deliver the growth which it was able to deliver during  that pushed the top line from  million at the end of q  to over  million  a  increase  by the end of q  since q  cohus revenue ranged between around  million to  million only however in q  revenue came out at  million the highest in the last two years and  higher compared to  million in q  figure  cohu incs management was able to increase q  gross profit margin to  while we are optimistic about the companys top line performance it is worth mentioning that it also managed to increase its gross profit margin for the first time in the last year period which came out at  in q  figure  cohu incs improved gross profit margin helped the company post a  million net income in q  as a result it was able to deliver a  million net income in q  which was considerably higher compared to the  net loss in the same quarter last year figure  cohu incs profit margin has surged to  level in q  we also found an interesting fact about the latest financial performance of the company regarding its net profit margin cohus quarterly revenue has yet to reach above  million as it was at the end of  however because of the improving internal efficiency that helped the company post a  gross profit margin in q  its q  net profit margin also increased to  which is almost at the same level as in q  we believe cohus management is on the right track to turn things around and if it can keep up the top line growth in the coming quarters its net income would likely follow as it has in q  conclusion during the q  earnings call luis müller the president and chief executive officer of cohu mentioned that the companys malaysian operation was responsible for over  of all handlers in q we believe the low cost of operation in malaysia was one of the catalysts behind its improved gross profit margin during the first quarter of  that helped the company post a  million net income furthermore we also learned their cohus test cell utilization rate across the installed base was  during q and we believe this acts as a signal to investors that the companys internal efficiency is on the rise there are several major products under review at the moment that will help cohu continue to enjoy the top line growth momentum especially the new waferlevel csp prober is on the verge of completion and the company plans to ship multiple systems from the second quarter onwards in addition the orders were up by around  with its newly acquired kita operation that makes us optimistic about the continuation of the companys top line growth as we mentioned earlier cohus management seems to have found a way to leverage the companys malaysian operation to improve margins and sales growth would likely scale its bottom line in the coming quarters currently cohu has a price target of  per share and based on the current stock price of  per share it offers secondary investors an additional  upside potential in the coming quarters therefore we recommend that secondary investors consider increasing their exposure to cohu disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
