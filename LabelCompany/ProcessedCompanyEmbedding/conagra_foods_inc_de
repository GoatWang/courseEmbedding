products giants share price has languished after a run of too many diversified acquisitions but a narrower focus could give it some momentum rich duprey tmfcop feb   at am concentrating on branded consumer foods like its chef boyardee brand should help conagra foods boost sales and profits in the future  getting into the privatelabel business was a major mistake for conagra foods nyse cag despite the growth of the whitelabel food industry the consumer food products giants  billion purchase of privategoods maker ralcorp in  never went anywhere and ceo sean connolly finally threw in the towel noting it was a a suboptimal use of the companys resources to expend the time and effort necessary to turn the business around better he decided for the company to cut its losses and focus on what works that means that soon conagra will largely be just a brand consumer food company its spun off its milling operations in a complicated threeway deal that merged them with horizon milling a joint venture of privately held cargill and chs nyse chs conagra relinquished control over daytoday operations but retained an ownership stake in the business sold most of its ralcorp private label assets to industry leader treehouse foods nyse ths for  billion and is spinning off its lamb weston potato operations what will be left is a finetuned portfolio of name brand products that includes chef boyardee manwich and slim jim this new focus means conagras stock has a good chance to rise in the future here are three reasons why  name brand goods are profitablethe new consumer brands company to be called conagra brands  with a lowercase a  will consist primarily of its consumer foods segment which had about  billion in revenues in fiscal  that was also the most profitable division generating about twothirds of the food products companys operating income operating profits for the division expanded some  over the first six months of conagras fiscal year compared to  growth in its commercial foods business it benefited from a favorable mix of prices and products strong increased productivity from its costcutting measures and lower commodity input costs which more than offset the increases it experienced in marketing and the headwinds it faced from unfavorable currency exchange rates  slimming down will help it pay down debtconagra has a heavy debt load that stood at more than  billion at the end of november  even after it used proceeds from earlier transactions to pay its debt down conversely its cash on hand was less than  millionit will be using the proceeds from the next deals to bring that down to a more manageable level the private label sale for example will primarily be used for debt reduction and conagra  expects the transaction to result in a tax asset of approximately  billion which it can use to offset future capital gains over the next five years the spinoff of lamb weston however seems curious since it doesnt give the company access to a tax loss shield and some analysts speculate it really may just be a means for conagra to attract bids for the unit  the narrowed focus may help it improve valuationcompared to rival general mills nyse gis conagras valuation is depressed including lamb weston conagra has operating margins of less than  over the first half of fiscal  while general mills enjoys margins north of  the consumer foods divisions margin however is above  and without the weight and drag of the commercial foods business or the private label operations conagra should be able to boost its numbers closer to those of its rival a smaller conagra is a better conagrado one thing but do it well seems to be the food product companys mantra these days or as warren buffett might say stick to your core competencies with a ceo who oversaw the sale of hillshire brands to tyson foods and jana partners an activist investor now on its board conagra should be able to navigate the waters to higher growth from implementing a streamlined costeffective business after nearly a half year during which its stock traded in a fairly narrow range the company now has a clear focus on its future and investors may just be poised to reap the rewards of patience as conagras shares rise   rich duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned try any of our foolish
