today that it has raised  million in series a financing the round was led by lightspeed venture partners with additional investment from existing backer carmel ventures founded in  ensilo emerged from stealth mode in march  the new investment will be used to expand the company’s global operations in particular in the north america market and to open us offices on the west coast given the everincreasing scope and tenacity of targeted cyberattacks on businesses organizations and governments ensilo diverges from the widelyaccepted notion that external threat actors can be prevented from infiltrating networks the company instead assumes that organizations have already been compromisedand focuses on preventing the exfiltration of critical data – precisely the most critical and costly aspect of cyberattacks with ensilo’s offering against targeted attacks employees are still able to continue working even when the system is infected  “in the same way chronicallyill patients are provided treatment to increase quality of life and longevity organizations must assume that they are working with a persistently compromised network and learn how to maintain businessasusual despite the contaminated environment” said roy katmor ceo  cofounder of ensilo “time and time again organizations’ networks are infiltrated we seek to shift the model from trying to block inbound threats to concretely stopping threat actors already on the inside from inflicting damage and stealing valuable data” when ensilo’s solution detects a data exfiltration attempt it sends a single alert to the customer notifying them of the situation and blocks malicious outbound communications by generating only one alert per active threat ensilo eliminates the paralyzing scourge of alarms faced by informationsecurity teams david gussarsky partner at lightspeed venture partners who has joined ensilo’s board of directors following the investment said “we are excited to invest in a company whose innovative solution gives corporations and organizations the best of both worlds first the assurance that their data is fully protected and second the knowledge that even if a device becomes infected the company can continue working while the threat is resolved” ronen nir a general partner at carmel ventures who led the seed round and sits on ensilo’s board of directors added “at carmel ventures we are excited to continue our long term partnership with the exceptionally talented founding team of ensilo that is already helping businesses protect their assets with its innovative dataexfiltration prevention solution that shows just how eager the market is for this new approach” ensilo’s research team recently discovered a vulnerability in all versions of windows – from windows xp to windows  technical preview – which could be exploited by malicious actors to bypass all the security measures in windows by modifying only a single bit the security hole was reported and microsoft released a security patch in february    about ensilo ensilo offers a realtime targeted attack exfiltration prevention platform ensilo has developed a platform which accurately distinguishes legitimate connections from malicious ones from the moment a connection is established our solution provides virtual patching against advanced targeted threats enabling employees to keep working as

ventures and telecommunications firm ericssonthe lexington massbased company will use the money to complete prototypes for its chips that it touts as energyefficient parallel computing chips the deal is a big endorsement for adapteva’s technology which can be used to provide energyefficient parallel processing in telecommunications basestations — such as those made by ericsson — and a variety of other supercomputing devicesthe funding comes on the heels of the company’s success in the fall of  when it raised almost  on kickstarter to build a  parallella supercomputer for everyone that campaign was part of the company’s effort to build community support around its hardware among hobbyists and other hardware enthusiastsadapteva was founded in  to develop a brand new architecture with a focus on energyefficient chips it designed a core parallel processing accelerator and a core chip in  now it is trying to bring those epiphany chips which can operate on  watts of power to manufacturing the processors can deliver about five gigaflops of performance per wattadaptevaandreas olofsson of adaptevamost chip projects costs huge amounts of money and use lots of engineers but adapteva has made it this far with just five people the new funding will keep the dream of building a new chip architecture alive“we’ve been waiting for our moment to come and i think we are almost there” andreas olofsson chief executive and founder of adapteva in an interview with venturebeat “we’ve been running on a very low capital structure for six years now selling a new processor architecture is almost impossible but we have one of the most efficient chips in the world”olofsson said that adapteva’s parallel processors — which have many brains or cores working at once — offer a  times edge in computing efficiency when compared to older approaches“the potential for major returns in energy efficiency and performance gained from parallel processing are clear and in fact critical to support rapid growth in the telecoms industry this makes innovations such as adapteva’s very exciting for ericsson and for the customers we work with” said sebastian tolstoy ericsson vice president of business developmentto try to bring adapteva’s chips to a wider market adapteva launched parallella a tiny supercomputer in  the kickstarter campaign raised money to develop a  circuit board for kickstarter donors in doing that adapteva followed in the footsteps of fanhyped hardware companies like rasberry pi the creditcard sized computer that can play games like quakeit hasn’t delivered the boards to its  kickstarter backers yet but olofsson said the company would do so now that it has more money shipments are targeted to be completed by the end of the first quarteropen source community members are contributing software for adapteva olofsson said the company can chain multiple epiphany chips together for a total of  cores in a system that could be useful in scientific computing telecommunications and embedded vision“we’re going to be the most open chip company around” olofsson saidadapteva will compete with rivals such as tilera nvidia advanced micro devices arm and intel so far  systems have been preordered olofsson said  universities are collaborating with adapteva to educate students on parallel computing and there’s a fairly large scientific computing customer waiting in the wings olofsson has more than  patents issued or pending he’s a former chip designer for analog devices“parallel processing and high performance computing hpc are of huge interest to us as these markets are developing quickly and changing dramatically” said ori bendori partner at carmel ventures “adapteva’s approach is very different than the traditional silicon
