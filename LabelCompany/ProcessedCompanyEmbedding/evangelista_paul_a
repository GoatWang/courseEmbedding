with the audio soundtrack top  the art of  shaving top  about paul  the barber the name evangelista in hairdressing paul the barber’s family history the worldcare organisation the training of paul and vincent present day the name evangelista in hairdressing the name evangelista in hairdressing the name evangelista is synonymous with hairdressing for almost  years since pauls grandfather arrived on these shores from his native italy the dynasty has come a long way since the early days when grandfather angelo learned to cut his familys hair because he couldnt afford to send them to the barbers after some yrs angelo handed the family business over to his son adolpho who started his training at the early age of yrs he and his father angelo worked together in linthouse until my father started his own barbershop in the then thriving community of govan he in turn taught me and we worked together for many years in  paul opened his own barbershop in the town of johnstone where he has continued to offer his tonsorial services for the “discerning man” for some yrs now paul is now happy to carry through the family tradition into the th generation by inviting his two sons paul  vincent to learn the “art of barbering” both of them have now completed their training and paul jnr now manages his own successful barbershop in sauchiehall street in glasgow called the sauchiehall st barbers and has also expanded his business to include absolut hair for the ladies vincent now operates his own barbershop in the town of renfrew and has called it evangelistas barbershop so now the family cycle of barber training has been completed and now guarantees that our family history of barbers will continue well into the future we can only hope that “hair” will always be part of human evolution and finallyyou may be wondering why there is no image of paul evangelista himself on this page well this is due to the fact that some have said paul bares a slight resemblance to a certain nintendo character but well let you be the judge of that click here to view the picture incidentally paul evangelista is the one on the right angelo evangelista    adolpho evangelista    paul the barber’s family history paul the barber’s family history hello everyone i guess i should start this story from as far back in time as possible and i have managed to research our history to the year  where we found that our family name is derived from the personal name of evangelista which it is said reflects devotion to san giovanni evangelista which translates to st john the evangelist which in turn is derived from the greek evangelistes which means good news one of the earliest references we could find to this name is a record of one giovanni evangelista a cleric writer and teacher mentioned in  notable bearers of our surname include another giovanni he was a goldsmith mathematician and draftsman cited in  seventeen century records from casamassima bari mentions the birth of angela antonia evangelista daughter of vito evangelista and rosa pisingo registered on the th november  we also read of a marriage between pietro antonio evangelista and angela mattea also registered in casamassima on the th may  and also their son bartolemeo evangelista documented in  michelangelo evangelista and anna di paolo were wed in another small village near bari called corato on the th december  apparently there are other bearers of our surname include francesco paolo evangelista a sculptor born in  then came a gaetano evangelista a writer born in  there was also alfredo evangelista a music composer mentioned in  then came my grandfather angelo evangelista born in rome  who was to begin our barbering dynasty in linthouse near the town of govan with his first barbers chair he also had a brother named joseph who was to take a different path in hairdressing and become a very successful ladies hairdresser in london paris and italy where he won many top competitions and awards from  and was patronised by leading society and attended to ladies for the royal coronation then came my own father adolpho evangelista married to yolanda de angelis both born  in scotland they had three sons ramonde me and ricardo there’s are a few “voids” left within my research but i haven’t finished the work on all my family connections as yet as you can well understand it takes so much time and effort to do but one day i will or perhaps one of my sons will take up the work so here we have finally arrived at me paul evangelista born in  and married to connie jannetta born  both born in edinburgh and married in edinburgh we have two sons paul  vincent now we leap a couple of decades to my first day in my father’s barbershop in  where unknown to me i was to embark on a fantastic and interesting journey through the winding paths we sometimes take in life and it was also to be the beginning of my “life education” and to gain a variety of knowledge from my clients not forgetting to give a good haircut in return my father was a great barber and a great friend to many of his clients someone to talk and joke with but ultimately walking out with a great haircut he did teach me well in the art of barbering and that took yrs and of course there were the “good times and the bad times” but his reward from all his patient efforts teaching me was to go fishing in his day off and fish for salmon and he enjoyed this great occasion with his good friends once a week to some of the finest salmon rivers that are found here in scotland unfortunately the only aspect that failed to “rub off” on me was his ability to tell jokes and funny stories which he was famed for in his barbershop his clients liked that quality in him and there was many a time when the shop would be in full laughter at his jokes and gossip talk incidentally history tells us that ancient barbershops were centres for news talking politics and gossip…so i think there has been no change there for a thousand years or so those were very enjoyable learning years for me but eventually the urge to move on and do my own thing became overpowering and so i left to open up my own barbershop in  and after  yrs on my own my father sold his barbershop in govan and so once again we worked together for many years it was unfortunate that he did not live long enough to see his two fine grandsons follow in the family footsteps i think he would be very proud to see them barbering now but such is life…and such is death we all move on the best way we can so my story continues through to my own barbershop which i am now in my th enjoyable year in the town of johnstone and it’s friendly people wow doesn’t time fly when your enjoying yourself and i give great applaud and thanks to my clientele for helping me make evangelistas barbershop a success through their continued loyalty and also to thank my new clients who found me through word of mouth and our websitewebcam i have said on numerous occasions that when you walk into my barbershop youre never a stranger just a friend that i havent yet met i must tell you a story from the first few weeks in my own barbershop so here we have a young paul the barber who had a lot of life learning to do and one day this guy came in to have his hair cut and so we were chatting about where i came from and how the new barbershop was doing just the normal kind of chat and so after he paid for his haircut he mentioned that he worked in a nearby factory that produced olive oil and said that if i gave him £ he would get me a  litre can of the stuff so i thought it was a great opportunity and duly handed over the money thinking it was a great deal i had expected his return but lo and behold…i never did see him again stupid me who has ever heard of a factory in scotland that produces olive oil he must have thought here was a right mug and very “green behind the ears” so as the day wore on and he had failed to turn up i asked another customer if there was such a local factory his smiling reply was not that i’m aware of why do you want to know i was too embarrassed to tell him the story of the guy whom i gave over money for the “local olive oil” so there lay my first valuable lesson in business the worldcare organisation the worldcare organisation i have always been an environmentally thinking person and i do respect our beautiful planet and all life on earth i remember displaying a poster in my barbershop which i bought in the ’s many of my clients commented how true these words were even in  they were from an old american indian chief who prophesised only after the last tree has been cut downonly after the last river has been poisonedonly after the last fish has been caughtonly then will you find that money cannot be eaten these words are so true of events that are happening just now and i felt the urge to help and contribute to a healthier planet and realised that after a few years in business some of my high profile business clients were interested in what i had to say about our environment so realising that i had a captive audience to preach my idea of creating an organisation called worldcare a nonprofit and charitable organisation dedicated to the improvement of our environment to which i would give my spare time and so through their generosity and involvement in sponsoring glass banks back in  worldcare was created and started recycling glass to raise funds for the local st vincent’s hospice and over a period of between yrs since worldcare’s inception in  it successfully raised public awareness on the importance of recycling and how to look after our environment we covered a lot of environmental ground with our local cleanup campaigns and recycling various materials such as glasscans and cardboard we even had our very own marathon runner and we were also given the opportunity to collect redundant computers and printers which was very lucrative and with help from our sponsors we raised enough revenue to purchased the worldcare van and through one of our other sponsors they converted the engine to run on natural gas which then made our vehicle completely environment friendly and actually influenced one of my clients who owned a local transport company to buy one of the new breed of environmentally friendly trucks of that time we received great local and not so local publicity for our endeavours and in  worldcare received a prestigious environmental award from the shell best of better britain campaign for our recycling efforts in which my most memorable memory of this event was to travel to london with my wife and family to receive this award from sir david attenborough whom we all know as a very learned man actively raising great awareness in the preservation of our planet and ecosystem this was indeed a great occasion and achievement for the worldcare organisation and it’s few volunteers which was to be further enhanced a few weeks later by the scottish version of the same award but on this occasion to be presented at stirling castle by magnus magnusson kbe the scottish equivalent to sir david so as you can imagine we were all very proud and excited at the success of worldcare unfortunately i was becoming more and more involved in the running of the organisation as volunteers thinned out and it was beginning to affect the time or rather lack of time i gave to with my wife connie and bringing up our two young sons and secondly the smooth running of the barbershop as there wasn’t a day gone by without phone calls in between haircutting concerning worldcare activity it was becoming too much for me to control and with the lack of volunteers to delegate the organisation and work something had to give and sadly it had to be worldcare but it always remains dear to me and perhaps one of these days i might have the opportunity to give it a rebirth firms bottle banks boost hospice funds pauls fag free zone wins award the training of paul and vincent the training of paul and vincent this whole story is a tribute to my grandfather angelo my father adolfo and to my two sons paul  vincent who now continue in our family tradition of barbers into a fourth generation so i started the training process of my eldest son paul jnr who like me was to take yrs to learn the family skills and like all parents we know that teaching your own anything in life is not an easy task but we eventually made it through the trials and tribulations put before us and he was eventually “trained up and shipped out” to make his own mark in the hairdressing world but also to make way for his younger brother vincent where he and i embarked on another yr intensive training programme and so after the yr training process of my two sons i believe this is where my very own “deforestation” took place hence the lack of hair but hey it’s been worth the blood sweat and tears and at least my wife connie and me came out at the other end relatively happy paul jnr giving his dad a trim  vincent evangelista looking and learning from his father paul in  present day present day so here i am to the present day telling you of my family history to the best of my knowledge i hope you have found it interesting before i go i must tell you about the virtual barbershop experience this was initially the idea of one of my clients and great friend stefano the creator of this website and after a great deal of discussion over a haircut or two we thought that it would be an interesting “people project” to install a webcam in the barbershop with the live virtual barbershop experience now discontinued i can share with you some cuttings from the archives by ways of a little sampling of the daily comings and going of my work day and you can of course “look in” on me from time to time and see me doing what i love doing mostcutting hair and listening to a variety of music thank you for your time and i wish you and yours all the best that life can bring tonsorially yours

spent by arthur mclellan artist  poet top  short history of  the barbers pole the barbers trade is indeed an ancient one razors have been found among relics of the bronze age circa  bc barbering is mentioned in the bible by ezeikiel who said and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a barbers razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thine beard barbering was introduced in rome in  bc and barbers soon became popular and prosperous their shops were centres for daily news and gossip all free men of rome were cleanshaven while slaves were forced to wear beards it is from the roman word barba meaning beard that the word barber is derived about  bc alexander the great made his soldiers shave regularly for the purpose of gaining an advantage in handtohand combat so that his warriors were able to grasp an enemy by the beard while they themselves were safeguarded in this method of combat the barbers of early days were also surgeons and dentists since the barbers were involved not only in haircutting shaving and surgery they formed their first organisation in france  ambroise pare the father of modern surgery and the greatest surgeon of the renaissance began his career as a barbersurgeon the origins of the barbers pole appears to be associated with the service of bloodletting the original pole has a brass basin at its top representing the vessel which leeches were kept and also represented the basin which received the blood the pole itself represented the staff which the patient held onto during the operation the red and white stripes represented the bandages used during the procedure red for the bandages stained with blood during the operation and white for the clean bandages these would then be hung out to dry after washing on the pole and would blow and twist together forming the spiral pattern similar to the modern day barber pole so there we have the barber pole  a historic link with surgery top  contact paul  shop hours  location address
