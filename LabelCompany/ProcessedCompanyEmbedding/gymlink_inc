regarding federally sponsored researchnot applicableparties to a joint research agreementnot applicablereference to appendixnot applicablefield of the inventionthe field of the present invention generally relates to systems and methods for facilitating inperson group activities events or meetings and more particularly to such systems and methods which are webbased and at least partially have democratic administration by group membersbackground of the inventionin social networking people are often interested in forming groups of people having a common interest or interests these online groups can be used connect the online users in real life via inperson group activitiesmost current online sites that facilitate groups follow a pretty simple hierarchy the administrators has absolute control in choosing the group name choosing the groups profile pictures restricting who can join the group granting permissions deleting andor adding content to the group pages scheduling group activities or events etc often if the group is large moderators are granted restricted permissions to manage content and users of the group users typically have the least control over their own group interacting with it and one another only on the terms of the administrator this group system wherein one person or a very small group of people has absolute control can be referred to as an autocratic type group although sometimes they are technically more oligarchicus pat no  the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein in its entirety by reference was issued to meetup inc and discloses an example of an autocratic type group system while the meetup inc system gives administrators the option to have members vote on locations agendas times andor other variables when scheduling an activity it is simply a poll of the users the administrator controls the voting options and ultimately makes the decision after voting is done it is entirely up the administrators to decide whether to take into account the vote and if so to what degree in continuing the government systems analogies this is a benevolent dictatorshipadditionally for many administrators in the meetup inc system their groups serve as a business the meetup inc system offers the ability for administrators to charge users dues andor fees for participating in activities or events while this inspires hosts to put together some great experiences it gives the service a transactional feel and may reduce the number of users that decide to participate in the activities or eventsthese current systems present a number of problems the most concerning of which is an activity or event bottleneck one administrator or a small group of administrators often cant create the number of activities that a large number of users need andor want additionally with one person making the decisions as to the types of activities or events added the activities or events will likely be less varied if you enjoy an activity but dont share the tastes of the administrator youre out of luck furthermore there is the possibility of administrators bullying users acting in the disinterest of the group andor generally abusing their powerbusinesses or organizations that may benefit from sponsoring online groups may elect not to be a sponsor because of concerns about these current systems first administration of online groups can require a substantially large amount of their staffs time and can mandate hiring additional employees second individual members gaining too much influence within the community as group administrators businesses and organizations certainly do not want to provide a platform that could enable someone to lead an exodus of customers or members from their business or organizationaccordingly there is a need for improved systems and methods for electronically facilitating inperson activities that are reliable provide a positive user experience andor reduce administrative costs for the sponsorsummary of the inventiondisclosed are systems methods and software for facilitating inperson activities which address one or more issues of the related art as

group according to the present invention first the user  indicates that they want to open a new group by selecting the suggest activity link  and the software displays a form  containing fields for entering information regarding the new group the user defines the group type as either “active” centered around a physical activity  or “lifestyle” focused on nonphysical activities and hobbies including nutrition and health  and then selects the interest or activity on which new group will be centered from a predetermined list  automatically provided to the user such as for example clay pigeon shooting cycling ice climbing rock climbing etc see fig  the software then automatically determines whether there is already a group servicing the indicated interest or activity if there is an existing group the user  is notified of the redundancy and is unable to continue creating the new group if there is not an existing group the user  is notified that they are allowed to proceed with creating a new group the user must select a “create” link or input  in order to confirm their desire to continue to open the new group see fig  it is noted that the new group selection page  can alternatively have any other suitable form the software then automatically references the sponsor address to add the name of the sponsors city in the beginning of the group type to form the group name  for example “climbing” becomes “austin climbing” thus the group name  is automatically generated from the name selected from the group type list  and the sponsors city resulting in uniform group names  the group names  are not determined by the requesting user the software then automatically provides a preassigned photo related search tags and group description to the database of groups the individual group and group feed pages are then automatically created and added to the “connect” and “home” sections of the application respectively the requesting user is then added to the group and given basic user permissions the requesting user can then viewjoin group events invite friends post photostext to the dedicated group feed and propose tentative group activitiesfig  illustrates a flow diagram showing how a user  can propose a new group activity or event according to the present invention first the user indicates that they want to propose a new group activity by selecting or touching the “suggest activity” link or input  on the group feed or home page  see fig  and the software displays a form  containing fields for entering information regarding the proposed group activity see fig  the illustrated fields include a description of the proposed activity  the date and start and finish times for the proposed group activity  the meeting location for the proposed group activity  gear and skill level requirements for the proposed group activity  contact information that is optional of the user proposing the new group activity  the user  then must select or touch a link or input “post”  with posting the proposed group activity it is noted that the suggested activity input page  can alternatively have any other suitable formas best shown in fig  the software then automatically generates a “tentative activity” posting  which is displayed on the group feed page  that displays at least some of the information about the proposed group activity and also automatically generates a listing  on the calendar page best shown on fig  additional information regarding the proposed activity can be viewed on a tentative individual activity page  shown in fig  which the user can go to by selecting the “show more” link also displayed is a link or input “interested”  which when selected by a user  provides a positive level of interest in joining the tentative activity the illustrated embodiment also displays a number  indicating the quantity of positive responses already received such as for example the number “” shown in fig  it is noted that users  cannot join the tentative activity while it is posted as a tentative activity as users  view the tentative activity posting and indicate any positive level of interest in the proposed group activity the software automatically compares the current number  of positive level of interests received with a predetermined number of positive level of interest that automatically triggers the software to automatically create an individual activity page  for the new activity that can be reached via the aggregated calendar page  the predetermined number of positive level of interest can be any suitable number such as for example  when the individual activity page  is created for the new group activity the software automatically sends a notification of the generation of the activity page for the proposed inperson activity to the users  who sent a positive interest level for the proposed or tentative inperson activity these users  and any other users  can then enroll or join the newly posted group activity it is noted that the tentative activity posting  can alternatively have any other suitable formhowever the software automatically deletes the tentative activity posting  along with the calendar listing  and the tentative individual activity page  for the proposed inperson activity at a predetermined time if the predetermined number of the positive interest level has not been received from the users  the predetermined time can be any suitable time such as for example one hour or one day etc prior to the propose start time for the proposed or tentative group activity if the tentative activity posting  is deleted the software automatically sends an electronic notification of the deletion of the tentative activity posting  to users  who sent a positive interest level for the proposed inperson activity and that the proposed activity will not take placeit should be appreciated from the above description that the scheduling of the new group activities is a democratic process for the group members  that is a predetermined level of interest of the group members  determines which if any of the proposed group events are scheduled administrators do not make any determination as to scheduling or not scheduling group events or activities the term “democratic is used herein to mean “control of the organization or group is by the majority andor predetermined number of its members”fig  illustrates a flow diagram showing a method for group members selecting photographs to be displayed in the group photograph collage  with a democratic process members of a

friend flag post i just recently purchased the charge hr product  i particularly think its cool that the android fitbit app seems to be able to show an almost realtime update of the metrics being fed by the device  one of the reasons i was shopping for a heartrate monitor capable device is that my polar chest strap unit began to die and they do not contain user replaceable batteries so the problem i used the polar chest strap heavily in combination with a rowing machine that would adjust resistance in order to maintain a target heartrate  its a fine machine but older and uses polars gym link khz signals  it does not seem that the charge hr transmits these frequencies regardless i am a developer by trade and electronics hobbyist on the side and wondered if it would be possible to read the data from the fitbit then build out a transmitter that took that data and fed it to the rowing machine  i cant seem to find any third party products that can do this and im having a dilly of a time figuring out where to get at the realtime data any chance to development of any sort in a device that converts these signals or is the fitbit never going to be able to be used with gymlink machines accepted solution labels net  votes reply all forum topics previous topic next topic  replies ‎  mark as new bookmark subscribe highlight print email to a friend flag post patruns fitbit

‎  mark as new bookmark subscribe highlight print email to a friend flag post thebossman wroteno device allows direct access to that information i am looking to look at heart rate in real time using a common consumer electronic like fitbit we got tired of the research grade stuff this wont be possiblei think that should be qualified to say no fitbit device allows direct access to that information  while it uses ble as the actual radio carrier it uses proprietary protocols for the data payloads  perhaps that is because it exchanges so much more data than using standard ble profile support would permit efficiently  or maybe they designed their protocols before the various ble profiles were finalized i dont know of any ble to gymlink repeaters out there  i think there are a few ble to ant gateways but ive never seen a ble to gymlink  i used the polar h until my second one died the radio not the battery  i ended up switching to the mio wrist based monitors  sadly they dont support gymlink though what im more disappointed in though is that it seems recent gym equipment has not added support for ble sensors  my local gym just replaced all their treadmills and i was hoping the new ones would have ble support  sadly they still only support gymlink as does their rowers if interested though you should check out the various official ble profiles such as the heart rate profile  docs are available here and should work with a number of consumer grade hrm devices such as those from polar wahoo mio etc  if you think you can develop a box to rebroadcast the ble to gymlink equipment you may want to consider a kickstart or similar project id back you   accepted solution  votes reply ‎  mark as new bookmark subscribe highlight print email to a friend flag post jeremiahfitbit
