hedge fund q investments a  billion hedge fund founded by former bass family investor geoffrey raynor holds a  percent stake in cedar fair and has demanded that apollo sweeten its  billion offer or take a hike raynor’s demand for a higher offer has thrown a wrench into what was a friendly deal signed off on by cedar fair’s management apollo in december offered  a share for the ohiobased company whose park assets include knott’s berry farm in california shareholders are set to vote on the deal march  while shareholders demanding higher takeover offers is nothing new q’s ability to get into the middle of apollo’s deal has surprised many including the people at apollo sources familiar with the matter said “it’s a funny situation” a banker said “it’s david vs goliath and apollo is the establishment” matters have been made more complicated by mutualfund company neuberger berman siding with q on the deal neuberger holds a  percent stake in cedar fair and combined the two dissident shareholders hold a  percent stake posing a big threat to apollo getting the twothirds investor support it needs to approve the deal sources familiar with the matter said apollo could win over the dissidents if it raised its offer to around  a share but a person close to the parties said getting to that price would be tough “there is not a lot of wiggle room” this person said “the numbers are pretty tight now to reach the expected return” what’s more sources said financially struggling cedar fair is expected to report earnings today that won’t justify a higher offer neuberger q and apollo
