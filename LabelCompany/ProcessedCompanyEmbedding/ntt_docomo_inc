ntt docomo inc skip to content microsoft enterprise no results enterprise enterprise customer story ntt docomo inc by microsoft customer stories on february   filed under microsoft citynext skip share links share ntt docomo inc has been providing mobile communication services primarily for mobile phones under the slogan of “creating new communications culture” as japan’s largest mobile communications carrier in  ntt docomo revamped their “traffic data warehouse” that handles traffic data for the billingsettlement system using microsoft sql server as a result quick analysis and usage of billing data was enabled for more than  million subscriber lines to further improve customer service further cost structure reforms and improvements in a flexible data platform to cope with everchanging managerial needs have also been promoted decision on fundamental overhaul of data warehouse processing to cut costs and improve usability while terminals – such as mobile phones smartphones and tablets – become ever more diverse and new services are introduced one after another it is essential for mobile carriers to handle new services and customer needs and quickly and appropriately develop infrastructure to support them in order to do so a data analysis and usage system to understand and reflect everchanging user needs in real time is indispensable under such circumstances a “traffic data warehouse hereafter traffic dwh” that aggregates usage data for all subscriber lines which is situated at the backend of “mobills” a billing system for accounting and settlement of subscribers has been renewed using sql server ntt docomo inc hereafter ntt docomo implemented reliable security measures established secure flexible and quick traffic data analysis platform and significantly curtailed system costs “ntt docomo introduced reform measures to provide greater value from last fiscal year one of their policies is to accelerate our business using data from docomo account’s settlement platform the recent renewal of the traffic dwh is a part of the trials to create new services and value using that settlement data” commented yuki shimamura general manager billing system information systems division ntt docomo inc mobills is the billing and settlement platform for all of the more than  million subscriber lines for ntt docomo and sql server has recently been introduced for the traffic dwh that handles the data analysis platform for mobills for this traffic dwh different companies’ database and business intelligence bi products were combined and business applications were constructed on it for operation before renewal however shinichi shimamoto assistant manager billing system information systems division ntt docomo inc disclosed that many issues have recently arisen “firstly conveniencerelated issues such as slow search and download were mentioned by the user division the system capability was not able to keep up with the current pace of business a more important point was the efficiency and cost of periodic development for example if an output form for ledger data is changed the overall application needs to be modified but although the change looks small the development and modification costs were kept high” in the case of the former traffic dwh the necessary data was extracted from the enormous traffic data of mobills via multiple summary processes due to the it technology specifications and restrictions at the construction stage therefore the final output ledger was modified and the application that handles the intermediate processing needs to be changed so the cost for their development manhours and testing etc increased significantly “it was evident that it would be difficult to achieve meaningful cost reductions which was the main management issue as long as a multilayered application structure exists thus efforts were made to fundamentally revamp the traffic dwh processing method in order to cut costs while simultaneously improving user convenience which was the purpose of this project” commented mr shimamoto decision to adopt sql server based on powerful search function and cost effectivess the traffic dwh renewal project started in january  masaki inoue manager billing system information systems division ntt docomo inc who organized the initial grand design at the beginning of the project commented that he thought this was a unique opportunity to revamp the system to enable it to contribute further to business growth and expansion by flexibly coping with future changes in the business environment rather than simply controlling billing information as had been the case when the project started “if the existing system had simply been updated as it was it would certainly have been safer and easier however the system itself must be flexible enough to be changed in the face of future business opportunities otherwise new value would never be gained those of us who were in charge of the system had to take on the challenge of constructing a new flexible system that could quickly cope with a variety of data analysis demands from top management and the work front in order to achieve the midterm goals” accordingly a product comparison of platforms for new information analysis and usage was promoted and we decided to adopt sql server in april  kenshiro kitayama billing system information systems division ntt docomo inc mentioned the powerful search function as a deciding factor “we had built up our expectations about the columnstore index that could achieve dramatically superior query performance compared to conventional general row tables and enable sql server to perform update processing this function has fewer practical restrictions and we evaluated that it enables flexible and quick data search in accordance with our requirements” another deciding factor was its superior cost performance in the case of sql server the license for the main database engine includes everything such as integration services which is an etl tool analysis services and reporting services “this is suitable for dwh system processing including batch processing because those tools are included at no extra charge in particular we expected that the olap tool which can use an inmemory database function would enable significant cost improvements in analysis and search system processing moreover all necessary tools are included in the main product so it was judged to also be beneficial in terms of compatibility between database and tools” commented mr kitayama a flexible support contract that is unique to microsoft japan whereby a payasyougo plan could be selected not just a fixed amount from a maintenance fee menu was also highly evaluated after deciding to adopt it the design development and testing etc were quickly promoted and tests on a headtohead comparison between the old and new systems were conducted in december  after confirming that quality is reliable operation started in february  masanori morita manager billing system information systems division ntt docomo inc who was in charge of application migration explained that one reason for the quick migration of an enormous dwh that handles the traffic for all subscriber lines while safeguarding the high quality and safe operation was careful verification “the most important theme during the construction process was ensuring quality specifically headtohead comparisons were conducted on the processing results between the former and new systems and it took two months of verification until the results matched perfectly in terms of the ledger even though the development period was short sufficient time was set aside for verification which was how we managed to realize such high quality” mr inoue also commented “the main reason we could complete the project with such high quality within such a short time was that all of the project members positively shared the sense of a “new challenge” and promoted it with motivation and empathy until the end promoting the project in close cooperation with microsoft japan was also a big factor” in addition to significant cost savings for periodic development  cut in software maintenance costs as a system that introduces sql server at both scale and missioncritical levels the new traffic dwh that has recently been renewed using sql server can reasonably be considered japan’s leading dwh norio kawaguchi billing system information systems division ntt docomo inc revealed its scale by presenting its main numeric values “about  divisions of ntt docomo in japan use the traffic dwh as one index of the scale of the traffic dwh it handles over one billion items of traffic data per day a minimum number is set for the right to access the ledger data per user which is a maximum of about  cases a month various analysis axes are also provided and about  types of screens are used all traffic data is covered so a couple of thousand records comprise a ledger as a large example” the principal advantage provided through the recent renewal is reduced costs for periodic development sql server’s columnstore index enables a high performance search through a large amount of data which was not possible with the former traffic dwh so multilayered processing that used to be needed is no longer required and most applications that were needed to create interim tables are also unnecessary “as a result the number of interim tables and application materials have been reduced by thirty to forty percent compared to the existing version” said mr inoue since the number of tables has been reduced their maintenance costs have also been reduced by about twenty percent in addition the overall development scale has been reduced and the number of tables created has also been reduced so hidden maintenance costs such as related failures caused by bug and setting errors are also reduced this has been confirmed with the first periodic material release since the renewal in may  software maintenance costs have been significantly reduced by about  compared to the previous ratio as a result of integrating a combination of the old dwh database and analysis tools to sql server additional expenses for analysis tools etc are no longer incurred also most of the fixed costs are no longer needed because support can be used only in as necessary using the “premier support contract” based on a payasyougo plan “aside from the cost some skills have been transferred thanks to support from microsoft japan during the development process so the foundations for future development and troubleshooting have been laid within the project system which is another gain” noted mr shimamoto the information systems division expects a significant contribution will be made upon realization of the theme ie cost cutting which was the original intent as the system stabilizes further as time passes because the maintenance costs based on the payasyougo plan will further reduce on the other hand mr morita pointed out that a remarkable effect has naturally been seen in terms of improved user convenience “the traffic dwh receives and accumulates data once an hour from switching equipment and mobills and starts processing that data from midnight every day it renews all ledgers with the latest data by  am on the same day in order to process over a billion traffic items a day sufficient size has been prepared but a further allowance has been received for the processing cycle to be completed by  am on the same day as a result of improved data processing efficiency thanks to sql server” aiming to create a realtime analysis platform to provide new added value mr inoue described his vision of further growth of mobills as a platform to analyze and use data in realtime based on the experience of the new traffic dwh that has been revamped by sql server “batch processing used to be the standard as analysis systems for data usage but analyzing each item of data as it is generated and reacting in response to trends will be more important in current conditions as the iot market expands for example analyzing customers’ billingsettlement data in realtime and quickly providing optimal additional value and services to each customer bolsters customer satisfaction and helps to expand our business in order to achieve that we would like to advance the data analysis platform such as traffic dwh to enable it to analyze and use enormous amounts of data in realtime” on the other hand mr kawaguchi noted that he anticipates the potential for improvements in inhouse user convenience currently microsoft® sharepoint® is used as the front screen for traffic dwh users so microsoft® excel®based uis can easily be developed “we have also used microsoft® office in many cases internally so we received very few inquiries from users regarding the user interface after the recent system renewal one of the factors in selecting sql server is its inherent compatibility with ms office and we hope to provide more advanced functions and improve ease of use for end users while maintaining security” mr shimamura emphasized the importance of mobills and traffic dwh again regarding ntt docomo’s future business development stating “promoting collaboration with all types of partner companies in order to react to everdiversifying customer needs is specified as a midterm goal in other words stepping up from the former “competition” to “cooperation and creation” at the information systems division and mobills we handle tasks to support the data platform for that and traffic dwh is a platform to collect and analyze the direct usage trends of users” “currently ntt docomo is also promoting the renewal of the data warehouse of “aladin” a customer management system using sql server in the path of mobills with a midterm goal “cooperation and creation with partners in the smart life area and reinforcing competitiveness for communication business” with further improvements in the platform for usage of customer data expected sql server provides ongoing support for ntt docomo’s future

service that restricts access to harmful sites such as dating sites and adult sites so as to allow children to use mobile phones with peace of mind ntt docomo offers a urlcontaining email rejection setting as a countermeasure against unwanted email these two services are supported by netstars url database which encompass not just pc sites but also mobile phone sites ntt docomo inc hereafter referred to as docomo is an industry pioneer for example commercializing mobile phone services equipped with imode an internet access function before any of its competitors the increase in the number of minor users of mobile phone services such as imode increases has been accompanied by a rise in the number of crime victims and incidents triggered by browsing of dating sites and adult sites as a countermeasure starting in  docomo began offering kids imode currently kids imode filter an optional service for minors that restricts access to sites other than imode menu sites as part of efforts to address social needs for security however these days elementary schools increasingly put up their own websites and in the case of filtering with blanket denial of access to sites other than imode menu sites customer needs are not served so url filtering is now gathering attention as a new countermeasure starting in  docomo has been offering kids imode plus currently named imode filter a service for restricting access to sites falling under specific categories such as dating sites and adult sites this service blocks access to sites such as dating sites and adult sites that are considered harmful to the sound development of minors through filtering that uses netstars url databases while allowing access to sites offering useful information for life such as school websites moreover as changes such as the cancellation of access restriction services or lowering the restriction level require parental consent this service is highly praised and trusted by all quarters as a revolutionary service that can drastically restrict misuse of mobile phone sites by minors further starting in  docomo changed the name of its kids imode plus service to imode filter to reflect further evolution of this service to answer a wider range of filtering needs including for example corporate customers wishing to reduce communication costs caused by unnecessary access by others in addition to minors this new service is enjoying a very favorable reception business needs for access management are greater than anticipated and the majority of corporate contracts for the batch introduction of mobile phones elect to use the imode filter ito along with dating sites and adult sites unwanted email is a major annoyance for mobile phone services at docomo in addition to original unwanted email countermeasures we started in  to apply filtering using netstars url databases which we had used thus far for the imode filter to unwanted emails this resulted in the addition of the urlcontaining email rejection setting to our service menu although initially we just thought about providing the urlcontaining email rejection setting as one of our unwanted email countermeasure setting menu items upon actual introduction the effectiveness of this service was very clear to see and since it was easy to set we find it to be effective for promotion to customers who are not comfortable with handling devices whose number is on the rise says inoue attesting to a favorable reception of this service that went beyond docomos expectations the reasons why docomo chose to use netstar are the quality and track record of its databases since before the imode filter docomo used netstar for blocking specific sites for its mopera u internet service for foma and the quality of netstars databases had been demonstrated regarding the provision of the urlcontaining email rejection setting ito says we selected netstar based on its trustworthiness for mopera u and imode filter however since there are unwanted email specific urls we newly established the category of unwanted email links describing selection and determination of categories according to the purpose of a service the imode filter and urlcontaining email rejection setting are both provided free of charge due to the wish for peace of mind striving to avoid having docomo mobile phones be the cause of experiences with harm however before during consultations regarding unwanted email countermeasures we would have to provide guidance regarding setting contents such as individual receptionblocking setting after having heard how the customer uses email now we can just recommend the urlcontaining email rejection setting says yamada expressing high regard for the effect on raising customer satisfaction for docomo which attaches great importance to the peace of mind of its customers both the imode filter and urlcontaining email rejection setting services will see their importance grow in the future we conducted thorough testing to ensure that top items appearing on multiple search sites can be  guarded says takashi ito platform development manager platform department product  service division since we make peace of mind one of our sales points imode filter and urlcontaining email rejection setting are both important services says akiko inoue first security promotion incharge contents  customer department demand for the urlcontaining email rejection setting has been steadily increasing since its introduction says megumi yamada first security promotion incharge contents  customer department in order to maintain and improve filtering accuracy netstar operates the industrys first dedicated mobile phone site url collection team fulltime researchers working year round classify links included in emails

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
