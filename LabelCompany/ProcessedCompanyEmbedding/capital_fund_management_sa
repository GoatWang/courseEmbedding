returns date september  authors yves lempérière cyril deremble trungtu nguyen philip seager marc potters jeanphilippe bouchaude print httpxxxlanlgovabs the aim of our work is to propose a natural framework to account for all the empirically known properties of the multivariate distribution of stock returns we define and study a nested factor model where the linear factors part is standard but where the logvolatility of the linear factors and of the residuals are themselves endowed with a factor structure and residuals we propose a calibration procedure to estimate these logvol factors and the residuals we find that whereas the number of relevant linear factors is relatively large  or more only two or three logvol factors emerge in our analysis of the data in fact a minimal model where only one logvol factor is considered is already very satisfactory as it accurately reproduces the properties of bivariate copulas in particular the dependence of the medialpoint on the linear correlation coefficient as reported in chicheportiche and bouchaud  we have tested the ability of the model to predict outofsample the risk of nonlinear portfolios and found that it performs significantly better than other schemes empirical read more endogenous crisis waves a stochastic model with synchronized collective behavior date september  authors stanislao gualdi jeanphilippe bouchaud giulia cencetti marco tarzia francesco zamponie print httparxivorgabs we propose a simple framework to understand commonly observed crisis waves in macroeconomic agent based models that is also relevant to a variety of other physical or biological situations where synchronization occurs we compute exactly the phase diagram of the model and the location of the synchronization transition in parameter space many modifications and extensions can be studied confirming that the synchronization transition is extremely robust against various sources of noise or imperfections theory read more slow decay of impact in equity markets date july  authors x brokmann e serie j kockelkoren jp bouchaude print httparxivorgabs using a proprietary dataset of metaorders and prediction signals and assuming a quasilinear impact model we deconvolve market impact from past correlated trades and a predictable return component to elicit the temporal dependence of the market impact of a single daily metaorder over a ten day horizon in various equity markets we find that the impact of single metaorders is to a first approximation universal and slowly decays to zero or to a small value possibly as a powerlaw we show that autocorrelated orderflows and trade information contents fully accounts for the apparent plateau observed in the raw data we discuss the possible bias introduced by the quasilinear assumption empirical read more instabilities in large economies aggregate volatility without idiosyncratic shocks date september  authors julius bonart jeanphilippe bouchaud augustin landier david thesmare print httpxxxlanlgovabs we study a dynamical model of interconnected firms which allows for certain market imperfections and frictions restricted here to be myopic price forecasts and slow adjustment of production whereas the standard rational equilibrium is still formally a stationary solution of the dynamics we show that this equilibrium becomes linearly unstable in a whole region of parameter space when agents attempt to reach the optimal production target too quickly coordination breaks down and the dynamics becomes chaotic in the unstable turbulent phase the aggregate volatility of the total output remains substantial even when the amplitude of idiosyncratic shocks goes to zero or when the size of the economy becomes large in other words crises become endogenous this suggests an interesting resolution of the small shocks large business cycles puzzle theory read more signalwise performance attribution for constrained portfolio optimisation date april  authors bruno durine print  httparxivorgabs performance analysis from the external point of view of a client who would only have access to returns and holdings of a fund evolved towards exact attribution made in the context of portfolio optimisation which is the internal point of view of a manager controling all the parameters of this optimisation attribution is exact thatistosay no residual interaction term remains and various contributions to the optimal portfolio can be identified predictive signals constraints benchmark however constraints are identified as a separate portfolio and attribution for each signal that are used to predict future returns thus corresponds to unconstrained signal portfolios we propose a novel attribution method that put predictive signals at the core of attribution and allows to include the effect of constraints in portfolios attributed to every signal we show how this can be applied to various trading models and portfolio optimisation frameworks and explain what kind of insights such an attribution provides technical read more two centuries of trend following date april  authors y lempérière c deremble p seager m potters j p bouchaude print httparxivorgabs we establish the existence of anomalous excess returns based on trend following strategies across four asset classes commodities currencies stock indices bonds and over very long time scales we use for our studies both futures time series that exist since  and spot time series that allow us to go back to  on commodities and indices the overall tstat of the excess returns is  since  and  since  after accounting for the overall upward drift of these markets the effect is very stable both across time and asset classes it makes the existence of trends one of the most statistically significant anomalies in financial markets when analyzing the trend following signal further we find a clear saturation effect for large signals suggesting that fundamentalist traders do not attempt to resist weak trends but step in when their own signal becomes strong enough finally we study the performance of trend following in the recent period we find no sign of a statistical degradation of long trends whereas shorter trends have significantly withered empirical read more a fully consistent minimal model for nonlinear market impact date november  authors jonathan donier julius bonart iacopo mastromatteo jeanphilippe bouchaude print httpxxxlanlgovabs we propose a minimal theory of nonlinear price impact based on a linear latent order book approximation inspired by diffusionreaction models and general arguments our framework allows one to compute the average price trajectory in the presence of a metaorder that consistently generalizes previously proposed propagator models we account for the universally observed squareroot impact law and predict nontrivial trajectories when trading is interrupted or reversed we prove that our framework is free of price manipulation and that prices can be made diffusive albeit with a generic shortterm meanreverting contribution our model suggests that prices can be decomposed into a transient mechanical impact component and a permanent informational component theory read more an instanton approach to large n harishchandraitzyksonzuber integrals date march  authors joel bun jeanphilippe bouchaud satya n majumdar marc potterse print httparxivorgabs we reconsider the large n asymptotics of harishchandraitzyksonzuber integrals we provide using dysons brownian motion and the method of instantons an alternative transparent derivation of the matytsin formalism for the unitary case our method is easily generalised to the orthogonal and symplectic ensembles we obtain an explicit solution of matytsins equations in the case of wigner matrices as well as a general expansion method in the dilute limit when the spectrum of eigenvalues spreads over very wide regions technical read more branching ratio approximation for the selfexciting hawkes process date march  authors stephen j hardiman jeanphilippe bouchaude print httpxxxlanlgovabs we introduce a model independent approximation for the branching ratio of hawkes selfexciting point processes our estimator requires knowing only the mean and variance of the event count in a sufficiently large time window statistics that are readily obtained from empirical data the method we propose greatly simplifies the process of hawkes branching ratio estimation proposed as a proxy for market endogeneity in recent publications and formerly estimated using numerical maximisation of likelihood we employ this method to support recent theoretical and experimental results indicating that the best fitting hawkes model to describe sp futures price changes is in fact critical now and in the recent past in light of the long memory of financial market activity empirical read more anomalous impact in reactiondiffusion models date march  authors iacopo mastromatteo bence toth jeanphilippe bouchaude print httparxivorgabs we generalize the reactiondiffusion model a  b   in order to study the impact of an excess of a or b at the reaction front we provide an exact solution of the model which shows that linear response breaks down the average displacement of the reaction front grows as the squareroot of the imbalance we argue that this model provides a highly simplified but generic framework to understand the squareroot impact of large orders in financial markets theory read more momentum strategies with l filter date march  authors tunglam daoe print httparxivorgabs in this article we discuss various implementation of l filtering in order to detect some properties of noisy signals this filter consists of using a l penalty condition in order to obtain the filtered signal composed by a set of straight trends or steps this penalty condition which determines the number of breaks is implemented in a constrained least square problem and is represented by a regularization parameter which is estimated by a crossvalidation procedure financial time series are usually characterized by a longterm trend called the global trend and some shortterm trends which are named local trends a combination of these two time scales can form a simple model describing the process of a global trend process with some meanreverting properties explicit applications to momentum strategies are also discussed in detail with appropriate uses of the trend configurations theory read more agentbased models for latent liquidity and concave price impact date november  authors iacopo mastromatteo bence toth jeanphilippe bouchaude print httpxxxlanlgovabs we revisit the eintelligence model of toth et al   that was proposed as a minimal framework to understand the squareroot dependence of the impact of metaorders on volume in financial markets the basic idea is that most of the daily liquidity is latent and furthermore vanishes linearly around the current price as a consequence of the diffusion of the price itself however the numerical implementation of toth et al was criticised as being unrealistic in particular because all the intelligence was conferred to market orders while limit orders were passive and random in this work we study various alternative specifications of the model for example allowing limit orders to react to the order flow or changing the execution protocols by and large our study lends strong support to the idea that the squareroot impact law is a very generic and robust property that requires very few ingredients to be valid we also show that the transition from superdiffusion to subdiffusion reported in  is in fact a crossover but that the original model can be slightly altered in order to give rise to a genuine phase transition which is of interest on its own we finally propose a general theoretical framework to understand how a nonlinear impact may appear even in the limit where the bias in the order flow is vanishingly small theory read more skew and implied leverage effect smile dynamics revisited date november  authors vincent vargas tunglam dao jeanphilippe bouchaude print httpxxxlanlgovabs we revisit the smile dynamics problem which consists in relating the implied leverage ie the correlation of the atthemoney volatility with the returns of the underlying and the skew of the option smile the ratio between these two quantities called skewstickiness ratio ssr by bergomi smile dynamics iv risk  december  saturates to the value  for linear models in the limit of small maturities and converges to  for long maturities we show that for more general nonlinear models such as the asymmetric garch model bergomis result must be modified and can be larger than  for small maturities the discrepancy comes from the fact that the volatility skew is in general different from the skewness of the underlying we compare our theory with empirical results using data both from option markets and from the underlying price series for the sp and the dax we find among other things that although both the implied leverage and the skew appear to be too strong on option markets their ratio is well explained by the theory we observe that the ssr indeed becomes larger than  for small maturities empirical read more the fine structure of volatility feedback ii overnight and intraday effects date september  authors pierre blanc rémy chicheportiche jeanphilippe bouchaude print httpxxxlanlgovabs we decompose within an arch framework the daily volatility of stocks into overnight and intraday contributions we find as perhaps expected that the overnight and intraday returns behave completely differently for example while past intraday returns affect equally the future intraday and overnight volatilities past overnight returns have a weak effect on future intraday volatilities except for the very next one but impact substantially future overnight volatilities the exogenous component of overnight volatilities is found to be close to zero which means that the lions share of overnight volatility comes from feedback effects the residual kurtosis of returns is small for intraday returns but infinite for overnight returns we provide a plausible interpretation for these findings and show that our intradayovernight model significantly outperforms the standard arch framework based on daily returns for outofsample predictions empirical read more a nested factor model for nonlinear dependences in stock returns date september  authors rémy chicheportiche jeanphilippe bouchaude print httpxxxlanlgovabs the aim of our work is to propose a natural framework to account for all the empirically known properties of the multivariate

macroeconomic agentbased models date july  authors stanislao gualdi marco tarzia francesco zamponi and jeanphilippe bouchaude print httparxivorgabs the aim of this work is to explore the possible types of phenomena that simple macroeconomic agentbased models abm can reproduce our motivation is to understand the large macroeconomic fluctuations observed in the mark i abm devised by d delli gatti and collaborators our major finding is the existence of a first order discontinuous phase transition between a good economy where unemployment is low and a bad economy where unemployment is high we show that this transition is robust against many modifications of the model and is induced by an asymmetry between the rate of hiring and the rate of firing of the firms this asymmetry is induced in mark i by the interest rate as the interest rate increases the firms become more and more reluctant to take further loans the unemployment level remains small until a tipping point beyond which the economy suddenly collapses if the parameters are such that the system is close to this transition any small fluctuation is amplified as the system jumps between the two equilibria we have also explored several natural extensions one is to allow this hiringfiring propensity to depend on the financial fragility of firms quite interestingly we find that in this case the above transition survives but becomes second order we also studied simple wage policies and confidence feedback effects whereby higher unemployment increases the saving propensity of households we observe several interesting effects such as the appearance of acute endogenous crises during which the unemployment rate shoots up before the economy recovers we end the paper with general comments on the usefulness of abms to model macroeconomic phenomena in particular in view of the time needed to reach a steady state theory read more some applications of firstpassage ideas to finance date june  authors rémy chicheportiche jeanphilippe bouchaude print httparxivorgabs many problems in finance are related to first passage times among all of them we chose three on which we contributed personally our first example relates kolmogorovsmirnov like goodnessoffit tests modified in such a way that tail events and core events contribute equally to the test in the standard kolmogorovsmirnov the tails contribute very little to the measure of goodnessoffit we show that this problem can be mapped onto that of a random walk inside moving walls the second example is the optimal time to sell an asset modelled as a random walk with drift such that the sell time is as close as possible to the time at which the asset reaches its maximum value the last example concerns optimal trading in the presence of transaction costs in this case the optimal strategy is to wait until the predictor reaches plus or minus a threshold value before buying or selling the value of this threshold is found by mapping the problem onto that of a random walk between two walls empirical read more a fokkerplanck description for the queue dynamics of large tick stocks date april  authors a garèche g disdier j kockelkoren jp bouchaude print httparxivorgabs motivated by empirical data we develop a statistical description of the queue dynamics for large tick assets based on a twodimensional fokkerplanck diffusion equation that explicitly includes state dependence ie the fact that the drift and diffusion depends on the volume present on both sides of the spread jump events corresponding to sudden changes of the best limit price must also be included as birthdeath terms in the fokkerplanck equation all quantities involved in the equation can be calibrated using highfrequency data on best quotes one of our central finding is the the dynamical process is approximately scale invariant ie the only relevant variable is the ratio of the current volume in the queue to its average value while the latter shows intraday seasonalities and strong variability across stocks and time periods the dynamics of the rescaled volumes is universal in terms of rescaled volumes we found that the drift has a complex twodimensional structure which is a sum of a gradient contribution and a rotational contribution both stable across stocks and time this drift term is entirely responsible for the dynamical correlations between the ask queue and the bid queue empirical read more critical reflexivity in financial markets a hawkes process analysis date february  authors stephen j hardiman nicolas bercot and jeanphilippe bouchaude print httparxivorgabs we model the arrival of midprice changes in the emini sp futures contract as a selfexciting hawkes process using several estimation methods we find that the hawkes kernel is powerlaw with a decay exponent close to  at short times less than  supsup seconds and crosses over to a second powerlaw regime with a larger decay exponent   for longer times scales in the range supsup supsup seconds more importantly we find that the hawkes kernel integrates to unity independently of the analysed period from  to  this suggests that markets are and have always been close to criticality challenging a recent study which indicates selfreflexivity endogeneity has increased in recent years as a result of increased automation of trading however we note that the scale over which market events are correlated has decreased steadily over time with the emergence of higher frequency trading empirical read more eigenvectors dynamic and local density of states under free addition date january  authors romain allez and jeanphilippe bouchaude print httparxivorgabs we investigate the evolution of a given eigenvector of a symmetric deterministic or random matrix under the addition of a matrix in the gaussian orthogonal ensemble we quantify the overlap between this single vector with the eigenvectors of the initial matrix and identify precisely a cauchyflight regime in particular we compute the local density of this vector in the eigenvalues space of the initial matrix our results are obtained in a non perturbative setting and are derived using the idea of ledoit and péché in  finally we revisit our former results on the eigenspace dynamics giving a robust derivation of a result obtained in  in a semiperturbative regime technical read more weighted kolmogorovsmirnov test accounting for the tails date october  authors rémy chicheportiche and jeanphilippe bouchaude print httparxivorgabs accurate goodnessoffit tests for the extreme tails of empirical distributions is a very important issue relevant in many contexts including geophysics insurance and finance we have derived exact asymptotic results for a generalization of the largesample kolmogorovsmirnov test well suited to testing these extreme tails in passing we have rederived and made more precise the approximate limit solutions found originally in unrelated fields first in l turban j phys a    and later in p l krapivsky and s redner am j phys    technical read more crises and collective socioeconomic phenomena simple models and challenges date september  authors jeanphilippe bouchaude print httparxivorgpdfpdf financial and economic history is strewn with bubbles and crashes booms and busts crises and upheavals of all sorts understanding the origin of these events is arguably one of the most important problems in economic theory in this paper we review recent efforts to include heterogeneities and interactions in models of decision we argue that the socalled random field ising model rfim provides a unifying framework to account for many collective socioeconomic phenomena that lead to sudden ruptures and crises we discuss different models that can capture potentially destabilising selfreferential feedback loops induced either by herding ie reference to peers or trending ie reference to the past and that account for some of the phenomenology missing in the standard models we discuss some empirically testable predictions of these models for example robust signatures of rfimlike herding effects or the logarithmic decay of spatial correlations of voting patterns one of the most striking result inspired by statistical physics methods is that adam smiths invisible hand can fail badly at solving simple coordination problems we also insist on the issue of timescales that can be extremely long in some cases and prevent socially optimal equilibria from being reached as a theoretical challenge the study of socalled detailedbalance violating decision rules is needed to decide whether conclusions based on current models that all assume detailedbalance are indeed robust and generic theory read more a proposal for impactadjusted valuation critical leverage and execution risk date august  authors f caccioli jp bouchaud jd farmere print httparxivorgabs the practice of valuation by markingtomarket with current trading prices is seriously flawed under leverage the problem is particularly dramatic due to the concave form of market impact selling always initially causes the expected leverage to increase there is a critical leverage above which it is impossible to exit a portfolio without leverage going to infinity and bankruptcy becoming likely standard riskmanagement methods give no warning of this problem which easily occurs for aggressively leveraged positions in illiquid markets we propose an alternative accounting procedure based on the estimated market impact of liquidation that removes the illusion of profit this should curb the leverage cycle and contribute to an enhanced stability of financial markets theory read more weve walked a million miles for one of these smiles date april  authors l de leo v vargas s ciliberti jp bouchaud e derive a new exact and transparent expansion for option smiles which lends itself both to analytical approximation and to congenial numerical treatments we show that the skew and the curvature of the smile can be computed as exotic options for which the hedged monte carlo method is particularly well suited when applied to options on the sp index we find that the skew and the curvature of the smile are very poorly reproduced by the standard edgeworth cumulant expansion most notably the relation between the skew and the skewness is inverted at small and large vols a feature that none of the models studied so far is able to reproduce furthermore the aroundthemoney curvature of the smile is found to be very small in stark contrast with the highly kurtic nature of the returns empirical read more optimal trading with linear costs date march  authors joachim de lataillade cyril deremble marc potters  jeanphilippe bouchaud we consider the problem of the optimal trading strategy in the presence of linear costs and with a strict cap on the allowed position in the market using bellmans backward recursion method we show that the optimal strategy is to switch between the maximum allowed long position and the maximum allowed short position whenever the predictor exceeds a threshold value for which we establish an exact equation this equation can be solved explicitely in the case of a discrete ornsteinuhlenbeck predictor we discuss in detail the dependence of this threshold value on the transaction costs finally we establish a strong connection between our problem and the case of a quadratic risk penalty where our threshold becomes the size of the optimal nontrading band technical read more the joint distribution of stock returns is not elliptical date november  authors remy chicheportiche jeanphilippe bouchaude print httparxivorgpdfpdf using a large set of daily us and japanese stock returns we test in detail the relevance of student models and of more general elliptical models for describing the joint distribution of returns we find that while student copulas provide a good approximation for strongly correlated pairs of stocks systematic discrepancies appear as the linear correlation between stocks decreases that rule out all elliptical models intuitively the failure of elliptical models can be traced to the inadequacy of the assumption of a single volatility mode for all stocks we suggest several ideas of methodological interest to efficiently visualise and compare different copulas we identify the rescaled difference with the gaussian copula and the central value of the copula as strongly discriminating observables we insist on the need to shun away from formal choices of copulas with no financial interpretation empirical read more anomalous price impact and the critical nature of liquidity in financial markets date november  authors b toth y lemperière c deremble j de lataillade j kockelkoren jp bouchaude print httparxivorgabs we propose a dynamical theory of market liquidity that predicts that the average supplydemand profile is vshaped and  the influence of rare events is taken into account reliably our method can be seen as a correctly probabilized scenario calculation or stresstesting technical read more rational decisions random matrices and spin glasses date january  authors stefano galluccio jeanphilippe bouchaud marc potters e print arxivcondmat we consider the problem of rational decision making in the presence of nonlinear constraints by using tools borrowed from spin glass and random matrix theory we focus on the portfolio optimisation problem we show that the number of optimal solutions is generically exponentially large rationality is thus de facto of limited use in addition this problem is related to spin glasses with levylike longranged couplings for which we show that the ground state is not exponentially degenerate technical read more universality classes for extreme value statistics date july  authors jeanphilippe bouchaud marc mezard e print arxivcondmat the low temperature physics of disordered systems is governed by the statistics of extremely low energy states it is thus rather important to discuss the possible universality classes for extreme value statistics we compare the usual probabilistic classification to the results of the replica approach we show in detail that one class of independent variables corresponds exactly to the socalled one step replica symmetry breaking solution in the replica language this universality class holds if the correlations are sufficiently weak we discuss the relation between the statistics of extremes and the problem of burgers turbulence in decay technical read more random walks liquidity molasses and critical response in financial markets date june  authors jeanphilippe bouchaud julien kockelkoren marc potters e print arxivcondmat stock prices are observed to be random walks in time despite a strong long term memory in the signs of trades buys or sells lillo and farmer have recently suggested that these correlations are compensated by opposite long ranged fluctuations in liquidity with an otherwise permanent market impact challenging the scenario proposed in quantitative finance    where the impact is transient with a powerlaw decay in time the exponent of this decay is precisely tuned to a critical value ensuring simultaneously that prices are diffusive on long time scales and that the response function is nearly constant we provide new analysis of empirical data that confirm and make more precise our previous claims we show that the powerlaw decay of the bare impact function comes both from an excess flow of limit order opposite to the market order flow and to a systematic anticorrelation of the bidask motion between trades two effects that create a liquidity molasses which dampens market volatility empirical read more stiff field theory of interest rates and psychological future time date march  authors belal baaquie jeanphilippe bouchaud e print arxivcondmat the simplest field theory description of the multivariate statistics of forward rate variations over time and maturities involves a quadratic action containing a gradient squared rigidity term however this choice leads to a spurious kink infinite curvature of the normalized correlation function for coinciding maturities motivated by empirical results we consider an extended action that contains a squared laplacian term which describes the bending stiffness of the frc with the extra ingredient of a psychological future time describing how the perceived time between events depends on the time in the future our theory accounts extremely well for the phenomenology of interest rate dynamics empirical read more fluctuations and response in financial markets the subtle nature of random price changes date july  authors jeanphilippe bouchaud yuval gefen marc potters matthieu wyart e printarxivcondmat using trades and quotes data from the paris stock market we show that the random walk nature of traded prices results from a very delicate interplay between two opposite tendencies longrange correlated market orders that lead to superdiffusion or persistence and mean reverting limit orders that lead to subdiffusion or antipersistence we define and study a model where the price at any instant is the result of the impact of all past trades mediated by a non constant propagator in time that describes the response of the market to a single trade within this model the market is shown to be in a precise sense at a critical point where the price is purely diffusive and the average response function almost constant we find empirically and discuss theoretically a fluctuationresponse relation we also discuss the fraction of truly informed market orders that correctly anticipate short term moves and find that it is quite small empirical read more more statistical properties of order books and price impact date october  authors marc potters jeanphilippe bouchaud e print arxivcondmat we investigate present some new statistical properties of order books we analyse data from the nasdaq and investigate a the statistics of incoming limit order prices b the shape of the average order book and c the typical life time of a limit order as a function of the distance from the best price we also determine the price impact function using french and british stocks and find a logarithmic rather than a powerlaw dependence of the price response on the volume the weak time dependence of the response function shows that the impact is surprisingly quasipermanent and suggests that trading itself is interpreted by the market as new information empirical read more statistical properties of stock order books empirical results and models date march  authors jeanphilippe bouchaud marc mezard marc potters e print arxivcondmat we investigate several statistical properties of the order book of three liquid stocks of the paris bourse the results are to a large degree independent of the stock studied the most interesting features concern i the statistics of incoming limit order prices which follows a powerlaw around the current price with a diverging mean and ii the humped shape of the average order book which can be quantitatively reproduced using a zero intelligence numerical model and qualitatively predicted using a simple approximation empirical read more introducing variety in risk management date july  authors fabrizio lillo rosario n mantegna jeanphilippe bouchaud marc potters e print arxivcondmat we review the recently introduced concept of variety of a financial portfolio and we sketch its importance for risk control purposes the empirical behaviour of variety correlation exceedance correlation and asymmetry of the probability density function of daily returns is discussed the results obtained are compared with the ones of a onefactor model showing strengths and limitations of this model empirical read more more stylized facts of financial markets leverage effect and downside correlations date january  authors marc potters jeanphilippe bouchaud published  physica a statistical mechanics and its applications  volume  issues –  october  pages –   we discuss two more universal features of stock markets the socalled leverage effect a negative correlation between past returns and future volatility and the increased downside correlations for individual stocks the leverage correlation can be rationalized in terms of a new ‘retarded’ model which interpolates between a purely additive and a purely multiplicative stochastic process for stock indices a specific market panic phenomenon seems to be necessary to account for the observed amplitude of the effect as for the increase of correlations in highly volatile periods we investigate how much of this effect can be explained within a simple nongaussian onefactor description with time independent correlations in particular this onefactor model can explain the level and asymmetry of empirical exceedance correlations which reflects the fattailed and negatively skewed distribution of market returns empirical read more the leverage effect in financial markets retarded volatility and market panic date january  authors jeanphilippe bouchaud andrew matacz marc potters e print arxivcondmat we investigate quantitatively the socalled leverage effect which corresponds to a negative correlation between past returns and future volatility for individual stocks this correlation is moderate and decays exponentially over  days while for stock indices it is much stronger but decays faster for individual stocks the magnitude of this correlation has a universal value that can be rationalized in terms of a new retarded model which interpolates between a purely additive and a purely multiplicative stochastic process for stock indices a specific market panic phenomenon seems to be necessary to account for the observed amplitude of the effect empirical read more correlation structure of extreme stock returns date june  authors pierre cizeau marc potters jeanphilippe bouchaud e print arxivcondmat it is commonly believed that the correlations between stock returns increase in high volatility periods we investigate how much of these correlations can be explained within a simple nongaussian onefactor description with time independent correlations using surrogate data with the true market return as the dominant factor we show that most of these correlations measured by a variety of different indicators can be accounted for in particular this onefactor model can explain the level and asymmetry of empirical exceedance correlations however more subtle effects require an extension of the one factor model where the variance and skewness of the residuals also depend on the market

empirically the forward rate curve frc of  different currencies we confirm and extend the findings of our previous investigation of the us forward rate curve in particular the average frc follows a squareroot law with a prefactor related to the spot volatility suggesting a valueatrisk like pricing we find a striking correlation between the instantaneous frc and the past spot trend over a certain time horizon in agreement with the idea of an extrapolated trend effect we present a model which can be adequately calibrated to account for these effects empirical read more apparent multifractality

volatility correlations known to be present in financial data although our model is monofractal by construction it shows apparent multiscaling as a result of a slow crossover phenomenon on finite time scales our results suggest that it might be hard to distinguish apparent and true multifractal behavior in financial data our model also leads to a new family of stable laws for sums of correlated

curve date december  authors jeanphilippe bouchaud nicolas sagna rama cont nicole elkaroui marc potters e print arxivcondmat this paper contains a phenomenological description of the whole us forward rate curve frc based on an data in the period  we find that the average frc measured from the spot rate grows as the squareroot of the maturity with a prefactor which is comparable to the spot rate volatility this suggests that forward rate market prices include a risk premium comparable to the probable changes of the spot rate between now and maturity which can be understood as a valueatrisk type of pricing the instantaneous frc however departs form a simple squareroot law the distortion is maximum around one year and reflects the market anticipation of a local trend on the spot rate this anticipated trend is shown to be calibrated on the past behaviour of the spot itself we show that this is consistent with the volatility hump around one year found by several authors and which we confirm finally the number of independent components needed to interpret most of the frc fluctuations is found to be small we rationalize this by showing that the dynamical evolution of the frc contains a stabilizing second derivative line tension term which tends to suppress short scale distortions of the frc this shape dependent term could lead in principle to arbitrage however this arbitrage cannot be implemented in practice because of transaction costs we suggest that the presence of transaction costs or other market imperfections is crucial for model building for a much wider

arxivcondmat the concepts of scale invariance selfsimilarity and scaling have been fruitfully applied to the study of price fluctuations in financial markets after a brief review of the properties of stable levy distributions and their applications to market data we indicate the shortcomings of such models and describe the truncated levy flight as an alternative model for price movements furthermore studying the dependence structure of the price increments shows that while their autocorrelation function decreases rapidly to zero the correlation of their squares and absolute values shows a slow power law decay indicating persistence in the scale of fluctuations a property which can be related to the anomalous scaling of the kurtosis in the last section we review in the light of these empirical facts recent attempts to draw analogies between scaling in financial markets and in turbulent flows empirical read more linear models for the impact of order flow on prices ii the mixture transition distribution model date april  authors damian eduardo taranto giacomo bormetti jeanphilippe bouchaud fabrizio lillo bence toth e print arxiv modeling the impact of the order flow on asset prices is of primary importance to understand the behavior of financial markets part i of this paper reported the remarkable improvements in the description of the price dynamics which can be obtained when one incorporates the impact of past returns on the future order flow however impact models presented in part i consider the order flow as an exogenous process only characterized by its twopoint correlations this assumption seriously limits the forecasting ability of the model here we attempt to model directly the stream of discrete events with a socalled mixture transition distribution mtd framework introduced originally by raftery  we distinguish between pricechanging and non pricechanging events and combine them with the order sign in order to reduce the order flow dynamics to the dynamics of a fourstate discrete random variable the mtd represents a parsimonious approximation of a full highorder markov chain the new approach captures with adequate realism the conditional correlation functions between signed events for both small and large tick stocks and signature plots from a methodological viewpoint we discuss a novel and flexible way to calibrate a large class of mtd models with a very large number of parameters in spite of this large number of parameters an outofsample analysis confirms that the model does not overfit the data empirical read

episodes of large fluctuations and been inefficient for at least  years we briefly review recent theoretical results as well as the neurological basis of trend following and finally argue that these asset price properties can be attributed to two fundamental mechanisms that have not changed for many centuries an innate preference for trend following and the collective tendency to exploit as much

zoltan eisler jeanphilippe bouchaud e print httparxivorgabs the vast majority of recent studies in market impact assess each product individually and the interactions between their order flows are disregarded this strong approximation may lead to an underestimation of trading costs and possible contagion effects transactions mediate a significant part of the interaction between different instruments in turn liquidity shares the sectorial structure of market correlations which can be encoded as a set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors we introduce a multivariate linear propagator model that successfully describes such a structure and reproduces well the response and a significant fraction of the covariance matrix of returns we explain in detail the various dynamical mechanisms that contribute to these quantities we also define two simplified models with substantially less parameters to reduce overfitting and show that they have superior outofsample performance empirical read

the overthecounter credit index market where no limit order book is used contracts are traded via dealers that compete for the orders of clients despite this distinct microstructure we successfully apply the propagator technique to estimate the price impact of individual transactions because orders are typically split less than in multilateral markets impact is observed to be mainly permanent in line with theoretical expectations a simple method is presented to correct for errors in our classification of trades between buying and selling we find a very significant temporary increase in order flow correlations during late  and early  which we attribute to increased order splitting or herding among investors we also find indications that orders advertised to less dealers may have lower price impact quantitative results are compatible with earlier findings in other more classical markets further supporting the argument that price impact is a universal phenomenon to a large degree

m potters jp bouchaud e print httparxivorgabs we study several aspects of the socalled lowvol and lowbeta anomalies some already documented such as the universality of the effect over different geographical zones others hitherto not clearly discussed in the literature our most significant message is that the lowvol anomaly is the result of two independent effects one is the striking negative correlation between past realized volatility and dividend yield second is the fact that exdividend returns themselves are weakly dependent on the volatility level leading to better riskadjusted returns for lowvol stocks this effect is further amplified by compounding we find that the lowvol strategy is not associated to short term reversals nor does it qualify as a riskpremium strategy since its overall skewness is slightly positive for practical purposes the strong dividend bias and the resulting correlation with other valuation metrics such as earnings to price or book to price does make the lowvol strategies to some extent redundant at least for equities empirical read more rotational invariant estimator for general noisy matrices date february  authors joël bun romain allez

asymptotic global law estimate for three general classes of noisy matrices significantly extending previously obtained results we give exact results concerning the asymptotic deviations called overlaps of the perturbed eigenvectors away from the true ones and we explain how to use these overlaps to clean the noisy eigenvalues of m we provide some numerical checks for the different

tipping points in macroeconomic agent based models jedc    with the aim of investigating the role and efficacy of monetary policy of a central bank that sets the interest rate such as to steer the economy towards a prescribed inflation and unemployment level our major finding is that provided its policy is not too aggressive in a sense detailed in the paper the central bank is successful in achieving its goals however the existence of different equilibrium states of the economy separated by phase boundaries or dark corners can cause the monetary policy itself to trigger instabilities and be counterproductive in other words the central bank must navigate in a narrow window too little is not enough too much leads to instabilities and wildly oscillating economies this conclusion strongly

at some time t for the three relevant scaling relations between the time t and the dimension n of the matrix xt we determine the asymptotic meansquared projections of any given nonperturbed eigenvector ψj⟩ associated to an eigenvalue aj of a which may lie inside the bulk of the spectrum or be isolated spike from the other eigenvalues on the orthonormal basis of the perturbed eigenvectors

interdisciplinary research team provides innovative solutions to complex problems in the risk management and regulation of financial markets also through the unique collaboration between academics and practitioners we are training the next generation of researchers and risk managers for example our models for the dynamics of liquidity in financial markets is of utmost importance to understand the stability of these markets and the possible occurrence of crashes the institute achieves its goals through collaborative research activities involving academics and practitioners the organization of high profile scientific events at the interface of theory and practice with a view to disseminating research results to risk managers and regulators phd studentships on topics relating to the quantitative modelling of financial risks opportunities for imperial researchers to join the institute’s research through the cfmimperial postdoctoral research fellowship opportunities for distinguished international scholars to visit imperial college and interact with institute members and students through the cfmimperial distinguished visitor series cfm foundation for research our business and investment strategies have been built on an academic approach to finance using the academic background of our researchers mainly phds in physics or other hard sciences to exploit inefficiencies in financial markets we’ve hired many people from top academic institutions and our founders share a similar academic focus we therefore have always had good access to and relationships with the some of the world’s leading universities this is especially true in france where we are headquartered in  we decided that we wanted to make a direct contribution to research efforts in areas beyond our direct interests but in an area that we understand and are passionate about we therefore created the cfm foundation for research the foundation’s activities are as follows the financing of three to five theses per year in exact sciences on varying themes eg physics mathematics economics theoretical biology the scholarships total € per year each  of which will allow the student to travel present their results to international conferences or to spend time in a foreign lab sponsorship of international exchanges between researchers providing assistance in the publication of papers and theses helping with the organization or participation in symposiums or conferences financing of research projects in addition we have long been concerned about the growing income gap between commerce and academia and the associated trend of academics prematurely joining the workforce we are helping to address this by offering phd scholarships to the best young scientists enabling them to carry out their doctoral degree without financial concerns the foundation selects recipients according to excellence that of the student the subject and the phd advisor these scholarships are not just available to french students and we hope they will also attract highvalue foreign students for whom there is currently a dearth of available scholarships what we do » cfm what we do absolute return our two flagship investment programs were launched in  and  respectively they are multi award winning and have the objective of achieving consistent returns in variable market conditions with a risk profile that is less volatile than market indices the performance of these programs which is decorrelated from market indices represents our alpha strategies these programs are the zenith of our collective capability and are structured to reflect the fact that achieving a combination of acceptable risk and decorrelation from market indices requires considerable expertise investment and rd capability the strategies in the programs are therefore subject to constant evolution in order to maintain the alpha characteristics and manage decay many of the strategies are based on exploiting medium term days to months inefficiencies in markets and so portfolio turnover is relatively high alternative beta for over  years we have invested in quantitative research and development resulting in the creation of successful absolute return programs a decorrelated strategy alpha is by definition capacity constrained complex and has associated high fees making it attractive to only a small minority of investors mainstream investor appetite for simpler strategies with an attractive fee structure is growing mindful of this and the constraints of the absolute return programs in  we began developing a different type of program which would use the firm’s existing expertise and capital expenditure to appeal to a broader set of investors the programs were launched in  and  with the hallmarks of our quantitative approach but with less complexity some correlation and appropriate fees alternative beta a definition ‘alternative strategies’ have historically been associated with hedge funds on account of the fact that the traded instruments in such strategies are often not ‘traditional’ equities and bonds and the returns profile is often decorrelated from equity and bond benchmarks such strategies have now made their way into more mainstream investment circles but the investment styles continue to be known as ’alternative’ alternative beta is therefore an investment style with returns correlated to these now wellknown alternative benchmarks  and therefore not to traditional equity or bond benchmarks such as the sp  the definition of the alternative benchmark is not as clear cut or accessible as in the case of equity or bond indices but is instead assumed to be a standard implementation of a standard alternative strategy while a strict definition of alternative beta strategies remains elusive various important themes tend to emerge strategies that persist over long periods of time – often decades or even centuries levels of statistical significance need to be sufficiently high to establish strong conviction that the systems are not overfitted  but well anchored in the structure of the markets strategies that are slower moving as opposed to the short term inefficiencies that are generally arbitraged away through time and exploited in an absolute return strategy importantly the slower strategies tend to be scalable to higher capacity strategies that are explainable understandable and plausible alternative beta strategies can generally be split into two types – risk rewarding or so called risk premia  and pure market anomalies often of behavioural origin in short a diversified alternative beta program is a mix of simple welljustified strategies seeking to deliver persistent excess returns with scalable capacity while exhibiting low correlation to traditional equity and fixed income benchmarks cfm product showcase from financial standard               implementation the synergies between the alternative beta and our absolute return programs make for a highly differentiated approach when it comes to implementing the alternative beta strategies and one that shouldn’t be underestimated this differentiation manifests itself in the following ways portfolio construction portfolio construction together with return generation and execution is a vital aspect of building a sound investment program it requires robust data and developed statistical methods which we have honed over many years systematic risk management based on inhouse it infrastructure our itdata infrastructure built over two decades at a cost of more than €m has been specifically designed for quasi real time risk evaluation so while the trading patterns are slower in the alternative beta strategy regular updates of positions and market condition indicators are important in building a reliable risk control infrastructure robust operational risk control the monitoring and management of operational risk at all levels in the production chain is important while operational risk monitoring tools are embedded in the trading systems and maintained by the front office teams we also maintain a dedicated independent risk team reporting directly to our firm’s directors whose mandate is to independently validate financial risk estimates and to independently impose operational risk limits industrialized largescale data processing our data team comprised of approximately  it engineers is responsible for collecting cleaning manipulating and managing terabytes of incoming data every day our data sets range from pricerelated information eg prices implied volatilities to fundamentals eg corporate financial statements and nonfinancial information for trading ideas that exploit idiosyncratic marketspecific inefficiencies given the lower turnover of alternative beta strategies achieving statistical significance is facilitated by the longest back tests possible timeseries data for futures and equities extends back at least to the s and s and where possible we also maintain certain data series as far back as  eg monthly data for many indices commodities bonds and various interest rates we currently monitor approximately one million instruments the importance of minimizing costs controlling trading costs in the implementation of any strategy is critical our dedicated execution research team manages our infrastructure and seeks to model measure and reduce costs we have an extensive database of the execution of our own trades data which is not commercially available and which provides valuable insight into the dynamics of price impact
