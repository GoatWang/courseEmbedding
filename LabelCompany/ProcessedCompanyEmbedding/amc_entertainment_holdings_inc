open over the next  to  months over the longer term the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of  to  per year from almost the very start the wellpublicized financial strains on planet hollywood hindered the project the only planet movies location to actually open a  screen megaplex did so in the summer of  at easton town center in columbus ohio the location was also located alongside an official all star café and planet hollywood restaurant the continued poor financial performance of planet hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in december  and even before the first location had opened stated that the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the columbus site is completed as planet hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in october  their reorganization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from sideventures like planet movies and their cool planet ice cream chain the planet hollywood restaurant and all star café in columbus were closed in late  and the film memorabilia were also removed from the theater as it was rebranded amc easton  and continues to operate the planet movies by

the nordic and baltic area was sold to amc for approximately  million the deal is expected to be finalized during the first half of  upon clearance from the european commission controversiesedit the early versions of stadiumstyle seating as built in  had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area in front of the screen for wheelchair users persons sitting there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen ablebodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable lineofsight with the screen since some wheelchair users may have limited neck movement range this configuration made amc a popular target for americans with disabilities act ada lawsuits amc subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building fullstadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal lineofsight however the us department of justice sued the company and obtained an order requiring amc to retrofit over  screens in  multiplexes and megaplexes across the united states the company successfully appealed the order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which ruled on december   that the order was grossly overboard and violated amcs due process rights under the constitution of the united states amc won by pointing out that the united states access board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require theaters to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen therefore the court ruled that it was unfair to amc to retroactively hold it to a standard

 screens planned to open over the next  to  months over the longer term the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of  to  per year from almost the very start the wellpublicized financial strains on planet hollywood hindered the project the only planet movies location to actually open a  screen megaplex did so in the summer of  at easton town center in columbus ohio the location was also located alongside an official all star café and planet hollywood restaurant the continued poor financial performance of planet hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in december  and even before the first location had opened stated that the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the columbus site is completed as planet hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in october  their reorganization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from sideventures like planet movies and their cool planet ice cream chain the

controversiesedit the early versions of stadiumstyle seating as built in  had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area in front of the screen for wheelchair users persons sitting there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen ablebodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable lineofsight with the screen since some wheelchair users may have limited neck movement range this configuration made amc a popular target for americans with disabilities act ada lawsuits amc subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building fullstadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal lineofsight however the us department of justice sued the company and obtained an order requiring amc to retrofit over  screens in  multiplexes and megaplexes across the united states the company successfully appealed the order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which ruled on december   that the order was grossly overboard and violated amcs due process rights under the constitution of the united states amc won by pointing out that the united states access board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require theaters to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen therefore the court ruled that it was unfair to amc to retroactively hold it to a standard which did not exist at the time it began building stadiumstyle theaters main competitorsedit kansas portal missouri portal companies portal regal entertainment

 screens planned to open over the next  to  months over the longer term the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of  to  per year from almost the very start the wellpublicized financial strains on planet hollywood hindered the project the only planet movies location to actually open a  screen megaplex did so in the summer of  at easton town center in columbus ohio the location was also located alongside an official all star café and planet hollywood restaurant the continued poor financial performance of planet hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in december  and even before the first location had opened stated that the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the columbus site is completed as planet hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in october  their reorganization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from sideventures like planet movies and their cool planet ice cream chain the

controversiesedit the early versions of stadiumstyle seating as built in  had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area in front of the screen for wheelchair users persons sitting there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen ablebodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable lineofsight with the screen since some wheelchair users may have limited neck movement range this configuration made amc a popular target for americans with disabilities act ada lawsuits amc subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building fullstadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal lineofsight however the us department of justice sued the company and obtained an order requiring amc to retrofit over  screens in  multiplexes and megaplexes across the united states the company successfully appealed the order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which ruled on december   that the order was grossly overboard and violated amcs due process rights under the constitution of the united states amc won by pointing out that the united states access board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require theaters to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen therefore the court ruled that it was unfair to amc to retroactively hold it to a standard which did not exist at the time it began building stadiumstyle theaters main competitorsedit kansas portal missouri portal companies portal regal entertainment

could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff the industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant increase in profits the concept also provided more film choices at one location drawing bigger crowds it also gave owners the

pleasure island now disney springs was to be the first planet movies location after the initial seven the jointventure planned to own and operate all subsequent units including  to  complexes with  to  screens planned to open over the next  to  months over the longer term the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of  to  per year from almost the very start the wellpublicized financial strains on planet hollywood hindered the project the only planet movies location to actually open a  screen megaplex did so in the summer of  at easton town center in columbus ohio the location was also located alongside an official all star café and planet hollywood restaurant the continued poor financial performance of planet hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in december  and even before the first location had opened stated that the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the columbus site is completed as planet hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in october  their reorganization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from sideventures like planet movies and their cool planet ice cream chain the planet hollywood restaurant and all star café in columbus were closed in late  and the film memorabilia were also removed from the theater as it was rebranded amc easton  and continues to operate the

controversiesedit the early versions of stadiumstyle seating as built in  had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area in front of the screen for wheelchair users persons sitting there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen ablebodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable lineofsight with the screen since some wheelchair users may have limited neck movement range this configuration made amc a popular target for americans with disabilities act ada lawsuits amc subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building fullstadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal lineofsight however the us department of justice sued the company and obtained an order requiring amc to retrofit over  screens in  multiplexes and megaplexes across the united states the company successfully appealed the order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which ruled on december   that the order was grossly overboard and violated amcs due process rights under the constitution of the united states amc won by pointing out that the united states access board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require theaters to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen therefore the court ruled that it was unfair to amc to retroactively hold it to a standard which did not exist at the time it began building stadiumstyle theaters main competitorsedit kansas portal missouri portal companies portal regal entertainment

belief that every customer was a guest under its new name amc opened the twoscreen parkway twin theatre in a shopping center on kansas citys ward parkway in  this marked the companys first foray into using the multiplex model according to variety stanley durwood later claimed in  that he was standing in the lobby of his seat roxy in kansas city mulling over its poor grosses when he realized he could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff the industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant increase in profits the concept also provided more film choices at one location drawing bigger crowds it also gave owners the flexibility to show big hits on more screens and less reliance on any individual film that could turn out as a bust the amc empire  theatre in times square new york city by the s the company was

 screens planned to open over the next  to  months over the longer term the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of  to  per year from almost the very start the wellpublicized financial strains on planet hollywood hindered the project the only planet movies location to actually open a  screen megaplex did so in the summer of  at easton town center in columbus ohio the location was also located alongside an official all star café and planet hollywood restaurant the continued poor financial performance of planet hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in december  and even before the first location had opened stated that the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the columbus site is completed as planet hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in october  their reorganization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from sideventures like planet movies and their cool planet ice cream chain the

controversiesedit the early versions of stadiumstyle seating as built in  had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area in front of the screen for wheelchair users persons sitting there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen ablebodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable lineofsight with the screen since some wheelchair users may have limited neck movement range this configuration made amc a popular target for americans with disabilities act ada lawsuits amc subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building fullstadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal lineofsight however the us department of justice sued the company and obtained an order requiring amc to retrofit over  screens in  multiplexes and megaplexes across the united states the company successfully appealed the order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which ruled on december   that the order was grossly overboard and violated amcs due process rights under the constitution of the united states amc won by pointing out that the united states access board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require theaters to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen therefore the court ruled that it was unfair to amc to retroactively hold it to a standard which did not exist at the time it began building stadiumstyle theaters main competitorsedit kansas portal missouri portal companies portal regal entertainment

could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff the industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant increase in profits the concept also provided more film choices at one location drawing bigger crowds it also gave owners the

 screens planned to open over the next  to  months over the longer term the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of  to  per year from almost the very start the wellpublicized financial strains on planet hollywood hindered the project the only planet movies location to actually open a  screen megaplex did so in the summer of  at easton town center in columbus ohio the location was also located alongside an official all star café and planet hollywood restaurant the continued poor financial performance of planet hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in december  and even before the first location had opened stated that the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the columbus site is completed as planet hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in october  their reorganization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from sideventures like planet movies and their cool planet ice cream chain the

controversiesedit the early versions of stadiumstyle seating as built in  had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area in front of the screen for wheelchair users persons sitting there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen ablebodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable lineofsight with the screen since some wheelchair users may have limited neck movement range this configuration made amc a popular target for americans with disabilities act ada lawsuits amc subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building fullstadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal lineofsight however the us department of justice sued the company and obtained an order requiring amc to retrofit over  screens in  multiplexes and megaplexes across the united states the company successfully appealed the order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which ruled on december   that the order was grossly overboard and violated amcs due process rights under the constitution of the united states amc won by pointing out that the united states access board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require theaters to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen therefore the court ruled that it was unfair to amc to retroactively hold it to a standard which did not exist at the time it began building stadiumstyle theaters main competitorsedit kansas portal missouri portal companies portal regal entertainment

could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff the industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant increase in profits the concept also provided more film choices at one location drawing bigger crowds it also gave owners the

by amc venture planned to open complexes worldwide with the objective of having icon locations in major metropolitan and other select areas like orlando and columbus initially seven existing unnamed

include markets such as orlando florida the amc pleasure island  megaplex in orlando situated directly across from planet hollywoods most successful restaurant and retail unit and adjacent to disneys pleasure island now disney springs was to be the first planet movies location after the initial seven the jointventure planned to own and operate all subsequent units including  to  complexes with  to  screens planned to open over the next  to  months over the longer term the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of  to  per year from almost the very start the wellpublicized financial strains on planet hollywood hindered the project the only planet movies location to actually open a  screen megaplex did so in the summer of  at easton town center in columbus ohio the location was also located alongside an official all star café and planet hollywood restaurant the continued poor financial performance of planet hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in december  and even before the first location had opened stated that the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the columbus site is completed as planet hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in october  their reorganization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from sideventures like planet movies and their cool planet ice cream chain the planet hollywood restaurant and all star café in columbus were closed in late  and the film memorabilia were also removed from the theater as it was rebranded amc easton  and continues to operate the

controversiesedit the early versions of stadiumstyle seating as built in  had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area in front of the screen for wheelchair users persons sitting there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen ablebodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable lineofsight with the screen since some wheelchair users may have limited neck movement range this configuration made amc a popular target for americans with disabilities act ada lawsuits amc subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building fullstadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal lineofsight however the us department of justice sued the company and obtained an order requiring amc to retrofit over  screens in  multiplexes and megaplexes across the united states the company successfully appealed the order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which ruled on december   that the order was grossly overboard and violated amcs due process rights under the constitution of the united states amc won by pointing out that the united states access board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require theaters to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen therefore the court ruled that it was unfair to amc to retroactively hold it to a standard which did not exist at the time it began building stadiumstyle theaters main competitorsedit kansas portal missouri portal companies portal regal entertainment
