back to case studies case studies michael and brenda miles michael and brenda miles joined the coaching program program in june of  having a slight knowledge of ecommerce business both michael and brenda were ready to learn everything it was going to take for them to succeed in regards to why they joined the program michael claimed “if something were to happen to me there wouldn’t be anything to help support my wife and family i needed to make something work that’s where the coaching program came in” michael’s field of expertise is in programming and industrial controls he and his wife own and operate their own business in that field before coming to the coaching program they had sold a few items on ebay but never really thought much of making it be a main source of income after speaking with their coach they felt confident to list a few items that they had around the house during this process they built up the means to start listing some of the items that their own personal business was not in need of by listing some of the aftermarket items and slightly used products from their company they were able to generate an income above their expectations michael and brenda then started listing on average  items a week on ebay they found that listing their items so that they ended on the weekend was perfect for their industry all of their buyers were factories that by the end of the week were coming to purchase replacement parts that they had michael and brenda also started researching popular keyword phrases for their items and putting as much detail into their ebay descriptions so that their listings would be as professional as possible while performing this process they were able to generate around  in the first few months of operation this was far beyond what they imagined would happen michael simply stated “we had a lot of things to get rid of so that’s what we were using” after they had mastered the idea of listing on ebay michael and brenda also started listing items on classified sections by following the same methods as they did with ebay they were able to use classified ads as a means of creating another steady stream of income by the end of their first  months they had a feedback score on ebay of  enough income to return their investment from the coaching program and a knowledge of ecommerce business that will be able to support them for years to come now the couple is taking on the next stages of their business and creating an online ecommerce website with the help of their coach and the confidence gained they are right on track for what michael was originally looking for the peace of mind that his family would be supported   what we dotestimonialssample sitescoachesdue diligenceabout uscontact us copyright 0 elearning all rights
