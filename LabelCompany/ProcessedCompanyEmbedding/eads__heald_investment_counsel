how often will you call me and how often will you correspond with me regarding my account do you manage bonds are you regulated what are your professional affiliations why should i hire eads  heald investment counsel as my portfolio manager rather than investing in mutual funds mutual funds can be fine in certain situations however with load funds your fees can be higher than with noload funds eads  healds fee is quite competitive with the cost of using the average noload mutual fund with noload funds you may not have someone with whom to discuss your personal portfolio needs unless your asset size is quite large also with mutual funds you have little if any control over realization of capital gains eads  heald investment counsel offers personalized portfolio management service and we are always directly available to our clients you may wish to further review this topic in how client relationships work what type of accounts does eads  heald investment counsel manage eads  heald investment counsel manages money for erisa accounts pension plans profitsharing plans defined benefit plans iras family limited partnerships trust accounts and taxable portfolios generally speaking we manage any investment vehicle for which stocks andor bonds are appropriate we manage such accounts on behalf of corporations partnerships municipalities endowments foundations and individual investors

a brokerage firm of your choice you give the custodian written permission allowing us to trade assets in your account what options do i have for paying my quarterly fee to eads  heald investment

your account and pays us by check in this instance you will still receive a copy of the bill for your records will you negotiate your fee we do not negotiate our fees the one exception is when we are presented to a prospective client by a brokerage firm as part of a wrap fee package what is your minimum account size our minimum account size is  the exception to this is a lower minimum in certain wrap fee programs through various brokerage firms or other referral sources will eads  heald investment counsel help me define and implement an overall financial plan eads  heald investment counsel is a portfolio management firm in addition eads  heald can assist with retirement spending and planning goals with regard to our investment relationship with our clients we will want to be aware of your overall financial situation in order to feel comfortable that the portion of your assets that we manage generally makes sense for you we will prepare a statement of investment objectives that addresses the portfolios we manage on your behalf  in this manner we can assist with common financial planning needs to a helpful degree will you obtain my approval before making security transactions in my account no obtaining client approval for trades is tantamount to both client and manager managing the account this process simply does not work your specific investment objectives will be set forth in a written statement of investment objectives we will abide by those objectives in managing your account however daytoday involvement by the client in managing the account is counterproductive what input do i have in the construction of my portfolio we prepare a written statement of investment objectives for your approval before we begin managing your portfolio in your statement of investment objectives you can delineate specific companies or industries you do not want to own if you so choose if you have liquidity income or asset mix needs those should be addressed as well beyond that we need to be free to manage the portfolio as appropriate in an attempt to meet your longterm investment goals  you can revise your written objectives anytime can i control when and how much capital gains i realize in general it is better to manage a portfolio for fundamental reasons and let capital gains take care of themselves of necessity think of some percent of your realized capital gains as going toward taxes a portfolio can become convoluted if one has an extreme focus on minimizing capital gains nevertheless our investment philosophy lends itself to minimizing tax consequences given our low portfolio turnover and emphasis on growth rather than dividends how many stocks will i own the number of stocks owned will depend somewhat on the size of your portfolio in periods where we believe the stock market is high we may want to own more stocks to achieve greater diversification unlike many portfolios managed by individuals we will own many more than five ten or fifteen stocks what is your investment time horizon we are longterm investors we look out three to five to ten years and longer if your primary focus is on six to twenty four months or so we would not be a good fit for you what is your asset turnover ratio once a new portfolio has been traded to reflect our investment philosophy our security turnover is generally quite low  to  annual turnover with a  turnover you are holding the average stock for five years of course in reality you might hold some stocks for much longer or shorter periods some of our trading is done in order to reduce oversized positions caused by certain stocks doing very well will an individual or team manage my account each portfolio will have an assigned manager all of our portfolio managers are working within the same corporate investment philosophy so longerterm results will be very similar regardless of who is actually assigned to your accounts how often will you call me and how often will you correspond with me regarding my account quarterly we will send you a formal review letter covering your portfolio and our outlook for the future  we are also available to discuss items at any time  we tend to not initiate calls  we view our clients as busy smart and successful people who will call us when they want something do you manage bonds we do not manage pure bond portfolios but do manage balanced portfolios containing both stocks and bonds the bonds can be corporate government agency or municipal bonds we are bond investors and generally do not attempt shortterm swapping we prefer highquality bonds and typically like to stay under  years in maturity are you regulated yes we are regulated by the us securities and exchange commission sec if you would like a copy of our sec filing form adv please contact us what are your professional affiliations the principals of eads  heald investment counsel hold the chartered financial analyst cfa designation all portfolio managers also hold the cfa
