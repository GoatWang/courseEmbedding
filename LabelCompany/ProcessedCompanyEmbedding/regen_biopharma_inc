biopharma inc receives fda clearance to initiate clinical trial of hemaxellerate company to initiate phase i clinical trial for immune modulatory personalized cell therapy in treatment of aplastic anemia dec    et from regen biopharma inc san diego california december   prnewswire  regen biopharma inc otcbb rgbp and pink rgbp announced today receipt of a communication from the us food and drug administration allowing for initiation of clinical trials under its investigational new drug ind    the clearance of the ind allows the company to initiate clinical trials of hemaxellerate a personalized immunemodulatory cell therapy that has demonstrated benefit in animal models of aplastic anemia   aplastic anemia a condition that occurs when the body stops producing enough blood cells is a potentially fatal disease of the bone marrow that leads to bleeding infection and fever severe and very severe aplastic anemia can have a mortality rate of greater than  and are considered a hematologic emergency  current treatments include blood transfusions immunosuppression and stem cell transplantation the companys initial phase i clinical trial will treat patients having refractory aplastic anemia  aplastic anemia patients who havent responded to firstline immunosuppressive therapy  with hemaxellerate and follow them for safety parameters and signals of efficacy therapeutic effects will be quantified based on immunological and hematological measurements because the trial will be unblinded data will be available as the study progresses current drugbased approaches for healing bone marrow dysfunction involve flooding the body with growth factors which is extremely expensive and causes unintended consequences because of lack of selectivity said harry lander phd president and chief scientific officer of regen biopharma by utilizing a cellbased approach that both modulates the immune system and stimulates production of blood cells we aim to offer alternatives to the current approaches to treating patients with aplastic anemia this product will complement our immunemodulatory pipeline that includes a potential novel checkpoint inhibitor if the clinical trial is successful the company plans to expand the use of hemaxellerate to other conditions associated with bone marrow dysfunction with the overall goal of entering the hematopoietic growth factor market this market is substantial in size and currently includes drugs such as neupogen® neulasta® leukine® and revolade®  the fda clearance marks a substantial step for regen in that we are now a clinicalstage company  we are grateful to our collaborators and scientific advisory board members who have worked tirelessly in bringing our product to the point where the fda has permitted treatment of patients said david koos phd chairman and chief executive officer of regen biopharma we believe the success of today will not only allow for the rapid execution of hemaxellerates development plan

fda on dcellvax genesilenced breast cancer immunotherapy company advances development of second generation immunooncology cellular drug sep    et from regen biopharma inc san diego california september   prnewswire  regen biopharma inc otcqb rgbp otcqb rgbpp announced today submission to the food and drug administration fda of a revised investigational new drug ind application focused on using a novel method to unleash the bodys innate ability to kill cancer  the package submitted contained preclinical experiments as well as details of the proposed clinical trial  results of the studies clearly demonstrated that the approach outlined using sirna to silence a key enzyme related to inhibition of the immune system is effective at stimulating the type of immune response associated with known checkpoint inhibitors the enzyme silenced is indoleamine dioxygenase ido  an enzyme that is overexpressed in some cancers and which suppresses immune system response against the cancer the company believes it has supplied the additional data and clarifications the fda requested because dcellvax is a personalized cell therapy product aimed at activating the immune system of patients with metastatic breast cancer we are excited to potentially have a product to deliver to patients who at the moment have no other options said dr david koos ceo of regen biopharma dcellvax is comprised of cells extracted from the patients own circulating immune cells and processed using a proprietary method so as to activate these immune cells in such a way that they can attack cancer cells    studies in animal and human immune cells by regen and other groups have shown that the cells in dcellvax are highly active and secrete the same cytokines that immune cells known to kill cancer cells do  thus we are optimistic that this treatment will be useful in patients with cancer the proposed dcellvax clinical trial involves generation of patientspecific immune stimulatory cells termed dendritic cells that are modified by genesilencing so as to lose expression of the immune checkpoint gene ido  ten patients with advanced breast cancer will be treated in the proposed clinical trial dcellvax is one of the programs we are developing to activate the immune system in order to allow the body to kill cancer   immune modulation both inhibitory and stimulatory is unlocking many novel ways to have the human body heal itself  dcellvax is only one of our immune modulatory products that we expect to bring to market in the future  the data package we sent to the fda is an important step in this process said harry lander phd mba president and chief scientific officer of regen biopharma about regen biopharma inc  regen biopharma inc is a publicly traded biotechnology company otcqb rgbp and otcqb rgbpp the company seeks to identify undervalued regenerative medicine applications in the immunotherapy and stem cell space the company is focused on rapidly advancing

with fda cellular specialists to finalize the animal safety studies in a glp laboratory hemaxellerate i is a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow hemaxellarate i utilizes a collection of cells harvested from the patient’s own adipose fat tissue to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells  the initial application of hemaxellerate i will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia a rare and serious condition in which the bone marrow fails to make enough blood cells red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in practice the physician is shipped a kit which is used to collect adipose tissue the tissue is sent to a processing facility and a standardized cellular product is delivered in a readytouse manner for administration into the patient

the preclinical stage of development for dcellvax and plans to file an investigational new drug application in fall  the dcellvax therapeutic product is based on extracting blood from patients growing a specialized type of immune cell from the blood called the dendritic cell and then subsequently genetically modifying the dendritic cell to become resistant to cancers immune suppressive activity it is known that cancer modifies the immune system by producing proteins which result in immune suppression one such protein which cancer stimulates is an enzyme indolamine  deoxygenase ido which cancer turns on in dendritic cells while dendritic cells are usually immune stimulators dendritic cells found in cancer patients suppress the immune system as a result of expressing ido the dcellvax therapeutic product uses patents that regen biopharma has inlicensed from dr weiping min coupled with patents inlicensed from benitec biopharma  by utilizing methods covered in both of these patents regen biopharma hopes to develop an immunebased nontoxic cancer treatment initially targeting breast cancer hemaxellerate ii™ regen biopharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for hemaxellerate ii hemaxellerate ii is intended to be a universal donor endothelial cell based therapeutic and is intended to be manufactured by obtaining cells from a part of the placenta called the “vascular lobules” the cells are processed and utilized for the purpose of stimulating bone marrow hematopoetic stem cell repair and proliferation the mechanism of action for hemaxellerate ii is similar to hemaxellerate i whereby the harvested and processed cells would produce growth factors which would mediate the therapeutic effects of the product   cancer treatment via sirna and innate immune system stimulation     new  regen biopharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for this treatment  a patent application was filed for this novel cancer treatment on  this

avocel in  financial constraints caused the company to shutter research operations in upon raising venture capital tacere therapeutics acquired the rights to the hcv family of drugs and brought back dr suhy to head the program partnered with pfizer shortly thereafter this drug is their first foray into gene therapybased approaches and is the first shrna program partnered with a large pharma given pfizer’s lack of experience in both areas dr suhy has played a pivotal role in its development as tacere has continued to lead the research efforts for advancement of this product into the clinic and has stood sidebyside with pfizer through all of the regulatory agency meetings     current business partners  regen biopharma

pressreleasesfranklyinccomsource regen biopharma incnovel activators demonstrate selective inhibition of ila and ilsan diego july   prnewswire regen biopharma inc otcqb rgbp and otcqb rgbpp today reported continued progress in regens development of small molecule drugs that activate and inhibit nrf the company reports that recently identified novel chemical compounds that activate nrf also selectively inhibit cytokines secreted from activated immune cells this indicates that researchers have identified a compound that appears to be effective in treating autoimmune diseases with virtually no toxicity research was conducted by chemdiv inc an internationally recognized contract research organization which has been retained by regen to conduct research and experiments on regens behalfthe nrf nuclear receptor has been identified as a potentially very important immune cell inhibitor an immune checkpoint and cancer stem cell differentiator the nrf program at regen aims to identify antagonists of nrf in an effort to unleash the cancerkilling potential of a patients own immune system as well as identifying agonists which should suppress the immune system in diseases where the immune system is overactivated such as autoimmunitywe tested three recentlyidentified agonists which share a privileged structure for their ability to inhibit cytokine production in stimulated immune cells says harry lander phd mba president and chief scientific officer of regen after stimulating the immune cells in the presence or absence of our compounds we measured the cytokines il ilß tnfa ifn and ila which are wellknown to mediate many inflammatory and autoimmunerelated diseases remarkably our compounds inhibited ila and il had a modest effect on tnfa and had no effect on il ß and ifn secretion this gives us insight into the mechanism of action of these drugs and paves the way forward for optimizing these compoundswith this important series of experiments we have significantly derisked the agonist program says david koos phd chairman  ceo regen biopharma inc what this really means is the company has identified a number of compounds that modulate checkpoint nrf recent developments show  compound groups that appear to be turbocharged in the way they modulate nrf the company believes that these recent  compound groups just need some finetuning to be the basis for our autoimmune therapies additionally using this information we are now able to ramp up our inhibitor program which focuses on anticancer drugsabout regen biopharma inc  regen
