facility reports  reserves and production    fourth quarter exit rate in excess of  boe per day   reserves increase  to  million boe   closed new bank facility  million initial borrowing base   earnings conference call scheduled for march      denver colorado – february   – resolute energy corporation “resolute” or the “company” nyse ren today provided detail on its yearend  reserves and production   rick betz resolute’s chief executive officer commented “during  resolute produced an average of nearly  boe per day above the high end of guidance more importantly the  exit rate was more than  boe per day with more than  boe per day or  percent coming from the permian basin in addition to exceeding our production guidance resolute also met or beat the midpoint of guidance for lease operating expense and production taxes and was within the guidance range on general and administrative expense   “on february   we closed a new revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of  million  coupled with our projected cash flow we expect that this credit facility and borrowing base will provide ample liquidity to undertake and complete our two rig  delaware basin drilling program also effective today moodys investors service upgraded resolute’s corporate family rating to b from caa with a stable outlook   “proved reserves increased by  percent from yearend  largely due to our successful  delaware basin drilling program and despite using lower sec commodity prices in  yearend  proved reserves were  mmboe of which  percent was crude oil and natural gas liquids yearend reserves reflect the addition of  mmboe of proved reserves the pretax sec pv of our proved reserves at yearend  was  million a nongaap financial measure and the aftertax value was  million both metrics are up  percent from yearend ”   new bank facility   on february   the company closed on its amended and restated revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of  million an increase from the previous level of  million  in addition the maturity date of the facility was extended to february  and certain other terms and conditions were modified including those to reflect the fact that the company extinguished its second lien term loan facility in january   bank of montreal is the administrative agent under the new revolving credit facility as of the date of this release we have no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility   operations update   in december we brought on line the harrison c h a midlength wolfcamp a lateral in mustang  in midjanuary as planned we added a second drilling rig in the delaware basin       one rig is drilling in mustang and the other is drilling in appaloosa  since the first of the year we have drilled the south elephant u h a long lateral wolfcamp a in appaloosa and the harpoon lh a midlength lateral wolfcamp a in mustang both of these wells are waiting on completion  also we completed the renegade lh and renegade uh wells both midlength wolfcamp a laterals in mustang both of which are flowing back  the renegade wells are our first upper and lower wolfcamp a downspacing test     yearend  proved reserves   at december   resolutes estimated proved reserves were  mmboe compared to yearend  proved reserves of  mmboe approximately  percent of the companys  yearend proved reserves was crude oil  percent was gas and  percent was natural gas liquids undeveloped reserves comprised  percent of total proved reserves   the present value of the companys estimated future net revenues from proved reserves was estimated to be  million pretax a nongaap financial measure and  million aftertax as of december   using sec pricing guidelines for yearend  discounted at ten percent pricing used in calculating the yearend  present value of our reserves was  per barrel of oil and  per mmbtu of gas  for the prior yearend report pricing was  per barrel of oil and  per mmbtu of gas  all prices were adjusted for differentials and ngl content and the analysis excluded the impact of hedges   the increase in proved reserves from yearend  to yearend  was largely driven by successful drilling of previously nonproved delaware basin locations both operated and nonoperated new well completions and acquisitions of additional interests in mustang yielded additions of  mmboe of net proved developed producing reserves and  mmboe of net proved undeveloped reserves in twenty immediate offset delaware basin locations also  mmboe of net proved developed nonproducing and proved undeveloped reserves were added to aneth field in connection with newly identified compression and deepening projects   closed sale of new mexico properties   on february  resolute closed the sale of our new mexico properties that we announced on january    the properties were purchased by a private buyer for  million subject to customary purchase price adjustments the sale is effective as of october   the
