  stearman jeffrey n et al vs centex homes coverage analysis in construction defects home       mold  mildew       list of cases      back to cd      settlement negotiation  stearman jeffrey n et al vs centex homes a defendant builder of mass produced housing may be held strictly liable for construction defects  this question is firmly established in california cases beginning  years ago with kriegler v eichler homes inc   calappd   see inter alia fleck v bollinger home corp   calappth  alcal roofing  insulation v superior court   calappth  becker v mcmillin construction co   calappd  orndorff v christiana community builders   calappd  gem developers v hallcraft homes of san diego inc   calappd  gentry construction co v superior court   calappd  oliver v superior court   calappd  huang v garner   calappd  del mar beach club owners assn v imperial contracting co   calappd  ravens cove townhomes inc v knuppe development co   calappd  stuart v crestview mut water co   calappd  and avner v longridge estates   calappd   the question is whether a plaintiff can recover under strict liability when a defect in one component part of a house causes injury to other component parts of the house but not to persons or property apart from the structure  defendant asserts such damage constitutes nothing more than injury to the product itself a loss for which strict liability compensation is barred by the economic loss rule of seely v white motor co   cald   it argues damage to a defective product itself is simply the products failure to function properly for which the only remedy lies in a warranty action through which the disappointed buyer can seek to recoup the benefit of its bargain  california authorities read together represent a considerable body of law expressly or by implication rejecting defendants assertion that owners whose residences are constructed on defective lots and foundations may not recover in strict liability for resulting physical injury to their homes the court held that the damage plaintiffs sustained to their home is physical injury falling outside the parameters of economic loss and is thus compensable under strict liability in tort   in the court of appeal of the state of california fourth appellate district division three   jeffrey n stearman et al       plaintiffs and appellants                v centex homes       defendant and appellant       g      super ct no       o p i n i o n  appeals from a judgment and orders of the superior court of orange county byron k mcmillan judge  retired judge of the superior court assigned by the chief justice pursuant to article vi section  of the california constitution  judgment affirmed as modified  rodarti feld  gelfer richard g feld and scott h gelfer for plaintiffs and appellants  epsten  grinnell douglas w grinnell and luis e ventura as amicus curiae on behalf of plaintiffs and appellants  morgenstein  jubelirer jean l bertrand and natasha l golding for defendant and appellant  paul b campos gordon  rees douglas b harvey robert v dugoni and david collins as amici curiae on behalf of defendant and appellant  defendant centex homes appeals from a judgment in favor of plaintiffs jeffrey and linda stearman in a strict liability action arising out of defendants defective construction of the foundation of plaintiffs tract home resulting in severe slab movement and deformation  the defects caused extensive cracks throughout the interior and exterior surfaces of the home  the issue is not whether a defendant builder of mass produced housing may be held strictly liable for construction defects  the affirmative answer to that question is firmly established in california cases beginning  years ago with kriegler v eichler homes inc   calappd   see inter alia fleck v bollinger home corp   calappth  alcal roofing  insulation v superior court    calappth  becker v mcmillin construction co   calappd  orndorff v christiana community builders   calappd  gem developers v hallcraft homes of san diego inc   calappd  gentry construction co v superior court   calappd  oliver v superior court   calappd  huang v garner   calappd  del mar beach club owners assn v imperial contracting co   calappd  ravens cove townhomes inc v knuppe development co   calappd  stuart v crestview mut water co   calappd  and avner v longridge estates   calappd    rather the question is whether a plaintiff can recover under strict liability when a defect in one component part of a house causes injury to other component parts of the house but not to persons or property apart from the structure  defendant asserts such damage constitutes nothing more than injury to the product itself a loss for which strict liability compensation is barred by the economic loss rule of seely v white motor co   cald   it argues damage to a defective product itself is simply the products failure to function properly for which the only remedy lies in a warranty action through which the disappointed buyer can seek to recoup the benefit of its bargain   defendant contends the precise issue here has not been directly decided in california but to the extent seely and other appellate courts of this state have touched upon it they have reached the wrong conclusion or are poorly reasoned inapt and nonbinding  we are invited to depart from our own longstanding judicial tradition and in its place adopt the strong majority rule of other jurisdictions which according to defendant have interpreted seely correctly and would prohibit strict liability recovery under the facts of this case  plaintiffs on the other hand assert our own courts have considered the economic loss rule in construction and nonconstruction cases alike and have uniformly allowed recovery of strict liability damages where as here a defect has caused physical damage to the property  they further note a number of other states have applied strict liability to massproduced housing defects and thus california is not the oddball defendant purports it to be  plaintiffs have also filed a crossappeal to which we will turn after concluding our discussion of the appeal   amici curiae expand upon the positions of both parties  from divergent viewpoints they trace the development of the strict liability doctrine in this state and others offering sharply conflicting analyses of a dizzying array of authorities several hundred of them  in the end after having laboriously trudged our way through the labyrinth we do not find this to be a particularly complex or close case  defendants premise that the economic loss rule bars strict liability recovery for physical damage to plaintiffs home is unsupported and indeed contradicted by seely and other california decisions  see international knights of wine inc v ball corp   calappd  and gherna v ford motor co   calappd   moreover we are not convinced the strong majority of other jurisdictions would as defendant claims find plaintiffs confined to a warranty recovery  indeed defendant and its amici could cite no more than six outofstate decisions dealing with analogous facts  our own research confirms the paucity of cases   but it really doesnt matter  the answer lies within our state  california authorities read together represent a considerable body of law expressly or by implication rejecting defendants assertion that owners whose residences are constructed on defective lots and foundations may not recover in strict liability for resulting physical injury to their homes  we step in line with this law in holding the damage plaintiffs sustained to their home is physical injury falling outside the parameters of economic loss and is thus compensable under strict liability in tort facts  defendant is a mass producer of homes in southern california  in february  plaintiffs bought a centex tract house in san clemente  problems with the property began to appear shortly after plaintiffs moved in and continued over the next few years  in  plaintiffs sued the builder stating only one cause of action for strict liability in tort  they alleged defendant constructed the home on inadequately compacted soil causing slab movement and deformation which in turn damaged the structure and yard improvements diminished the propertys value and required plaintiffs to incur expenses for remedial measures including employing various professionals to assess the situation and make recommendations  at trial plaintiffs and their experts testified to postconstruction movement and continuing deformation of the slab foundation which resulted in inter alia  a significant separation between the ceiling and wall joints over the entire length of the house cracks in the drywall throughout virtually every room separation and cracks in tile counters in the bathrooms and kitchen and cracks in the exterior stucco  each of these problems worsened over time  plaintiffs engineering experts opined the slab foundation would have to be replaced  plaintiffs cost estimator testified that replacing the slab  would require emptying out the house disconnecting utility lines removing appliances ripping out floors removing windows and doors and jacking up the structure  after replacement of the slab the house would be lowered onto it and virtually rebuilt  including moving and alternate housing costs for the four months it would take to complete the repairs the total cost would exceed   there is no issue regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the defective construction or resultant damage to the home  however defendant contended throughout the proceedings that the economic loss rule barred plaintiffs from recovering under strict liability when only damages to the product itself were claimed  the court rejected this assertion at every juncture denying defendants motions for nonsuit and directed verdict and refusing defendants proposed special instruction which stated plaintiffs are not permitted to recover damages under a strict liability cause of action for purely economic loss or for mere damage to the product itself   if the only evidence of damages presented by plaintiffs establishes purely economic injury or damage to the product itself resulting in the reduction in fair market value of plaintiffs residence then you may not award damages to plaintiffs  the jury returned a special verdict finding plaintiffs house was defectively constructed causing plaintiffs damages of   defendant then renewed its challenge reprising the same theme in motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial both of which the trial court denied discussion defendants appeal  in seely v white motor co supra  cald  widely recognized as the progenitor of the economic loss rule the court held a commercial trucker who purchased a defective truck was entitled to breach of express warranty damages for lost profits from his heavyduty hauling business and for money paid on the purchase price but could not recover these economic losses under strict product liability  id at pp   tracing the development of warranty and strict liability law the seely court observed warranty grew as a branch of the law of commercial transactions and was primarily aimed at controlling the commercial aspects of these transactions  citations  id at p   it concluded warranty rules function well in a commercial setting  ibid  warranty adequately protected the seely plaintiff a trucker who could have shopped around until he found the truck that would fulfill his business needs and could be fairly charged with the risk that the product would not match his economic expectations unless the manufacturer agreed that it would  id at p  italics added  on the other hand the seely court reasoned strict liability for purely economic losses would unjustifiably expose the manufacturer for damages of unknown and unlimited scope  seely v white motor co supra  cald at p   explaining it observed commercial enterprises have widely varying needs which are ordinarily communicated to the dealer not the manufacturer who would be liable even though it never agreed the product would perform as a particular purchaser needed it to perform  id at pp   in seely for instance the truck proved unsatisfactory for plaintiffs heavyduty hauling business but performed well for the subsequent purchaser who after the dealer made only minor alterations to the truck drove it  miles for a less demanding enterprise  id at pp   for this reason and others which we need not reiterate the court found without an agreement defined by practice or otherwise defendant should not be liable for these commercial losses  id at p  italics added   the seely court did not end its discussion there however  it added a final paragraph regarding plaintiffs contention the trial court erred in denying strict liability recovery for physical damage to the truck itself  significantly the court agreed with plaintiffs argument that even though the law of warranty governs the economic relations between the parties the doctrine of strict liability in tort should be extended to govern physical injury to plaintiffs property as well as personal injury  seely v white motor co supra  cald at p  italics added  the court found physical injury to property is so akin to personal injury that there is no reason to distinguish them  citations  ibid  plaintiff was barred from recovering strict liability damages for physical injury to the truck not by the economic loss rule but only because he failed to prove causation  ibid definition and application of the economic loss rule  the seely court drawing a distinction between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss seely v white motor co supra   cald at p defines the difference primarily by implication  as we have noted the decision contains dicta that had plaintiff proved the truck itself was damaged by the defective condition the truck tended to gallop he could have recovered strict liability damages  id at p    other courts in our jurisdiction have articulated the rule more definitively  for instance huang v garner supra  calappd  instructs economic loss is marked by the loss of the benefit of the bargain for the goods purchased lost profits and replacement costs for ineffective goods  physical damage to property and personal injury however are not considered to be economic loss  id at p  internal citation and quotation marks omitted italics added  in huang it was undisputed    that the court properly drew the line between economic and physical damages determining the cost to repair structural and other alleged defects which had not actually caused physical damage to be economic damage  idat p  italics added   with regard to defects the huang plaintiffs presented evidence that the plans and specifications for the building were defective in several ways including insufficient fire retardation walls insufficient shear walls and inadequate structure      additional evidence indicated that deviation from the building plans during construction also contributed to faulty construction  huang v garner supra  calappd at  p   the plaintiffs sought recovery for physical damages to their property including damages to the structure caused by deflected and cracked beams and dry rot damages to the balcony area  they also sought recovery of economic losses including the cost to repair firewalls shear walls fire stops and other alleged defects in the structure which had not caused actual physical damages at the time of trial  id at pp  italics added  the huang court noted apparently it was agreed by the parties that damages such as the cost to repair allegedly insufficient shear walls insufficient fire retardation and defects in the structure which did not cause actual physical damage were in fact economic damages  id at p    huangs definition and application of the economic loss rule albeit in the context of a negligence theory demonstrates defendant is just plain wrong in contending the physical damage to plaintiffs real property caused by defective construction of the foundation is only an injury to the product itself and thus barred by the economic loss rule of seely  huang does not stand alone  as we will discuss other cases compel the conclusion that under california law the physical damages to plaintiffs property are entirely distinct from economic losses and are thus recoverable in strict liability   in gherna v ford motor co   calappd  the product was an automobile in which defective design or manufacture relating to wiring or placement of the transmission dipstick next to the exhaust manifold caused a fire destroying the vehicle  the court did not suggest the product had injured only itself thus rendering the loss purely economic  rather it found the law settled that the doctrine of strict liability applies to physical harm to person or property  id at p  italics added   anthony v kelseyhayes co   calappd  expands the analysis  the anthony plaintiffs did not seek damages arising out of any personal injury to themselves or any physical damage to their vehicles attributable to the wheels they contended were defective  id at p   rather they sought recovery for  general depreciation in the value of the vehicles which the court categorized as loss of bargain  cost of inspections repairs and replacements of the wheels themselves and  loss of use prior to and during inspections and repairs  id at p  any issue as to the second item was moot because plaintiffs had accepted new wheels from the vehicle manufacturer  ibid  in regard to the third claim the anthony court observed loss of use is an item of incidental damage  it appears appropriate therefore to characterize it according to the nature of the damage of which it is an incident  unless incidental to physical property damage it would appear that it may be properly classified as a type of economic loss  ibid italics added  harkening to seelys call it concluded neither depreciation definitely a complaint that the trucks with defective wheels were not of the quality bargained for nor loss of use could be recovered under strict liability because plaintiffs did not claim either item was caused by physical property damage  id at p   finally the court distinguished the plaintiffs case from gherna and kriegler v eichler homes inc supra  calappd  where strict liability recovery was available because there was ponderable physical property damage to the property sold and purchased  anthony v kelseyhayes co supra  calappd at p  italics added  sacramento regional transit dist v grumman flxible    calappd  grumman sheds additional light on the subject  plaintiff purchased  busses with the manufacturers standard written warranty  id at p   plaintiff discovered a broken fuel tank support during routine maintenance on one of the busses      further inspection of all the busses    revealed that at least     had the same or similar damage ie cracked fuel tank supports  as a result of further inspection plaintiff determined that all the busses it purchased from defendant would likely suffer the same type of damage unless certain remedial repairs were undertaken  ibid  in addition plaintiff found structural defects in the undercarriage battery frame area of certain other busses previously purchased  from defendant      id at p  fn   plaintiff sought strict liability damages based on these latent defects id at p   the grumman court began its analysis stating strict liability is imposed not only where the defective product causes personal injury but also where the defective product causes physical damage to property  citations  the damaged property may consist of the product itself  citing seely international knights of wine inc v ball corp   calappd   ikw and gherna v ford motor co supra  calappd at p   sacramento regional transit dist v grumman flxible supra  calappd at p  italics added  it further noted however where damage consists solely of economic losses recovery on a theory of products liability is precluded  citations  id at pp    the grumman court observed the line between physical injury to property and economic loss reflects the line of demarcation between tort theory and contract theory  sacramento regional transit dist v grumman flxible supra   calappd at p   noting plaintiff did not claim any physical injury to the busses apart from the manifestation of the defect itself ibid it found the expenses plaintiff had incurred and would incur for repair of the defects was not recoverable in strict liability which presupposes  a defect and  further damage to plaintiffs property caused by the defect  ibid original italics  for lack of the requisite damage to the property apart from the defect the court concluded plaintiffs repair costs were purely economic damages  ibid  responding to plaintiffs reliance on gherna and ikw supra the court distinguished both cases  the gherna plaintiff had avoided a nonsuit by presenting sufficient evidence that defective wiring or a design defect consisting of the improper juxtaposition of component enginetransmission parts caused a fire which damaged plaintiffs automobile  sacramento regional transit district v grumman flxible supra  calappd at p  italics added  the grumman court impliedly agreed with the gherna courts conclusion that products liability affords a remedy to one whose property has been physically injured and    the remedy is available where the property injured is the defective product  ibid  moreover ikw was distinguishable because the plaintiff there alleged that due to defective caps or defective application of caps the wine became unusable and economic loss was incurred  sacramento regional transit district v grumman flxible supra  calappd at p  internal quotations marks and citation omitted  the grumman court added to the extent that ikw may stand for the proposition that a merchant may sue in products liability for physical injury to its property where that injury consists of nothing more than the product defect upon which liability is founded we decline to follow it  ibid italics added  the case of san francisco unified school dist v wr grace  co   calappth  grace presented the issue in the hybrid context of a statute of limitations question regarding plaintiffs ability to state a claim arising from the presence of asbestos materials used in construction of the school building  noting the limitations period did not begin to run until damage occurred the court considered what constitutes the element of damage for purposes of strict liability and negligence  id at p   it stated until physical injury occurs  until damage rises above the level of mere economic loss  a plaintiff cannot state a cause of action for strict liability or negligence  ibid fn omitted   alluding to the rule enunciated in seely the grace court defined economic loss as  the diminution in value of the product because it is inferior in quality and does not work for the general purposes for which it was manufactured and sold     it generally means pecuniary damage that occurs through loss of value or use of the goods sold or the cost of repair together with consequential lost profits when there has been no claim of personal injury or damage to other property  san francisco unified school dist v wr grace  co supra  calappth at p  fn  internal quotation marks italics and citations omitted  it explained that under seely the reduction of fair market value of buildings found to contain asbestos building materials may constitute an economic loss that cannot be recovered in tort in a strict liability or negligence action  under the seely analysis no physical harm to persons or property has yet occurred  only unrecoverable economic losses  ibid  summarizing asbestosinbuilding cases from all over the country the grace court noted the issue presented itself in two distinct situations  cases involving the mere presence of asbestos in the buildings and those in which asbestos contamination had occurred  san francisco unified school district v wr grace  co supra   calappth at pp   it noted in the latter category jurisdictions that adopt seelys physical injuryeconomic loss distinction routinely find that asbestos contamination constitutes the physical injury element of strict liability or negligence causes of action      the injury for which asbestos plaintiffs are being recompensed has been found to be the contamination of their buildings not the mere presence of asbestos  ibid  it concluded in order to be consistent with the principles of seely it appears that until contamination occurs the only damages that arise are economic losses that do not constitute physical injury to property recoverable in strict liability  physical injury resulting from asbestos contamination not the mere presence of asbestos must have occurred before a cause of action for strict liability    can accrue      id at p   although there is a generous supply of other authorities illustrating the difference between physical damage and economic loss a brief notation regarding one more recent decision should be sufficient to hammer the point home  casey v overhead door corp   calappth  involved inter alia defectively constructed windows in a residential tract  plaintiffs argued the trial court had improperly precluded their cost estimator expert from testifying to certain damages  the casey court noted  the ruling had correctly barred testimony regarding economic losses ie the removal and replacement of the windows but it had not prevented plaintiffs from eliciting testimony regarding damages which were not economic losses ie the physical damage caused by the defective windows to the drywall and framing and the resultant insect infestation and damage to personal property  casey v overhead door corp supra  calappth at p   for some unknown reason plaintiffs had simply stipulated that the cost estimator would not testify that repair would include new drywall new framing and removal of the insects  id at p   the reviewing court found appellants bound by the admission they had no evidence to support a claim for any measure of damages other than economic loss  ibid  against the background of these decisions it becomes abundantly clear the case before us does not in the strict sense present an issue of first impression  courts of this state have fully examined the economic loss rule drawn the line of demarcation between such loss and physical injury to property including to the defective product itself and allowed recovery of strict liability damages in the latter instance  of course as defendant accurately notes some cases have apparently assumed physical damages were recoverable  see for instance kriegler v eichler homes inc supra  calappd  californias cornerstone strict liability construction case permitting recovery of strict liability damages where defectivelyfabricated radiant heat tubes installed in substandard concrete slab of plaintiffs residence caused failure of the heating system emergency and permanent repairs removal of storage and furniture and the need for plaintiff and his family to find temporary replacement shelter avner v longridge estates supra  calappd  no physical injury but strict liability recovery permissible where portion of rear slope of plaintiffs tract lot failed twice lot pad upon which home was built settled due to improper soil compaction and inadequate drainage and only apparent injury was to the property stuart v crestview mut water co supra  calappd  plaintiffs could maintain strict liability action and recover for loss of home and orchard destroyed in fire as a result of a developers failure to design and install a system which could deliver an adequate supply and flow of water  but the fact that these and like cases have not directly discussed the economic lossphysical injury to property dichotomy does not lessen the import of the cases which have  indeed the assumption that physical damages to the property are recoverable tends to reinforce rather than undermine our conclusion regarding the state of the law in california  we will not belabor the obvious by engaging in the intellectual nitpicking defendant presses upon us  moreover it would it serve no purpose to examine the decisions of other jurisdictions or plumb the niceties of the restatement fourth of torts products liability section  or its predecessor  here there is no dispute the defectively constructed foundation resulted in slab movement and deformation causing physical damage to plaintiffs property ie cracks all over the residence  in light of the these facts the authorities we have discussed and the supreme courts repeated citing of kriegler see eg peterson v superior court   calth   becker v irm corp   cald   overruled in part by peterson v superior court supra  calth at p  price v shell oil co   cald   without so much as a hint of the disapproval defendant insists is warranted we have no difficulty at all finding plaintiffs suffered physical injury to their property  in so concluding we reject defendants strained argument that for purposes of product liability law a home is the equivalent of for instance a toaster which when it catches fire due to faulty wiring can be said to have injured only itself  the analogy just doesnt fit  when a defective foundation results in cracked walls ceilings and counter tops throughout the home recovery of strict liability damages is not barred by the economic loss rule  plaintiffs crossappeal  plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in denying them recovery of the costs and fees they incurred in employing geotechnical and structural experts to obtain and analyze soils samples and perform the necessary design calculations to enable plaintiffs to determine an appropriate repair methodology to correct the defect  they argue these investigative costs were completely distinct from the litigation costs due these experts and were properly recoverable as part of the cost of repair  because the crossappeal presents a pure question of law we conduct a de novo review  stratton v first nat life ins co   calappd     during the trial glenn tofani plaintiffs soils expert distinguishing between litigation and investigative costs testified his firm billed plaintiffs  for the investigative work performed by it and its subcontractors  florian barth a concrete and structural expert for plaintiffs testified to between  and  in investigative billings and like tofani separated that amount from costs relating to the litigation  defendant did not crossexamine the experts or otherwise try to contradict the evidence   plaintiffs initially proposed a modified baji no  instruction for including investigative costs as part of the cost of repair  however the parties subsequently agreed to let the court decide whether these costs were recoverable  after the jury rendered its verdict plaintiffs filed a memorandum of costs seeking to recover the investigative fees as costs to the prevailing party  however on the courts instruction they later filed a motion to recover the fees as cost of repairs damages  plaintiffs challenge the trial courts denial of that motion  expert fees as costs  expenses relating to expert witness fees can arise in two contexts  under code of civil procedure section  subdivision a the prevailing party may recover as costs fees of expert witnesses ordered by the court  all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise stated  the court here did not order plaintiffs experts to testify thus expert fees were not recoverable by plaintiffs as costs unless expressly authorized by law elsewhere  §  subd b  inter alia section  gives the court discretion to order a defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of plaintiffs expert witnesses if the defendant rejects plaintiffs statutory offer to compromise and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment at trial  §  subd d  plaintiffs perforce contend the fees and costs they seek are not expert fees under sections  and   the argument is necessary because prior to trial plaintiffs served a section  offer to compromise their claims against defendant in exchange for   defendant rejected the offer and the jury awarded plaintiffs  less than the statutory offer  thus under section  defendant obtained a more favorable judgment than the statutory offer depriving the trial court of discretion to order defendant to pay plaintiffs expert fees expert fees as damages  having eliminated any potential consideration of the expert witness fees as costs plaintiffs contend they are entitled to recover the fees as damages  citing ravens cove townhomes inc v knuppe development co supra  calappd  they argue and for purposes of the crossappeal defendant concedes the cost of repair is the proper measure of damages in a construction defect case  id at p   civil code section  provides for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract the measure of damages except where otherwise expressly provided by this code is the amount which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby whether it could have been anticipated or not  as the ravens cove court concluded since tort damages are intended to make the injured plaintiff whole the proper measure of damages in a construction defect case is the cost of remedying the defects together with the value of the lost use if any during the period of injury  ravens cove townhomes inc v knuppe development co supra  calappd at p   regan roofing co v superior court   calappth  is informative  there the issue arose in the context of a good faith settlement motion involving the nonsettling defendants objection to allocation of  for expert investigation fees  id at p   the court correctly reasoned it would be proper to view this  expert expense as damages due for a portion of the cost of repair which is an appropriate measure of damages in cases based on damage to real property  citations  id at p   defendant asks us to disregard regan roofing because it involved a settlement not a trial  we find no meaningful distinction  the record is clear the court denied plaintiffs motion not because it doubted the credibility of the expert witnesses but because it believed the law did not allow it to require defendant to pay the expert fees even if they were incurred solely in relation to the costs of repair  the court was wrong  plaintiffs were entitled to be made whole   defendant protests that all litigation expenses are at least arguably caused by the wrong out of which the lawsuit arises and yet the legislature has determined expert expenses are recoverable if at all as costs not as damages  in support of their argument they cite ripley v pappadopoulos   calappth  which states compensation of an expert is in the first instance the responsibility of the party who hires the expert  id at p   ripley is inapt  it considers the issue of costs under sections  and  not damages under civil code section   because the uncontradicted testimony established plaintiffs were billed  by professionals who investigated the problems in order to formulate an appropriate repair plan it would serve no purpose to remand the issue for further consideration  sections  and  give an appellate court power to modify a judgment and direct the trial court to enter the proper judgment  that authority will be exercised when as here the record shows the parties rights can be determined fully on appeal  see  witkin cal procedure th ed  appeal §  p  and cases cited therein    disposition  the order denying plaintiffs motion to recover expert fees as damages is reversed  the judgment in favor of plaintiffs is modified to include an additional  representing those damages  as so modified the judgment is affirmed  plaintiffs shall recover their costs on appeal           rylaarsdam j

rate jeffrey d stearman – attorney at law huntington beach ca law firm debt collection  recovery our goal is to provide our clients with the highest standards of quality and service by utilizing cutting edge techniques to collect outstanding receivables in an expeditious and amicable manner attorney stearman is also a california licensed private investigator ca pi  which enables him to better locate skipped debtors and locate assets why should i use an attorney instead of a collection agency the direct intervention by the law office of jeffrey d stearman often results in greater recovery of outstanding accounts receivables and bad debt in many circumstances the fear of prompt and substantial legal action results in recovery of outstanding obligations without suit becoming necessary debtors are less likely to ignore a collection letter from an attorney collection agencies cannot file small claims lawsuits in california only attorneys can do the one thing that debtors fear most file a lawsuit to collect the debt the shock of a process server or the sheriff on the debtor’s doorstep is a pretty good indication that you are serious about collecting your money many creditors just threaten suit many debtors know that most creditors will not sue so they just ignore them having the sheriff show up takes your unpaid account to a new level of importance to the debtor in california corporate debtors must be represented by a lawyer the debtor now has to either hire a lawyer of their own or just lose by default either way they are much more inclined to try to work it out if not they know they are facing a collection attorney in addition after judgment the debtor is also facing wage garnishments bank levies etc what should i look for in a collection attorney when selecting a law firm to collect a past due account the attorney should know how to evaluate your case to maximize recovery your lawyer should know how to take the case to trial if necessary and should have the resources find assets and collect unpaid judgments at the law office of jeffrey d stearman we do not utilize paralegals to do the work each case is personally handled by attorney stearman further once judgment is obtained we do not need to hire outside private investigators to help identify assets to enforce money judgments as attorney stearman has the advantage of also being a california licensed private investigator we offer both hourly and contingent fee agreements call  or email our office for a free consultation about your collection matter practice areas collections

helpful and patient with me i highly recommend jeff stearman thanks again jeff june    when i shopped jeffrey d stearman i found that every attorney i spoke with was bouncing all over the place for my business not paying attention to the information i was providing and showing no direct honesty as mr stearman did when we spoke he left me a feeling of confidence and took all of the pressure off of me that an out of state case could cause i highly recommend his services and would not hesitate to use him again may    my experience with mr stearman has been excellent i recommend him highly to

acted on this recommendation  without going into details of somewhat unique and complicated divorce case mr stearman not only proved his level of expertise but also offered emotional and practical support which can be an invaluable benefit in such situations  i felt that he was there to guide and counsel he truly took the time to help me reach decisions that will best address my concerns while helping me not get caught up in the emotional aspect of this process i highly recommend attorney stearman december    jeffrey stearman did a great job for me  always responded quickly with any questions i had for him jeffrey took care of my needs through this process  would highly recommend jeffrey services november    mr stearman was a fantastic lawyer i never had to give any thought or concerns about my divorce which meant i was able to get on with my life what a relief it was to have him take care of everything for me august    attorney stearman recently helped me with my case i greatly appreciated his nononsense approach to a process that has a tendency to be emotionally charged he presents things clearly and educates you on decisions to be made he was great efficient and gracious when things needed to be done i have already recommended mr stearman to people that i talk with june    outstanding service and results attorney jeffrey stearman was referred to me by another lawyer which turnedout to be a terrific decision jeffrey represented me extremely well he is timely professional articulate and very well organized he followsup on a regular basis values mutual respect and spoke to me as a concerned individual in short he cares and it made the difference between my ability to survive financially and emotionally etc – or declare bankruptcy i happily survived the case and my children and i are doing very well i highly regard mr stearman and happily refer jeffrey stearman april    i met jeffrey twice and on the second time was able to obtain him as my

ex thank you very much jeffrey  you took my calls tried to keep my costs down and got me through a terrible time in my life thank you so much february    mr stearman once again i want to convey my

lawyers pertaining to a variety of matters  mr  stearman however handled my case with professionalism confidence and kept me completely informed on what he was doing as well as what the other party was doing also i felt i got the representation that i paid for other firms seemed to nickel and dime me to death i felt my case was a rather uncommon case to handle family law but jeffrey was very confident about the situation and the outcome which in return gave me the confidence to even proceed with the case  i was very satisfied with the outcome as a result of jeffrey’s work efforts on my behalf march    mr stearman is a very competent and professional attorney going through a divorce is such a very hard thing my only concern was custody of my children and mr stearman understood that
