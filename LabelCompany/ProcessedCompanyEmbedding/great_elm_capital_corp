massive nols could lead to huge upsidegreat elm capital group nysegec is a publicly traded holding company whose strategy is to invest its capital in investment management financial products and merchant banking businesses the companys balance sheet carries  billion of federal nols all of which were generated from businesses that have been divested great elm capital group great elm closed on the sale of its patent business on june   for upfront gross proceeds of  million with the potential for an additional  million to be received on june   following the redemption of all legacy debt anticipated by october   the company will be debtfree and own through its  million investment in great elm capital corporation nasdaqgecc a piece of a newly created business development company that will hold primarily debt instruments of middlemarket companies great elm will also own  of great elm capital management gecm which will manage gecc from which it will earn investment management and incentive fees great elm capital group great elm nasdaqgec  million investment in great elm capital corp  ownership of great elm capital management  million contingent payment on june  from the sale of a patent portfolio  billion federal nols great elm capital corp   million value gecc is a newly formed externally managed nondiversified closedend management company that will be regulated as a bdc gecc will seek to generate current income and capital appreciation through the ownership of debt securities of middlemarket companies on june   gecc entered into a merger agreement with full circle capital corp full whereby full will merge an approximately  million portfolio into gecc gecc will also receive a  million cash investment from great elm and prior to the closing of the full transaction gecc will acquire a portfolio from mast funds valued at approximately  million the resulting portfolio with a nav of about  million will be managed by gecm even though i expect the value of great elms investment in gecc to appreciate by around  over the coming year i am conservatively valuing its stake in gecc at cost or  million great elm capital management   million value great elm will own  of gecm which will be the investment advisor to gecc gecm will earn a  management fee plus a  incentive fee above a  annualized hurdle i estimate gecc will earn a management fee of  million  x  million gross assets and that the fund earns a  return before fees which would generate an incentive fee of roughly  million for total revenues of  million i estimate an initial net profit margin of  of revenues which could rise over time if the fund grows through acquisitions and benefits from scale under this scenario first year after tax net income will amount to  million considerable upside exists to revenue and profits due to potential outperformance of certain gecc holdings contingent proceeds from sale of patent business due june    million value on june   great elm formerly unwired planet closed on the sale of its patent business to panoptis for  million in cash and a  million contingent payment due june   i believe it is highly probable that great elm will receive the  million payment on june   but estimate its riskadjusted net present value to be  million to be conservative  billion in federal net operating losses   to  million value great elm retains  billion in nols due to losses dating back to the s from software businesses that have been divested with a top federal tax rate of  the undiscounted value of the nols amounts to  million normally a company such as great elm would use its nols to offset income from businesses acquired but the magnitude of great elms nols would require a large amount of debt and equity for size sufficient acquisitions so much equity in fact that nol monetization would need to take place over many many years to avoid the limitation due to irs ownership change of control rules that equity issuance would trigger i believe highly structured transactions could monetize a large portion if not all of the nols over the next  months by creating bespoke financial products that require little to no capital investment from great elm the sharing of the nol tax shield between gec and third parties could produce anywhere from roughly  million to  million in proceeds to gec in my estimation indeed the creation of its bdc great elm capital corp may be the first step toward unlocking the value of its nols announced rights offering on september   the company announced a  million capital raise through a backstopped rights offering which will allow the company to retire highpriced paymentinkind pik debt the rights offerings record date should occur within the next  days it is notable that funds managed by mast capital which owns over  of the companys shares and all gec board members will participate in the rights offering i view the participation by these parties as positive especially the participation of board member jess ravitch whom has deep experience in unlocking the value of nols ravitchs alj regional holdings otcpkaljj is up over x since  shareholders of record on the record date will experience very little dilution in this undervalued company should they exercise their rights which i recommend summary i estimate gec to be worth before the capital raise  per share at a minimum i arrive at this downside valuation by adding the sum of the following parts investment in gecc  cost  million gecm  million x  multiple  million risk adjusted pv of june  patent sale payment  million sotp excluding nol  million shares outstanding  million downside value per share  the table below establishes upside scenarios based on nol monetization each column represents a different percentage share of the nol shield to be retained by great elm discounted back one year by   share  share  share nol npv  million  million  million sotp exnol  million  million  million total upside value  million  million
