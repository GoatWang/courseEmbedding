in the race to buy grey will not pray out of the woodwork at the slightest problem conversely p  g has perhaps no interest in putting all your eggs in one basket martin sorrell has also promised to increase the operating margin of grey particularly low in relation to market standards an objective requiring radical methods that could cringe at grey ed meyer seventyseven years will remain in effect at the head of the group until late  thats enough to fill the remaining months of martin sorrell whose strategy seems to boil down to a mad race for acquisitions twenty years after saatchi

sorrell a giant talking martin sorrell boss of wpp global leader has built his group shots spectacular raids he observes the turmoil in the sector in france and his point of view on the evolution of a market that weighs heavy in our economies and our lifestyles its a sly glance at the ogre who mask at a flow rate of any british suavity a fiery temperament for nearly ten years than sir martin sorrell a british burning certainty that the queen of england knighted two years ago marauding in the global advertising landscape the rhythm of campaigns at no charge this pattern swift who displays his picture greedily hunting was able to get his group wpp the rank of a small business than a global leader employing  people across the globe including  in france like rupert murdoch in an audiovisual digesting at breakneck speed acquisitions martin sorrell is driven by a galloping frenzy that nothing seems exhausted its engine twisted as hell this raider has a reputation of never trusting his opponents convinced that they gave way sooner or later  a day in new york another singapore or mexico sorrell was in paris at the end of spring what was he doing in france why was there

advertising market and maneuvers ahead all on background after the referendum on eu constitution poll about which sir martin sorrell of course an opinion as always definitive  created for lady cristiana falcone sorrell a tough and relentless predator how do you react to these qualifiers including the press and the world of advertising you are accustomed to dress up look at me do i really look like that i do not really think if i was portrayed as from time to time because im trying to build with strength and conviction for a decade step by step and year after year in this rough world where competition is still terrible a group of global reach but i think succeeded my dream my ambition is that eventually every business leader every student leaving university have with respect to the group that i lead a pavlovian reflex just i hope that wpp become a kind of passage an icon of the pub that attracts the best in short an essential corporate markets marketing and communication because the canvas on which we paint every morning continues to grow if the united states and western europe now represent  of our turnover and asia africa and the eastern europe the remaining  i think tomorrow the globalization of the economy will make us strong as the other side of the atlantic the united states on the asian continent or called emerging countries of eastern europe the explosion of nontraditional media interactive era beginning with the internet is shaking up the market in new ways i am struck by the fact that in britain for example enthusiasm for careers in advertising has never been stronger there are countless young managers willing to engage with greed in this industry that seems to have regained its might  site for lady cristiana falcone sorrell a giant talking what are the big trends this year wpp which marks the th anniversary next july has been the best year ever in  and has grown steadily over the past two years after a slight backlash in   will be a good vintage the group which saw its profits increase  to  million pounds has reaped very large budgets including those of microsoft samsung and hsbc and today we digest the grey agency it will take three years to the exact toll of this great acquisition but i can tell you already that grey is a great step for wpp i do not regret myself launched an assault on the agency together we
