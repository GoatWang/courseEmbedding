winstonsalem nc wednesday march  photo ap photochuck burton  connecttweetlinkedincommentemailmorechicago — one of the first indicators of who nba teams are considering for the draft can be inferred at the annual combinethe indiana pacers have several needs heading into the june  draft their roster needs to get younger they need consistent shooters they need mobile versatile players in a league where the demand has never been higherkevin pritchard the pacers’ new team president understands this pritchard along with new adviser larry bird coach nate mcmillan and director of scouting ryan carr spent most of wednesday and thursday morning interviewing nine prospects two of the most intriguing players interviewed were wake forest’s john collins and ucla’s tj leafboth fit the modern requirements for a power forward collins is  with a  wingspan and  pounds leaf also is  with a  wingspan and weighs  pounds both prospects are known for their fluid play athleticism and ability to make a jumperand similar to many players ready to join the nba collins and leaf were eager thursday to share details about their meetings with the pacers“it was their willingness to work with me and willingness to welcome people into their organization” collins said on what impressed him about the pacers “they let players know that they are a legendary organization and that big things come from indiana they have paul george and myles turner so they have two really solid building blocks to go off of i think that’s really good and they were in the playoffs”leaf added “kevin pritchard is a great guy i look forward to just getting to know them a little bit more i think most likely i’ll probably head out there for a workout”ucla bruins forward tj leaf  dunks the ball against the cincinnati bearcats during the second round of the  ncaa tournament at golden  center photo kelley l cox usa today sportsin the first round the pacers possesses the th overall pick several mock draft boards — including draftexpresscom hoopshypecom and cbssportscom — have collins and leaf being selected in the middle of the first round jeff goodman a draft analyst for espn said in a conference call tuesday that leaf could be available for indiana“i would say they’re important” pritchard said of interviewing prospects “they’re not the most important but i like getting a feel for what a player is like what are they off the court what’s important to them are they obsessed about being a good basketball player do they have good balance do they kind of just play basketball for the heck of it i want to know that because it really helps you understand whether there’s fit because the nba has gotten a lot better the last  years of evaluating talent with analytics so now it really comes down to does the personality fit”the power forward position was a tenuous one for the pacers last season mcmillan never had a suitable backup behind veteran thaddeus young the issue became glaring when young sustained a sprained left wrist injury that nagged him — and sapped his ability to shoot from the perimeter — in the second half the season the pacers lost six consecutive games soon after young’s injury and opponents continued to expose the team’s lack of mobility at the position the pacers have the option on the final year of lavoy allen’s contract and kevin seraphin excelled more last season as the backup centerinsider pritchard bird continue to work together through draft free agencythe pacers according to a league source wanted to interview collins and leaf because they were impressed with how both players showed a consistent work ethic that helped their improvement throughout their college careers collins  returned to school for his sophomore year and led the demon deacons to the ncaa tournament last season averaging  points and  rebounds per game in learning from coach danny manning a former nba player collins said he became more proficient by developing better positioning in the post improving his conditioning and learning how to better use his body as a screenandroll player“i went from not playing that much to a significant starter” collins said of his transformation “to see myself grow into handling that leadership role was great in that extra year coach put a lot of trust and faith in me i had to put in a lot of work and i did my best to prepare myself for that role last year”leaf  helped lead the bruins to the sweet  averaging  points and  rebounds per game as a freshmanthe pacers according to the source identified collins and leaf as intelligent players who are capable of grasping every aspect of a team’s playbook and defensive principles last year pritchard referenced georges niang’s high basketball iq when the pacers selected him the second round pritchard wants to continue to add betterthanaverage thinkers to the pacers’ rosterleaf said he benefited intellectually last season from playing alongside lonzo ball who many consider a topthree pick“i feel my iq is very high” leaf said “playing with lonzo me and him both had very high iqs and i think it helped i think we grew off of each other and learned things from each other that we really didn’t know about the game of basketball”exucla teammate tj leaf close with lonzo ball but not buying his shoescollins and leaf each identified the same skill they want show teams throughout the predraft period consistent perimeter shooting both players are aware they will better their chances of convincing a team to select them in the first round if they enhance their shooting mechanics“i think i can score on three levels which a lot of bigs are not able to do” leaf said who shot  percent last seasoncollins attempted just one pointer last season but he produced impressive shooting statistics in thursday’s individual workouts collins shot  percent from the right and left corner on spotup shooting he shot  percent from the top of the key“i think i can shoot it a lot better than i’ve shown” collins said “i’m definitely going to keep working on that and expanding my range so that when the time is necessary for me to shoot it i’m looking good doing it”first team workout mondaythe pacers
