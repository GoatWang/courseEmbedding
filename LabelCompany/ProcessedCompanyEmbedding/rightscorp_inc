fair debt collection practices act california’s rosenthal act and abuse of process for the willful misuse of subpoena power by issuing special dmca subpoenas under  usc § h mr pietzs original plaintiff withdrew from the case after locating replacement plaintiffs he refiled the suit but dropped half of the claims originally contained in it subsequently one of mr pietzs two surviving claims was stricken by the court and in the process legal fees were awarded against mr pietzs client at approximately the same time over mr pietzs objections the court dismissed mr harmon whom mr pietz had incorrectly identified as an employee or officer of rightscorp from the case on may   a federal court ordered john blaha represented by pietz to pay attorney’s fees in john blaha v rightscorp pietz filed the lawsuit as a class action he asserted rightscorp on behalf of warner bros and bmg rights management abused the judicial system by issuing  dmca subpoenas rightscorp countered that suing on

subpoenas do not require internet service providers isps to identify their users to the issuer of the subpoena indeed an isp that does provide that information can face sanctions as can the issuer of the subpoena the notice sent by rightscorp prevents a lawsuit for the specific download in the notice however because of the language in the notice paying the settlement is an admission of guilt although rightscorp is then unable to sue for that infringement not only can they sue and press charges for subsequent downloads but they have the original settlement as admission of guilt of previous infringement comcast the largest internet provider in the united states has continually refused to forward rightscorps dmca settlement notices in the form in which rightscorp sends them comcast removes the threatening language and the settlement offer and instead simply forwards a letter to their customer that basically reads as an incident report referencesedit  a b kevin collier  jul  meet

collapse all history of copyrights the  statute of anne established the principles of authors ownership of copyright and a fourteen year term of protection the law prevented a monopoly on the part of the booksellers and created a public domain for literature after the expiration of the copyright and ensured that once a work was purchased the copyright owner no longer had complete control over its use for the first time the law provided for an authors copyright then in  the framers of the united states constitution wrote in article i section  the congress shall have power    to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries a major revision of the us copyright act was completed in  among other things to address the needs of the brand new recording industry the bill broadened the scope of categories protected to include all works of authorship and extended the term of protection to twentyeight years with a possible renewal of twentyeight the main object to be desired in expanding copyright protection accorded to music has been to give the composer an adequate return for the value of his composition and it has been a serious and difficult task to combine the protection of the composer with the protection of the public and to so frame an act that it would accomplish the double purpose of securing to the composer an adequate return for all use made of his composition and at the same time prevent the formation of oppressive monopolies which might be founded upon the very rights granted to the composer for the purpose of protecting his interests hr rep no  th cong nd sess p   the history of digital piracy the personal computer debuted on the cover of popular electronics in january  and a year later bill gates of microsoft was battling piracy as he was trying to get his fledgling company microsoft off the ground in his letter to software pirates of that era he wrote who cares if the people who worked on it get paid the arrival of pp shawn  fanning while a student at northeastern university in boston changed  the  music and media industry with his creation of a digital  file‐sharing program called  napster in  he created a software program that allowed computer users to  share and  exchange files  napster had several hundred thousand users by the  spring of  and had grown to over  million users by february   this technology is called peertopeer or pp because it allows peers ordinary computers to exchange files between themselves by  pp traffic had become  of all consumer internet traffic globally and according to “pp traffic to grow almost  over the next  years as legitimate pp applications become a meaningful segment” from multimedia intelligence pp traffic would grow by  by  by  according to “verizon gets ahead of the broadband crunch” in the wall street journal file sharing accounted for approximately  of all global internet traffic more than twice as much as web browsing and is forecast to nearly double from  to  to almost  petabytes a month the chart above was generated from data by cisco in its “global ip traffic forecast and methodology ” and featured at wwwsatmagazinecom the digital millennium copyright act in the united states the law is strongly in favor of protecting the interests of copyright holders the digital millennium copyright act dmca passed in  heightened the penalties for copyright infringement on the internet and established the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users the dmca made illegal the manufacture sale or distribution of codecracking devices used to illegally copy software eg limewire edonkey and bittorrent additionally the dmca states that service providers may not allow the illegal downloading of copyrighted materials via their systems the united states code  usc  states as follows remedies for infringement damages and profits  in a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving and the court finds that infringement was committed willfully the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than  the music industry has spent millions of dollars searching for a technology breakthrough to protect copyrighted works these technologies were often referred to as digital rights management drm drm technologies attempt to prevent digital music player technology from allowing reproduction these efforts failed to stem the tide of illegal downloading beginning in  the recording industry association of america riaa the trade group that represents the us music industry filed the first lawsuits against individuals who were suspected of illegally downloading music in  free peers inc closed its business due to a  million settlement with the recording industry  under the dmca the industry has won lawsuits against napster grokster bearshare limewire and many others  by october  riaa had filed  lawsuits against individual downloaders even with  lawsuits filed and millions of dollars collected pp traffic had still grown worldwide to represent more than  of all consumer internet traffic isps have liability if they do not act if isps are required to make a reasonable effort to curtail illegal activity on their networks isps are given “safe harbor” protection as long as once the isp is notified of a copyright infringement they forward the notice to their customer additionally the dmca requires isps to suspend the service of repeat infringers how pp is misused a february  study done by sauhard sahi at princeton university found that only  of files transferred on bittorrent did not infringe on copyrighted material pp is profitable for pirates in  it was revealed that just one bittorrent hostingtracker site was making  million a year on advertising additionally these sites are making money scraping user’s data from their hard drives and selling it for marketing and even identity theft purposes in february  the federal trade commission sent letters to almost  organizations notifying them that personal information including sensitive data about customers and employees had been shared from their computer networks and was available on peer topeer pp filesharing networks to any users of those networks who could use it to commit identity theft or fraud how file sharing works first a user downloads frostwire software or any number of other free gnutella peertopeer pp applications installs the application on their computer and searches for a song movie or game the gnutella application then sends a request to the gnutella network a voluntary network of all users of gnutella applications the application uses the network to create a list of all of the available versions of the requested content which is then displayed the user selects the version and source of the content that they want to download the gnutella application then sends a request for the content out to the network usually the previous users who have downloaded the content have the content available on their computer for the next person who wants it  after downloading they would specifically have to disable the application from offering it back to the network the gnutella clients literally “talk amongst themselves” without any involvement from the user and the full piece of content gets sent to the requested user in many small pieces from many individual users computers very quickly the user has the desired content in moments  an entire discography can take as little as five minute to download on ordinary connections for free by contrast the bittorrent pp network works in a different way  first the user locates a “torrent” file that contains the detailed location of the computers that have the source files think of almost any popular old or new recording artists or movie and enter the name into google google will often display a drop down list that will contain the word “discography” within the first page of search results you will see the links to the torrent site for the artist or movie these torrent pages also create revenue from serving advertisements public torrent hosting sites such as the pirate bay allow users to search and download from their collection of torrent files users can typically also upload torrent files for content they wish to distribute often these sites also run bittorrent trackers for their hosted torrent files but these two functions are not mutually dependent a torrent file could be hosted on one site and tracked by another unrelated site the industry has developed its own terminology seeders are people who have finished downloading  of a file and are sharing it for download leachers are people who are downloading the file and sharing a small part of it at the same time in order to obtain and maintain rapid downloads a user usually must allow their computer to upload desired content back to the network bittorrent private hosttracker sites such as demonoid operate like public ones except that they restrict access to registered users and keep track of the amount of data each user uploads and downloads in an attempt to reduce leeching bittorrent search engines allow the discovery of torrent files that are hosted and tracked on other sites examples include mininova btjunkie torrentz the pirate bay eztorrent and isohunt these sites allow the user to ask for content meeting specific criteria such as containing a given word or phrase and retrieve a list of links to torrent files matching those criteria   call us  supportrightscorpcom pay a notice if you have received an email notice from your isp with a subject that starts with unauthorized use of copyrights owned exclusively by dartmouth college addresses copyright issues an excellent approach to the issue outlined very clearly rightscorp  why did i receive a notice  rightscorp inc july   otcqb riht investors blog home received a notice click here menu  corporate  opportunity  projects  investors  news  contact why did i receive a notice it is a violation of united states federal law  usc  to share our clients media on peertopeer filesharing programs like bittorrent utorrent vuze and frostwire or similar applications  these programs copy and distribute the files that they share  a copyright means that the copyright owner has the sole right to determine who may copy and distribute the copyrighted works if you receieved a notice then a computer located at the internet address that the notice is addressed to has uploaded downloaded or offered to distribute the copyrighted content detailed in the notice which clearly identifies the name and type of material the time the offence occurrred the ip address and port of the originating location the computer at issue is not authorized to distribute this content  accordingly any distribution is a violation of law  the content is owned by our customer and the customer has authorized us to monitor illegal sharingdistribution of this content it is the subscriber’s responsibility to assure that his or her connection is being used lawfully specifically to make sure that any wireless routers have passwords to prevent unauthorized access and that houseguests and family members are using the connection lawfully overview rightscorps software monitors the global peer‐to‐ peer pp file sharing networks to seek out and find illegally downloaded digital media on behalf of digital media copyright owners and through major internet service providers “isps” we automatically send out copyright infringement and demand notices to those who have illegally downloaded digital media infringers remit payment to rightscorp inc for the copyright infringement and rightscorp makes payment to the copyright owners many infringers who do not pay are disconnected by their isps the problem is huge there were  billion illegal downloads of music in  and  billion illegal downloads of movies in  alone rightscorps technology system monitors the global peer‐to‐peer pp file sharing networks and sends emails to isps using the notice format specified in the digital millennium copyright act with the date time song title and other specific technology identifiers to confirm the infringement by the isp’s customer under federal copyright law once the isp has actual knowledge of copyright infringements that take place using its network it has specific duties in relation to the enforcement of the rights of the owners of the material in question every isp is required by law to enforce a policy that provides in appropriate circumstances for termination of internet service to subscribers who become repeat infringers  your isp’s terms of use or similar user agreement probably specifically state that it can terminate your service if you violate the copyrights of others  one way that an isp can satisfy its own legal obligations is to facilitate its subscribers’ compliance with copyright law – including by terminating subscribers who repeatedly violate copyright laws  when the isp notifies its subscriber of an infringement by passing along rightscorps notice or otherwise the customer remits payment to rightscorp who passes on a percentage to the copyright owner digital copyrights  piracy background click tab to openclose  expand all  collapse all is filesharing illegal us copyright law including the changes embodied in the digital millennium copyright act the “dmca” calls for substantial penalties for copyright infringement on the internet  under established statutory and case law third parties that assist or are other wise involved in copyright infringement can have vast legal exposure as well  in the pp context an individual subscriber may be the “direct “ infringer of a copyright but that subscriber’s activities are conducted over the isp’s facilities  accordingly isps that become aware of illegal filesharing over their networks but that fail to take steps to mitigate it are at risk of liabilities large enough to put them out of business  that is why isps are serious about illegal pp activity  they have to be the united states code  usc  states as follows remedies for infringement damages and profits  in a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving and the court finds that infringement was committed wilfully the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than  obviously isps want to avoid this type of liability  the dmca gives isps a road map often referred to as the “safe harbors” that tells them what they must do to avoid being liable themselves for copyright infringement that is carried on by their subscribers  isps can take advantage of “safe harbour” benefits by helping rightscorp contact individual subscribers and settle infringement issues with them  the pp landscape the most popular access tools are limewire bittorrent and emule and the most popular corresponding protocols being gnutella bittorrent and edonkey there are operating companies like lime group llc that sell and market the limewire access software and bittorrent inc that market and sell the bittorrent software limewire was sued by the music industry and by universal music group specifically a user downloads limewire software or any number of other free gnutella clients installs it on their computer and searches for a song the gnutella client sends a query to the gnutella network and a list of all of the available versions of the song comes up the user selects the version that they want the gnutella client sends a request for the song out to the network the previous users who have downloaded the song have the song available on their computer for the next person who wants it the gnutella clients literally “talk amongst themselves” without any involvement from the user and the full song gets sent to the requested user in thousands of small pieces from thousands of individual computers this is what makes it so fast the bittorrent network works slightly differently it requires that the user first locate a “torrent” file that contains the detail on the location of the computers that have the source files the industry has developed its own terminology seeders are people who have finished downloading  of a file and are sharing it for download leachers are people who are downloading the file and sharing a small part of it at the same time it is very important to grasp that in order to obtain rapid downloads a user must allow their computer to upload to the network if it is illegal why does it continue under fcc regulations isps are not allowed to block specific types of network traffic the idea being that if they are allowed to block peertopeer traffic they could also block any type of content religious or political a violation of freedom of speech isp’s do have the obligation to assist copyright holders in their enforcement of their rights but the isps cannot fullfill that obligation by simply blocking access to pp traffic  how it works our technology system monitors the global peertopeer pp file sharing networks and sends emails to internet service providers “isps” as per the digital millennium copyright act with the date time song title and other specific technology identifiers to confirm the infringement by the isp’s customer   once the isp is in possession of these facts they forward the notice or send a distinct notice to their customer and to disconnect the services of repeat offenders when appropriate rightscorp inc collects payments and makes remits to the copyright owner a percentage of these settlements  every mp file that is downloaded has at least two copyrights a sound recording copyright and a publishing copyright the publishing copyright is the right to use the song separate from the sound recording such as putting the song in a movie rerecording the song or printing the lyrics and melody on sheet music according to us law copyright owners have the right to be paid when their copyrighted materials are used we have an agreement with the recording artist music label or music publisher who owns the copyright cited in the notice you received our technology monitors the internet all of the time looking for infringements when a copyright is infringed upon we receive the following data date and time of infringement filename isp name ip address port similar to the last four digits on your ninedigit zip code we send this data to the isp in an automated computer format called xml these emails are called “dmca notices” and they follow the format prescribed in subsection  c of the dmca  though the format is the same for other legal reasons these notices should not be confused with “takedown” notices the isp keeps “router logs” of all of the activity on their networks when we send these notices they crossreference the data we send with their router logs by doing this cross reference the isp knows which one of their customers was using the ip address in question at the time and date specified due to the dmca law as described above they forward these notices to their customer on the customer’s email address the notice comes to the customer from their isp not from rightscorp inc the user who receives the notice is liable for  in damages but if they click on the link supplied by rightscorp they can enter a credit card and we will settle the matter between them and the copyright owner

free speech by timothy geignerwed jun th  pm filed under copyright disconnection dmca first amendment free speech internet access packingham rights scotus companies bmg cox rightscorp permalinkshort link as predicted coxs latest appeal points to scotus refusal to disconnect sex offenders from social mediafrom the whichisworse dept last week the supreme court managed to hold its nose long enough to properly assert that banning convicted sex offenders from social media was plainly an infringement on their first amendment rights while much of the media coverage focused on the question of sex offenders having access to these welltrafficked websites the real implications of the ruling were always likely to be far more reaching we specifically pointed to the reasonable question if sex offenders cant be blocked from internet sites due to their first amendment rights how can we possibly require isps to disconnect those accused of piracy from the internet under even the most tortured reading of i of the dmca in that original post mike wrote i expect that to be quoted in many other cases  and a big one may be the ongoing attempts right now by the legacy entertainment industry to force isps to kick people off of their service based on accusations not convictions of infringement those cases like this packingham case involve using a law to claim that people should be blocked from using the internet and based on the quotes above it seems quite likely that parts of the dmca are clearly unconstitutional the lawsuits  mainly the bmg v cox ruling which is currently on appeal and the more recent umg v grande communications which follows the same basic outlines of the cox case  involve arguing that i of the dmca requires isps to kick users off their service entirely based on accusations of infringement as weve explained this already appears to be a twisted interpretation of i but now it appears theres a very reasonable chance that the supreme court could find i outright unconstitutional under the first amendment for broadly blocking internet access in a way that harms free speech rights it appears were starting down the road of finding out exactly what the courts answer to this question will be as cox recently filed an appeal and has now referenced the scotus decision in its written arguments packingham is directly relevant to what constitute ‘appropriate circumstances’ to terminate internet access to cox’s customers the decision emphatically establishes the centrality of internet access to protected first amendment activity as the court recognized internet sources are often ‘the principal sources for knowing current events checking ads for employment speaking and listening in the modern public square and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge’ the filing goes on to note that the government is not allowed to infringe on free speech in order to prohibit unlawful speech if ever there were an example of that very thing it certainly would be accused pirates being disconnected from what has now been cited as a speech medium in the internet im genuinely looking forward to hearing oral arguments from the legal staff of the movie and record labels that those accused of piracy typically on flimsy at best evidence ought to be afforded less rights than convicted sex offenders weve seen much demonizing of the internet in general and piracy in particular but im having a hard time conjuring up the images of those lawyers managing to go that far thats an argument thats going to need to be made however given the contention of coxs latest filing and if it offends the constitution to cut off a portion of internet access to convicted criminals then the district court’s erroneous interpretation of section i of the dmca — which effectively invokes the state’s coercive power to require isps to terminate all internet access to merely accused infringers — cannot stand a win for cox would mean much for the free speech rights of everyone in regards to internet access a loss would mean this countrys court system has some seriously skewed priorities for who should and should not be allowed access

cox grande communications rightscorp permalinkshort link how the supreme courts recent free speech ruling may destroy hollywoods plans to kick people off the internetfrom the aboutthat dept earlier this week we wrote about the details of the supreme courts ruling in packingham v north carolina  the case that said a north carolina law that barred convicted sex offenders from using social media was unconstitutional there were some good lines in the ruling but this may be the most important even with these assumptions about the scope of the law and the state’s interest the statute here enacts a prohibition unprecedented in the scope of first amendment speech it burdens social media allows users to gain access to information and communicate with one another about it on any subject that might come to mind by prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites north carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events checking ads for employment speaking and listening in the modern public square and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge these websites can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard they allow a person with aninternet connection to “become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox in sum to foreclose access to social media altogether is to prevent the user from engaging in the legitimate exercise of first amendment rights it is unsettling to suggest that only a limited set of websites can be used even by persons who have completed their sentences even convicted criminals—and in some instances especially convicted criminals—might receive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas in particular if they seek to reform and to pursue lawful and rewarding lives as we noted in our original post i expect that to be quoted in many other cases  and a big one may be the ongoing attempts right now by the legacy entertainment industry to force isps to kick people off of their service based on accusations not convictions of infringement those cases like this packingham case involve using a law to claim that people should be blocked from using the internet and based on the quotes above it seems quite likely that parts of the dmca are clearly unconstitutional the lawsuits  mainly the bmg v cox ruling which is currently on appeal and the more recent umg v grande communications which follows the same basic outlines of the cox case  involve arguing that i of the dmca requires isps to kick users off their service entirely based on accusations of infringement as weve explained this already appears to be a twisted interpretation of i but now it appears theres a very reasonable chance that the supreme court could find i outright unconstitutional under the first amendment for broadly blocking internet access in a way that harms free speech rights as noted by copyright professor annemarie bridy this clearly could impact those other cases following this ruling packingham is relevant to this conversation because it stands quite clearly for the proposition that broadly defined statemandated limits on access to the internet raise serious first amendment issues packingham challenged the constitutionality of a north carolina criminal statute prohibiting registered sex offenders from accessing “commercial social networking sites” on the internet in striking down the statute on first amendment grounds the court emphasized the critical importance of the internet in general and social media platforms in particular to everyday life in the “cyber age” while the court recognized a significant governmental interest in preventing use of the internet for criminal activity it held that north carolina’s ban on social media access swept too broadly interestingly the court elected not to decide with precision how much of the internet the challenged statute put off limits it declined to say—because it didn’t think it had to—whether the statute’s prohibition reached sites like amazoncom washingtonpostcom and webmdcom in addition to “commonly understood” social networking sites like facebook linkedin and twitter the court concluded that the statute couldn’t survive first amendment scrutiny even if it were narrowly construed to cover only the social media platforms that everyone can agree are social media platforms to put it another way the statute’s prohibition was broad enough to offend the first amendment even when narrowly construed to cover only parts of the web bridy doesnt go so far as to argue that packingham means i is unconstitutional  in fact she notes that its more limited than the north carolina law that was struck down but she notes packingham’s holding should serve as a reminder to lower courts interpreting section i that termination of access to the internet implicates core first amendment values “while in the past there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places in the spatial sense for the exchange of views today the answer is clear it is cyberspace” consequently courts should consider it reasonable and within the bounds of the dmca safe harbor for broadband providers to determine that “appropriate circumstances” for terminating a user’s access to the whole internet for infringing copyright are very rare harold feld from public knowledge goes a bit further in his own analysis arguing that when it comes to internet access providers it seems clear that parts of i requiring termination should be seen as unconstitutional while also pointing out that to argue against this might mean hollywood arguing that copyright infringement is somehow worse that child molestation granted hollywood lobbyists and their wholly owned subsidiaries in congress are capable of arguing with a straight face that copyright infringement is actually worse than child molestation and therefore the government purpose is sufficiently compelling to override all first amendment concerns and some judges like the district court judge in the bmg v cox decision would probably agree read his opinion here to see if you agree but i’m doubtful that the majority of appeals court judges will agree whether or not one treats the majority opinion’s public forum analysis of social networks as “dicta” which is legalese for “stuff in an opinion i don’t like so i don’t consider binding” all  supreme court justices agreed that subscribers have a first amendment right to access information and speak online and that the government cannot prohibit a person from accessing content that has nothing to do with preventing repeat offenses — even when the repeat offense is child molestation and the evidence arguably supported that child molesters were particularly prone to repetition sorry if molesting minors doesn’t justify permanently kicking you off the internet downloading  advance copies of transformers the last knight shouldn’t either congress cannot require isps to terminate subscribers accused of downloading pirating material which is what section i amounts to anymore than it can criminalize accessing the internet after being accused of downloading pirated material nor do i expect big content to prevail by arguing that getting you thrown off your isp isn’t blocking you from accessing the internet because of all the amazing broadband options you have to replace your loss of service while america boasted thousands of dialup isps in  when the dmca was passed most folks are lucky to have a choice of two landline providers capable of providing reliable always on broadband of sufficient quality to allow me to engage in all my protected first amendment online activity there is the separate question of whether or not this ruling would also kill off i as it applies to service providers on the network eg facebook twitter techdirt etc rather than internet access providers such as comcast att etc feld thinks there is an argument that the opinion could be read to block such rulings as well whether packingham makes section i’s requirement that all social media sites and other “covered entities” have termination policies for “repeat infringers” is somewhat less clear taking the majority analysis as actual opinion rather than “undisciplined dicta” then the answer is clearly yes for major social network sites and platforms including — wait for it — youtube it’s kind of hard to argue that the largest online video platform whose videos include some of the most important raw footage of critical events and which has become a central location for debate doesn’t qualify as the kind of online public forum kennedy described nor does it make much sense to say access to facebook and twitter are protected under the first amendment while access to youtube isn’t otoh i’m not sure the same analysis applies to cloud storage or other services that don’t share the attributes of a general public forum and of course websites or services that are set up expressly to facilitate the exchange of infringing material don’t qualify for safe harbor protection anyway so the hypothetical doctor evil sing along piracy exchange is already subject to liability of course none of this should apply to the platforms making decisions themselves over removing content or users from their own platforms for which the platforms have their own first amendment protections yet i would not be at all surprised to see someone raise this issue in court and argue that packingham means that major social networks facebook especially but likely twitter and youtube as well have no right to bar users i think that would be a bad result but the language in the packingham ruling at least makes such a ruling a lot more plausible than it was last week the packingham ruling is likely to have quite a lot of impact and as predicted

make any money and has struggled with some of its more bizarre legal theories unfortunately in late  one of rightscorps partners got a big ruling against cox arguing that cox violated the dmca by not properly terminating repeat infringers as we noted at the time this was based on a tortured interpretation of the law the case is still winding its way through the appeals process but rightscorp and its partners have continued to push forward using the ruling in that bmg v cox case to pressure others at least one other isp has already been sued and now the company is out claiming that its talking with top isps to get them to incorporate rightscorps copyright trolling efforts directly into their own infringement mitigation procedures “an isp good corporate citizenship program is what we feel will drive revenue associated with our primary revenue model this program is an attempt to garner the attention and ultimately inspire a behavior shift in any isp that elects to embrace our suggestions to be dmcacompliant” the company told shareholders yesterday “in this program we ask for the isps to forward our notices referencing the infringement and the settlement offer we ask that isps take action against repeat infringers through suspensions or a redirect screen a redirect screen will guide the infringer to our payment screen while limiting all but essential internet access” in other words rightscorps demand and payment processes would get included directly into how the isp notifies a user that someone has discovered the possibility of infringing activity on the account of course issuing a press release saying that theyre now beginning to have some initial and very thorough discussions with a handful of the top isps is weird you do your press releases after you come to a deal not as youre beginning a conversation with companies who almost certainly dont want to work with you the reality here is likely that this press release is just an attempt to signal to isps to be more receptive i highly doubt it will work on most large isps who are slightly more sophisticated than to be duped by something as silly as this however the threat of the bmg case being seen as good law is still a huge problem for those isps and hopefully the case will get dumped and we can all go back to watching rightscorp fail to make any money from its plans remember in the bmg case it came out that rightscorp had a phone script that told people it accused of infringing that if they wanted to prove they were innocent they had to hand their computers over to the local police department so they could perform a search really does anyone think that a company with that sort of ethical compass should be the official partner of any isp on top of that as torrentfreak points out in its article for all the talk of how rightscorp is a friendlier copyright troll in that it only demands  to  when it finds an infringement thats misleading because like responding to spam leading to more spam paying rightscorp can lead to many more demands in the wake of several similar reports this week a reddit user reported that rightscorp asked him to pay a single  fine for pirating a song

claim dmca safe harborsfrom the thisisbad dept weve been covering the bmg v cox case since the beginning and a bad decision just got made even worse  and more dangerous if youve been following the case you know that its on appeal right now and a whole bunch of amici have weighed in but in the meantime the judge in the district court judge liam ogrady has doubled down on his opportunity to chop up and mock the dmcas safe harbors by telling cox it must pay  million to bmg in legal fees because its using the dmca safe harbors as a defense was found to be objectively unreasonable thats crazy for a variety of reasons but well get there from the very beginning this case was a joke and its unfortunate that the court didnt realize that early on the case was filed back in  and we pointed out that it was really bmg and another publisher round hill music acting as a proxy for copyright trolling operation rightscorp testing out the wacky legal theory that the dmca requires that isps kick repeat infringers entirely off the internet no one has ever interpreted the dmca in this manner yes i requires a repeat infringer policy but it had always been widely recognized that that referred to services that hosted content not network providers eg youtube is required to have a repeat infringer policy that kicks users off youtube if they keep posting infringing works but your isp shouldnt kick you off the internet for the same thing if that interpretation of the law was legit youd think that someone would have tried it in court before  especially with all the whining from the mpaa and riaa about how isps werent doing enough to stop piracy so this was a real stretch as a legal theory but somewhat amazingly  even after the legal proceedings demonstrated that the lawsuit was really about copyright trolling and exposed some heinously bad behavior by copyright troll rightscorp  the case went against cox and in favor of bmg round hill music was kicked out of the case early on ogrady made it pretty clear in the case that hes not a big fan of this internet thing and doesnt see why its a big deal if someone were to get kicked off the internet at one point in the proceedings public knowledge and eff sought to file an amicus brief admittedly many district court judges arent fans of amicus briefs theyre more usually seen at appellate courts but ogrady was so dismissive of this one that it was fairly incredible i read the brief it adds absolutely nothing helpful at all it is a combination of describing the horrors that one endures from losing the internet for any length of time frankly it sounded like my son complaining when i took his electronics away when he watched youtube videos instead of doing homework and its completely hysterical so yeah judge ogrady then said that cox wasnt protected by the dmca at all which made it easy for the jury to find in favor of bmg and award it  million from cox part of the problem was that there was some sketchy behavior by cox including some really dumb emails by staff who dont understand the law but look damning but none of it should have directly impacted the legal issues but that behavior clearly influenced ogrady and now because of that ogrady has awarded legal fees by arguing that cox relying on the very same dmca safe harbors that everyone else relies on and where cox was the only major isp that would kick off any user for infringement was somehow objectively unreasonable think about that for a second lets repeat it coxs policy was the only one at a major isp that kicked people off the network for repeat infringement and every network provider regularly relies on the dmca safe harbor to protect them from liability and yet judge liam ogradys opinion says that it was objectively unreasonable oddly ogradys opinion here is again entirely focused on the bad behavior by some cox employees and not the overall question of whether or not the safe harbor actually works the way ogrady and rightscorp and basically no one else seems to think it works rather than explaining why its objectively unreasonable for cox to rely on the dmcas safe harbors ogrady basically says that the reliance was unreasonable because of the bad behavior thats conflating two separate things sanction them for bad behavior if you must but dont let that cloud the actual legal issue the objective reasonableness of a partys position is an important factor in deciding whether to award fees in a hardfought litigation battle such as this one discovery disputes and fierce briefing are to be expected and they should not be held too harshly against either party nonetheless there are a few instances in which coxs advocacy crossed the line of objective reasonableness in particular both coxs attempts to obscure its practice of reinstating infringing customers and its subsequent assertions of a deeply flawed dmca defense evince a meritless litigation position that cox vigorously defended   although coxs dmca defense cannot be categorized as frivolous or in bad faith the court found that the record conclusively establishes that before the fall of  cox did not implement its repeat infringer policy instead cox publicly purported to comply with its policy while privately disparaging and intentionally circumventing the requirements the evidence supporting this conclusion was overwhelming and it included smoking gun email conversations the most memorable of these contained coxs own abuse manager stating f    the dmca therefore although coxs defensive arguments may have been reasonable as an abstract legal theory when viewed in light of the actual facts of the case they evince an objectively unreasonable litigation position that was nonetheless vigorously defended its clear that ogrady is hung up on the bad behavior and statements by cox employees and again what they were saying was really bad but the real question is whether or not it actually violated the dmca and cox argued quite reasonably that it did not the dmca doesnt actually require what ogrady and bmg insist it does and no other isp even goes as far as cox did bad behavior or not so because you have some clueless cox employees who were spouting off internally about how much they hate the dmca an opinion shared by many and because they implemented their repeat infringer policy in a way that ogrady felt wasnt reasonable suddenly arguing that the safe harbors still should apply because they should is objectively unreasonable thats dangerous again the earlier parts of the case are already on appeal so hopefully this will all get wiped out and this order wont matter in the long run either but if it does stand its yet another serious problem thats come out of this particular case read more   comments

lawsuits against isps for contributory infringement the riaa found out long ago that dragging people ip addresses to court generated more antagonism than revenue there are a few copyright trolls out there milking pornterrible films with speculative invoices filed in federal court against fistfuls of does but none of them have shown this reliably generates revenue much less deters piracy so far rightscorp is only chasing down music pirates that plan of attack has worked so poorly the company can barely keep its doors open naturally its decided it isnt wasting its limited funds fast enough

is filled with assertions so blatantly wrong the only way they could possibly be made with a straight face is via this exact form of communication a selfcongratulatory press release the only thing proven about its technology is that its able to uncover ip addresses this is where its form of speculative invoicing originates with letters going to isps which are then asked to forward them to the subscribers at the listed ip addresses rightscorp doesnt know who the alleged infringers are so theres not a lot technical wizardry going on here and yes rightscorp has found a unique way to monetize its antipiracy effort it all depends on how you choose to define unique and monetizaton hardly at all seems to be a fairly accurate summation of its unique monetization doesnt make much money at all actually is another tagline that could be applied to it as for the astute management at the helm i dont know rightscorp has already seen what isnt working and wants to do more of it for more forms of content thats the definition of insanity not astuteness i dont think rightscorp has much left in the tank its decision to build its business model on something that has failed for many others was never a good idea even if it routed its demand letters through isps rather than federal courtrooms once youve suckered in the easilyintimidated and the poorlyinformed youre faced with the considerably

problematic ruling concerning coxs repeat infringer policy  the dmcafrom the movingonuptotheappealscourt dept for nearly two years now weve been following an important dmcarelated case between music publisher bmg and the isp cox communications while the issues are a bit down in the weeds what it really comes down to is a question of whether or not internet access providers are required to have a repeat infringer policy that removes customers who are seen to have been engaged in too much copyright infringement most people had assumed that the dmcas requirements for a repeat infringer policy only applied to hosting providers  ie those who help people host content  as opposed to transit providers who are merely providing the connectivity in this case though that important nuance seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle mainly because of some stupid behavior on the part of cox amazingly cox is basically the only major isp out there that has a history of actually kicking people off its service for infringement most others have historically refused to do so but coxs policy is ridiculously complex and involves something around  steps and on top of that cox admitted that once its kicked people off they can just sign up for new service seeing all that the court basically decided that cox was acting in bad faith and thus jumped right over the question of whether or not the repeat infringer policy even applied to cox the judge in the case judge liam ogrady who is also handling the kim dotcom case is not exactly known for his love of the internet earlier in the case he had mocked the idea that there was any harm in kicking people off the internet responding to an attempt by public knowledge and the eff to file an amicus brief the judge mocked both organizations and the proposed brief itself it is a combination of describing the horrors that one endures from losing the internet for any length of time frankly it sounded like my son complaining when i took his electronics away when he watched youtube videos instead of doing homework and its completely hysterical up against that its no surprise that cox found itself on the losing side we explained why this ruling was so problematic and it goes way beyond the  million cox was told to pay bmg as part of the process of moving on to appeal cox asked judge ogrady to reconsider his original ruling as a matter of law and hes now rejected that plea with a fairly long and detailed opinion cox raised three specific concerns about the original ruling saying that bmg failed to show actual direct infringement that it failed to provide evidence of coxs liability and that it also failed to show evidence of willfulness ogrady is not impressed on the question of direct infringement cox pointed out all of the problems with rightscorps system which is what bmg was using in identifying infringement  and also argued that rightscorps own downloads arent evidence of infringement bmg responded that they tested rightscorps system and it seemed accurate to them ogrady says that rightscorps downloads are perfectly good evidence and doesnt go much deeper than that on the question of coxs liability is where things really go off the rails cox points to the famous and important ruling in the sony betamax case that said that vcr devices are legal thanks to substantial noninfringing uses bmg then tried to use the grokster ruling on inducement to undermine what the supreme court said in sony here ogrady decides that the sony ruling was a narrow one thats a problem ogrady says that because cox has an ongoing relationship with potential infringers rather than ending that relationship at the point of sale the sony standard doesnt apply such a claim is possible here because unlike in sony cox maintains an ongoing relationship with users of its service sonys last point of contact with users of the vtr was at the point of sale an ongoing relationship between a defendant and direct infringers presents a potential for culpability quite beyond distribution or design the judge also rejects the in the alternative argument presented by cox that even if sony doesnt apply under grokster the only way to apply liability is if cox was found to have induced infringement remember the supreme court in the grokster case made up  out of thin air  an inducement standard to explain why groksters file sharing system wasnt protected by the sony ruling here however ogrady takes the grokster ruling to mean not just that theres an inducement standard but rather as open season to come up with reasons why the sony standard doesnt apply yikes cox also argues that if sony does not provide immunity the grokster court made clear that bmgs only path to liability was through an inducement claim the court again disagrees it bears noting that adopting coxs reading of sony and grokster would greatly simplify this area of law sony would be a complete bar to contributory infringement whenever a defendants product or service is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses and that safe harbor would be removed for only a distinct subsetthose that actively induce infringement well yeah thats what the courts have said whats so terrible about that reading of the law it makes perfect sense instead ogrady wants the law to be something different  allowing courts to shut down services with substantial noninfringing uses by pinning liability based on vague other claims thats problematic on a number of levels as it almost writes the sony ruling out of existence as an aside in a footnote ogrady notes that if the appeals court disagrees with him on this point the case is effectively over as bmg didnt claim that cox engaged in inducement until after the case was over which he notes correctly is far too little and far too late finally on the question of whether or not cox was willfully blind to infringement on its network ogrady again takes a very expansive and troubling view of what he believes the law says while multiple courts have taken the quite reasonable view that willful blindness requires actual knowledge of infringing behavior ogrady goes with a broader definition and takes jokey emails from coxs abuse team as proof that it knew of infringement and then combined that with the fact that rightscorp bombarded cox with notices whose sole purpose was not to stop the infringement but rather in hopes that cox would pass them on to subscribers to get those subscribers to cough up money but judge ogrady takes coxs decision to treat rightscorp notices more like spam as a sign of willful blindness there was a significant amount of evidence of coxs general knowledge of infringement on its network cox received notices from other copyright holders complaining of infringement cox knew from its traffic analysis that subscribers were using bittorrent there was evidence from industry reports that the overwhelming majority of traffic on bittorrent was infringing and emails among members of the abuse group indicated coxs knowledge of that fact bittorrent is used for one thing only and i would know   of dmca violations is from people using pp on purpose and not trojan activity while generalized knowledge of infringement occurring on its network is not sufficient standing alone it did provide the backdrop for coxs decision to continuously ignore and take no action in response to the  million notices weekly letters and dashboard from rightscorp there was also evidence that cox had configured its graduated response system in such a way as to reduce both the total number of notices that entered the system and the amount of customerfacing action that may be required moreover internal cox communications which were admitted over coxs objections signaled that coxs decision not to process rightscorps notices may have been due to more than just the presence of the settlement language and instead reflected a general disdain for any enforcement responsibilities again ogrady reads this in the worst possible light but an isp should have disdain for copyright holders trying to lump all the liability on them the whole idea that everyone thinks isps should be hollywoods private police force is silly and its why the safe harbors of the dmca are designed to keep most of the liability off of the isps not surprisingly ogrady also rejects all of coxs complaints about the jury instructions and the exclusion of certain evidence this included ogradys decision to block evidence of righscorps seriously scammy behavior  such as its phone script telling people who said they hadnt infringed that they needed to hand their computers over to the local police to search the hard drives ogrady says he was right to exclude that evidence because it might unfairly prejudice or confuse the jury basically the only thing that goes coxs way is ogradys decision to deny bmgs request for a permanent injunction at the outset the court notes that bmgs brief in support of an injunction relied heavily on a statement of fact that was not true specifically bmg alleged that following the jury verdict cox had continued to ignore rightscorps detection of massive infringement on its network  in fact cox provided notice to bmg shortly after trial that righscorp was no longer blacklisted the court goes on to note that bmgs request for an injunction is overly broad and extreme and would basically allow rightscorp to kick people off of coxs service with little oversight hilariously bmg also demands that cox hand over the identity email address mailing address and telephone number of every subscriber that bmg identifies which is basically please let us let rightscorp play its shakedown game thankfully the court rejects that too and laughs off bmgs claim that this is necessary for transparency quite obviously if that were the reason there would be numerous ways to anonymize subscribers and still track coxs actions there certainly would never be a need for an email address mailing address and telephone numbers when asked counsel conceded that the infromation would be given to rightscorp anyway all of this is just prelude anyway it seems highly likely that cox will appeal this decision though its also possible that it will come to some sort of settlement agreement with bmg its the appeal where all of this will become especially

butofcourse dept this wasnt a huge surprise after judge liam ogradys questionable reading of the dmca a few weeks back along with his general disdain for the internet but a jury yesterday awarded bmg  million from cox communications claiming that cox was guilty of willful contributory infringement in not kicking accused file sharers off the internet the jury found cox not guilty of vicarious liability which is at least marginally surprising as many people who dont spend their lives wrapped up in copyright law have difficulty distinguishing the difference between contributory infringement and vicarious if youre confused too wikipedias overview is a decent place to start and based on that the jury hit cox with the  million award for bmg this will undoubtedly go to appeal and it would seem that cox has some pretty strong arguments first up the original decision that cox is not subject to the dmcas safe harbors is a highly questionable ruling and would go against a number of previous rulings as noted previously some of coxs actions did seem somewhat egregious but this still involves a previously untested argument that the policy of requiring service providers to have a plan to terminate users applies to network service providers rather than those who host content thats a pretty big open question  and how that issue is resolved will have a major impact on how the internet functions going forward if judge ogradys ruling stands then the riaa and mpaa just got a huge golden gift it would effectively say that the us has a three strikeslike law where people can be kicked off the internet entirely based solely on accusations of copyright infringement thats a pretty scary result even separate from that the idea that cox an internet service provider is guilty of contributory liability for infringement seems difficult to believe as well the standard for contributory copyright infringement is basically one who knowingly induces causes or materially contributes to copyright infringement done by someone else where that party had knowledge or reason to know of infringement so in this case the argument is that based on the notifications cox had the necessary knowledge of the infringement and then materially contributed to that infringement by continuing to provide service but again thats a huge stretch and goes way beyond historical examples of contributory infringement where you had things like grokster that actively advertised its software as being useful for infringement in this case all cox did was not terminate users and somehow that counts as materially contributing to infringement again if that stands it has tremendously troubling implications for how the internet functions and the ability of people to use copyright law to wreak havoc on the lives of others were talking about opening up the possibility of going way beyond the standard dmca takedowns of content to it becoming a weapon for killing internet access within households the  million verdict comes out to about  per each of the  copyrights listed in the case  which is certainly less than the statutory maximum possibility of  per infringement but still either

safe harbor concerning a repeat infringer policy at the time he only said he would explain his reasons later and late yesterday he released his full opinion it unfortunately brings to mind the phrase hard cases make bad law as we explained when bmg and round hill music with the help of rightscorp first sued cox communications the company seemed like a slightly odd choice while it was the largest of the internet access providers not to sign onto the socalled voluntary sixstrikes copyright alert system hammered out between the riaampaa and big isps it already had a reputation for actually disconnecting those accused of repeat infringements none of the other major isps do that in fact a key prong of the whole six strikes thing was that no one would be getting kicked off the internet however the riaa has long insisted that the dmcas i required isps to kick people off the internet  even as that theory had never really been tested until now many others had assumed is repeat infringer policy only really referred to service providers who actually had direct control over content  ie a youtube or soundcloud style site kicking people entirely off the internet because one person who uses their account to infringe is quite draconian the issue here however gets muddied because cox made such a mess of its repeat infringer policy yes it alone among the major isps will kick people off but and this is the important bit its internal policy was apparently to kick people off and then allow them to sign right back up for new service at which point the count on infringements would be reset to  for obvious reasons that feels pretty sketchy and its the key point that judge ogrady focuses on doing something that feels sketchy will often obscure the more important legal arguments judge ogrady basically tosses aside all the other issues because of this bad behavior by cox as immortalized in some internal emails the record conclusively establishes that before the fall of  cox did not implement its repeat infringer policy instead cox publicly purported to comply with its policy while privately disparaging and intentionally circumventing the dmca’s requirements cox employees followed an unwritten policy put in place by senior members of cox’s abuse group by which accounts used to repeatedly infringe copyrights would be nominally terminated only to be reactivated upon request once these accounts were reactivated customers were given clean slates meaning the next notice of infringement cox received linked to those accounts would be considered the first in cox’s graduate response procedure numerous emails in the record portions of which are reproduced below support these conclusions even viewed in the light most favorable to cox the court finds the contents of the emails cannot be explained away cox’s attempts to recast the emails are unavailing nor can they be pinned on low level employees whose views had no real significance the name that appears again and again on these emails is jason zabek cox’s manager of customer abuse operations in  zabek sent an email titled “dmca terminations” to the abuse group that said as we move forward in this challenging time we want to hold on to every subscriber we can with this in mind if a customer is terminated for dmca you are able to reactivate them after you give them a stern warning about violating our aup and the dmca we must still terminate in order for us to be in compliance with safe harbor but once termination is complete we have fulfilled our obligation after you reactivate them the dmca ‘counter’ restarts the procedure restarts with the sending of warning letters just like a first offense this is to be an unwritten semipolicy    we do not talk about it or give the subscriber any indication that reactivating them is normal use your best judgment and remember to do what is right for our company and subscribers    this only pertains to dmca violations it does not pertain to spammers hackers etc and based on that the court decides that cox does not have a reasonably implemented termination policy for repeat infringers there are a bunch of other similar emails indicating that this absolutely was coxs policy of course all of that obscures the question of whether or not i is meant to apply to access providers rather than online service providers separately the judge buys bmgs claim that in late  cox actually stopped terminating accounts almost entirely leaving aside again that no other major access provider terminates anyone again some questionable internal behavior by cox comes back to bite them the judge highlights a case where cox internally kept discussing a user who was frequently accused of infringing and who they threatened to cut off but didnt  even admitting its at least partly because of the large amount of money the customer pays in june a senior engineer in the abuse group said this about a customer who had been given a final suspension and advised to remove all pp filesharing programs “this customer will likely fail again but let’s give him one more change sic he pays  a month” the judge uses this and other examples to note that cox knew of repeat infringers but didnt terminate them of course the vague language of i doesnt say that you have to terminate someone as soon as you know theyre repeat infringers  just that you have a reasonably implemented policy however judge ogrady uses these examples to suggest the policy implementation is not reasonable coxs defense to that is it cant know for sure if people are infringing based solely on accusations this is correct but judge ogrady doesnt care although cox was under no duty to monitor for infringement cox did not have leeway to wait until an account holder was adjudicated as an infringer to find that circumstances were appropriate for termination as explained above the court disagrees that a repeat infringer policy applies only to those who have been held liable in a copyright suit rather an account holder must be considered an infringer at minimum when the service provider has actual knowledge that the account holder is using its services for infringing purposes nor do service providers have complete discretion to define “appropriate circumstances” appropriate circumstances arise when an account holder is repeatedly or flagrantly infringing copyrights thus when cox had actual knowledge of particular account holders who blatantly or repeatedly infringed the responsibility shifted to cox to terminate their accounts that alone is quite troubling kicking people off the internet based merely on accusations of infringement is really dangerous especially given the number of false infringement allegations that we see the one good thing is that the court rejects bmgs troubling definition of making available this has been a fight thats been going on for ages copyright law says that one of the exclusive rights given to a copyright holder is the distribution right what is not settled law at all is whether or not making available violates this distribution right or if copyright holders have to show actual distribution the courts are somewhat split on this with ogrady recognizing that merely making available is not distribution at the threshold the court questions the evidence relied on by those courts that purportedly establishes that distribution is interchangeable with publication those courts build upon comments in legislative history as well as an excerpt from the supreme court’s decision in harper  row publishers inc v nation enterprises legislative history cannot override the plain meaning of “distribution” under §  however and harper  row involved a narrow discussion of first publication and not the meaning of distribution and publication generally nor does the definition of “publication” support a broader reading of the distribution right the act defines “publication” as the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending the offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution public performance or public display constitutes publication the first sentence of the definition tracks the language in §  making it clear that all distributions are publications it does not follow from that proposition that the inverse—all publications are distributions—is also true in short §  provides no support for bmg’s “making available” theory theres some more in the ruling but it seems pretty clear that coxs own internal emails and policies really sunk the company here and out of that could come some potentially dangerous law some have been making a big deal over the fact that coxs insurance company beazly has filed for declaratory judgment that its not responsible for any judgment in this case  but again that seems to focus on coxs own actions which may not apply more broadly to other providers also important is the fact that the trial still is about to go forward losing the safe harbor protections does not necessarily mean that cox will lose the overall case but its an ominous start judge ogradys rulings and statements so far certainly do not bode well for the company its also a little bit ridiculous that ogrady focuses so much on coxs bad behavior but leaves out rightscorps much worse behavior  but i can see where hes coming from in the end this is unfortunate and its certain that this case will be appealed no matter how it turns out but the bad behavior by cox poisons the well a bit in terms of focusing on the rather important question of what i actually means and whether it really applies to internet access providers as it stands right now however a potentially dangerous precedent could be set whereby people could be forced to completely lose internet access based on mere accusations of copyright infringement its hard to believe that congress intended such a result but thats how judge ogrady is now reading the law read more   comments read more copyright by mike masnickfri nov th  pm filed under i copyright

rightscorpbyproxy lawsuit against cox communications the key issue rightscorp on behalf of bmg and round hill music flooded cox communications with infringement notices trying to shake loose ip addresses as part of its shake down cox wasnt very happy about cooperating and in response bmg and round hill sued cox claiming that i of the dmca requires isps to kick people off the internet if theyre found to be repeat infringers historically it has long been believed that i does not apply to internet accessbroadband providers like cox but rather to online service providers who are providing a direct service on the internet like youtube or medium or whatever however the riaa and its friends have hinted for a while that theyd like a court to interpret i to apply to internet access providers creating a defacto three strikes and you lose all internet access policy rightscorp with help from bmg and round hill music have decided to put that to the test this is a big big deal if the case goes against cox then it would create a massive problem for the public on the internet accusations of infringement could potentially lead to you totally losing access to the internet which could really destroy peoples lives given how important the internet is for work and life these days the details of the case look like they should favor cox pretty easily after all cox pointed out that rightscorp only had licenses from the publishes meaning they had no copyright in the sound recording  yet they admitted to downloading the sound recording suggesting that if anything rightscorp was a mass infringer on top of that there was pretty strong evidence that rightscorp does not act in good faith in how it runs its shakedown practice telling people that they have to take their computers to the police to prove their innocence really unfortunately as eriq gardner reports judge ogrady has ruled against cox on a very key point does its current policy grant it safe harbor under the dmca the judge said no though were still waiting for the full ruling as to why the bigger story is ogradys determination that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants reasonably implemented a repeatinfringer policy as is required by §i of the dmca granting a motion that cox is not entitled to a safe harbor defense now just because youre not protected by the safe harbor it does not mean that you are automatically guilty of infringement there are cases where sites have not qualified for the safe harbor and still prevailed but it does make things more difficult and complicated and much more importantly opens the door to lots and lots of mischief by the riaas and mpaas of the world to use this to kick people off the internet entirely based on accusations of copyright infringement thats immensely worrisome ogrady doesnt seem to think that kicking people off the internet is really a big deal earlier in the case weve discovered in the process of flat out rejecting an attempt by public knowledge and eff to file an amicus brief judge ogrady made his views clear i read the brief it adds absolutely nothing helpful at all it is a combination of describing the horrors that one endures from losing the internet for any length of time frankly it sounded like my son complaining when i took his electronics away when he watched youtube videos instead of doing homework and its completely hysterical thats his response to two well known public interest groups explaining to him the real world harmful effects of rightscorps copyright shakedown trolling business but he didnt want to hear any of it because protecting the ability of americans to not be the subjects of extortion schemes and to enable them to communicate and work is hysterical and no different from kids not doing their homework because of too much youtube the details here matter but i would imagine that cox is likely to appeal one hopes that the appeals court is more open to listening to the concerns over copyright trolling and kicking people off the internet  comments read more say that again by mike masnickmon sep th  am filed under copyright copyright trolling phone script police companies bmg cox communications rightscorp round hill music permalinkshort link rightscorps copyright trolling phone script tells innocent people they need to give their computers to policefrom the uhthatsnothowthisworks dept we already wrote about the various filings in the rightscorpbyproxy lawsuit against cox communications however mixed in with all the filings are some interesting tidbits and exhibits one that caught my eye was an exhibit revealing the script that rightscorp gives its agents to use when people call in after receiving a notice cox communications filed this in showing that the actual plaintiffs bmg and round hill music turned a blind eye to rightscorps misconduct the script is quite something with a few ridiculous statements the most ridiculous however is the following if the caller says that theyre innocent heres how rightscorp has its agents respond in order to cancel this matter without payment you will need to go and get a police report and fax or email it to us the police may take your devices and hold it for  days to investigate the matter you must be sure that it was not you anyone in your household including friends and neighbors or you will be breaking a different law with the police department every part of that statement is bullshit  and its clearly designed to do one thing only to frighten the caller into just paying up to tell totally innocent people that they need to hand over their computers to the police for five days and that if anyone else used their computer to infringe that theyll be violating some sort of criminal law is downright disgusting it just highlights that rightscorp is in the extortionshakedown business rather than actually trying to stop copyright infringement there is plenty of evidence that rightscorps targeting efforts were not that accurate and plenty of innocent people were swept up by its systems and to then target these  often unsophisticated  users and tell them they have to go to the police and could be breaking the law if someone else happened to use their computer is both sleazy and dishonest theres a similar script for users who claim they were hacked which still involves having to go to the police our clients appreciate that you believe you were hacked but the fact remains that we have evidence that a computer at ip address  has been distributing our clients product on the bittorrent network from  date to as recently as  your isp confirmed that this is your account there have been  infringements over a period of time in order to cancel this matter without payment you will need to go and get a police report and fax or email it to us the police may take your devices and hold them for  days to investigate the matter you must be sure that it was not you anyone in your household friends or neighbors as you may be breaking another law with the police department with this many infringements the only way we can cancel the matter without payment is if you get a police report and fax it to us if you fax us a police report we will close the matter the script also includes the usual misleading claims such as saying that people downloading songs have received penalties as high as  yes thats the maximum for statutory damages but only for willful infringement and such numbers have never been awarded for some random person just downloading some songs to suggest otherwise is clearly misleading similarly the script has the agents implying that rightscorps technology is never wrong in identifying users and furthermore falsely claiming that even if someone else used your wifi network that you are still responsible this is in direct contrast to the actual law on the matter distributing these composition on the bittorrent network violates us federal law  usc  which states that the copyright owner has the sole right to determine who may distribute their copyrights to the public more than  people have been sued for doing exactly this since  with penalties as high as  per infringement we send mails to isps like yours state their isp if available each time we see a computer illegally distributing our clients copyrighted works the isp looks up which subscriber was using the ip address at the time the infringement occurred and sends our notice to that subscriber if you are receiving our notices it is because your isp has identified you as the network that was used to illegally distribute our clients copyrighted material according the the acceptable use policy that most isps have the account holder is solely responsible for what occurs on their network regardless of who actually committed the infringement we are authorized by the copyright holders to extend offers of settlement in exchange for a release of liability from the infringement we are only contacting you while the settlement offer is still available at s per infringement we believe this is a much more financial friendly alternative would you like to settle these infringements now and of course there are all sorts of inaccuracies on little tidbits of copyright law a copyright holder does not have the sole right because there are exceptions and its not about the distribution of the copyrights but rather the distribution of the work which may be covered by copyright oh and the actual statutory damages are  per work infringed rather than per infringement which may sound like the same thing but isnt but those are just little inaccuracies compared to the bigger lies above the script also makes it clear that rightscorp will hound you until you pay and they threaten that your internet access may get cut off sir or maam i do need to let you know we will be continuing to contact you with all methods possible which will include email regular mail and phone calls until this is paid or our client decides to no longer offer the settlement this is a prelitigation communication once our client has removed the settlement we can no longer aid you in obtaining the release of liability this could potentially result in the suspension or termination of your internet escalation up to and including litigation its like the classic shakedown scheme

media isp subpoenas search search for dmca scare letters rightscorpall i know about rightscorp in one page april   houstonlawyr  comments rightscorp then and nowrightscorp inc has always been the bastard child of the riaa backed by the riaa rightscorp inc uses the digital millennium copyright act “dmca” to send dmca copyright notices to the accused music downloaders rightscorp has been known to strongarm the isps and force them to identify the account holders who allegedly downloaded copyrighted titles belonging to rightscorp inc clients  then they forward these accused downloaders multiple settlement demand notices threatening that they will be sued for  per instance of copyright infringement unless they pay a measly sum of rightscorp was the giant that woke up in rightscorp inc came on my radar in june of  where i wrote the article “riaa giant waking up and luring defendants into settlements” at the time i wrote that article i was spending a considerable amount of time helping clients who received similar notices for adult films they allegedly downloaded but through copyright enforcement group cegtek another copyright monetization outfitrightscorp inc dmca letters ‘smelled’ like a trapknowing the dmca rules and the ways copyright holders enforced them something ‘smelled wrong’ with the rightscorp inc letters the rightscorp inc company aka “digital rights corp” itself seemed legitimate but the way they handled their dmca notices caused me to think that they were up to a scam i sensed that the  settlement letters were a trap and i recommended that recipients of those letters ignore them here is what i wrote in  on the topic“what is bothering me however is that the release on their httpssecuredigitalrightscorpcomsettle website pasted below releases the accused defendant from their claim of copyright infringement for a mere  but it has the defendant admitting guilt to the infringement thus in legal terms an accused internet user who pays the  may be released from liability for that instance of infringement but the next time they catch that user downloading they can not only sue for the full  or ask for tens of thousands of dollars as a settlement but in court they would use the prior settlement as evidence of guilt that the accused defendant habitually downloads copyrighted videos and tv showsto be clear every settlement agreement for copyright infringement should have language stating that the accused defendant is not admitting guilt or else the act of settling a copyright infringement claim can be construed as an “admission” of guilt in a court specifically the language eg taken from cegtek’s settlements would say something like “this liability release represents a compromise and that nothing herein is to be construed as an admission of liability on the part of releasee” this language appears to be purposefully absent from the rightscorp settlement agreements”rightscorp inc dmca settlement notices ended up being a trapi worried that a client who settled a rightscorp inc copyright infringement notice subjected himself to future claims of copyright infringements every settlement was an admission of guilt and it turned out that rightscorp inc sent many followup dmca notices to the individual who paid their  feepay one notice receive twenty morethose who paid the dmca settlement notices on their own often ended up calling me when they received twenty more dmca settlement notices for a while i thought that this was part of their elaborate plan of eliciting hundreds of dollars from each defendant rather than a onetime payment of  unlike cegtek who at the time would list all of the alleged claims against a particular user in real time based on the ip addresses they allegedly used to download the copyrighted content rightscorp inc asked for one settlement at a time and when you settled one there was often another one right behind itthe rightscorp scam in my opinion did not start until rightscorp inc started to ask its users for settlements in the thousands of dollars while the numbers never matched cegtek settlements where cegtek was asking for  per title rightscorp settlement numbers often found themselves hovering near the  rangesettling one instance of infringement vs settling all past downloads of a titlethe reason rightscorp was able to increase their settlement amounts was because each settlement was for “one instance of copyright infringement” which means that if a user downloaded the file twice they had to pay twice if they left their bittorrent software on overnight and that bittorrent software seeded  copies of a title to  downloaders that accused downloader would be accused of  more instances of infringementthis was very different from cegtek who allowed their settlements to cover “all past instances of infringement regarding that copyrighted title”rightscorp inc then used settlements to force isps to shut accountsrightscorp then used the admissions of guilt within the settlement agreements to attempt to strongarm the isps to shut down their internet accountsi always thought this was a petty move i understood that there were some politicians behind the digital rights corp  rightscorp entity and that those politicians had no idea how to run a company which is why rightscorp stock has been worth only a few pennies for years now i also understood that rightscorp inc motives were not at first to extort money from the accused downloaders such as a copyright troll would but rather they wanted to protect their music labels and stop piracyi understand and respect a company who legitimately tries to stop piracy but rightscorp inc went about it in the wrong way i always thought that rightscorp pressuring the isps to shut down the internet accounts of those who paid a settlement ransom was vindictive to me it just showed the callous disregard for the power rightscorp wielded like a child who swings a light saber at his infant unsuspecting brotherthen rightscorp inc started robocalling accused downloadersrightscorp then started ‘robocalling’ accused downloaders they did it recklessly — again think of a child whacking his infant brother with a lightsaber — and they broke a whole slew of laws in the process in addition they called at all hours of the night and because the company was in my opinion a ‘headless’ company meaning that there was nobody to call to complain or help resolve a situation the rightscorp harassment issues only got worse eventually they were sued in a class action lawsuit and had to pay a hefty settlement for their robocalling shenanigansthen rightscorp inc started suing accused downloaders for i must admit i lost interest in the rightscorp shenanigans after i noted that their settlement agreements do not protect the legal rights of those who settle because their settlements amounted to admissions of guilt thus when someone asked me “should i pay rightscorp inc” my answer was “not without a valid release that doesn’t have you admitting guilt”however there was a point that rightscorp inc started filing copyright infringement lawsuits against accused music downloaders in federal court each accused defendant was sued for  statutory damages for the unlawful download of the various music titles they allegedly downloaded via bittorrentrightscorp defendants deceptively are not told that it is rightscorp who is suing them  rather they will receive a subpoena relating to some ‘motion to compel’ that they have filed in a federal court  their subpoenas force the isp to hand over account information to a place called “inquest resources” at  brazos street suite  in austin tx  the subpoenas usually come with a declaration by dennis j hawk of the business law group under the  usc h statutei don’t have much to say here except that jordan rushie was one of the attorneys who was hired by rightscorp to file the lawsuits if i was looking for it the jordan rushie connection with carl crowell and rights enforcement was something that i did not make until writing “the great mpaariaa scheme to defraud copyright law” in march rightscorp then reckless copyright trollall i could say about rightscorp is that is has been a trainwreck first with the bad settlement agreements then with the unruly wielding of power to shut down isp accounts of infringers then the ‘headless’ robocalls then the copyright infringement lawsuits rightscorp was a reckless copyright troll and i always sensed that the leadership was delegating orders the management simply could not carry out  to make matters worse rightscorp was in financial ruin at one point before what appears to have been a ‘cash infusion’ which brought them out of their consistent negative cashflow and i used to refer to rightscorp as a “sinking ship”rightscorp now efficient copyright trollrightscorp in recent years has made a number of changes graduating them from a reckless copyright troll to an efficient copyright troll in recent years they have revamped their settlement agreements where there is no longer an admission of guilt they also now have a contact for an attorney such as myself to speak to that way if i have a client who is in trouble and wants to pay significantly less that they were accused of or if my client wants to settle anonymously at least now i have someone in rightscorp i can speak to in order to make this happeni have to assume they are still filing in the federal courts although their lawsuits do not get nearly the amount of publicity as other copyright troll lawsuits do probably because they are going after individual defendants and are suing in the name of the music copyright holder settlements are no longer  per instance of infringement but are now  per instance of infringement this is a  increase in their profits but for you or me it’s another  which thankfully is not  the going asking rate to settle movie download lawsuits with cegtek’s outofcourt dmca settlement letters was title most importantly they have stayed off the radar and have kept out of troublefrom the perspective of running our cashman law firm pllc in the past we used to decline representing rightscorp clients because their settlement agreements did not protect the interests of our clients  however with  the improvements in their settlement agreements in eliminating admissions of guilt  the ability to anonymously protect our clients’ interests  negotiate the dollar amount of the settlements and  the ability to negotiate the settlement agreement itself to tailor it to the needs of our clients today our firm does represent rightscorp clientshowever doing so does not come with a bit of awkwardness  when representing a client in a cegtek dmca settlement demand notice clients would come with  notices and at claim the settlement asking price was  before settlement negotiations  thus representing a client and having the client pay our fees made sensenot necessarily so with a rightscorp client who received those same  notices  at claim the settlement asking price would be  before settlement negotiations  thus depending on the number of notices there could be a disproportionate payment to our law firm to handle what could be a  problemfor more on this topic click the “rightscorp settlement attorney considerations for a set of dmca notices” article herehow to handle a rightscorp notice todayrightscorp inc is still a failing company from the point of view of corporate earnings and management however from the point of view of an accused downloader of a jethro tull music album or some other piece of music you must assume that failing to settle could put you at risk of being sued for copyright infringement in federal court all this being said when you receive the letter the rightscorp problem still small and can be managed with the assistance of a lawyer myself or anyone elsehow an attorney would represent you in resolving your rightscorp matternote for credibility purposes be aware that since  i recommended that if rightscorp is unwilling to protect your interests in a settle do not settle if you get sued hire an attorney again me or someone else because rightscorp lawsuits likely have the same guardaley “no evidence” problem i described here now that rightscorp inc is willing to help me protect your interests in a settlement i am willing to settle rightscorp cases for clients here is why to retain a lawyer and what we would do for you  below when i speak of “you” i am speaking in a general way i do not become your attorney nor should this be considered legal advice until we sign a contract togethernext step schedule a consultationfollow the three steps below to begin working with a cashman law firm pllc patent attorney schedule a phone appointment to speak to a patent attorney about your matter get sign and return retainer agreement sit back relax and let us work on your behalf to get you the results you needafter scheduling your appointment online you will be contacted by phone at the specified date and time by a cashman law firm pllc attorneyanonymous settlementremember when you receive the dmca notice from your internet provider you are anonymous and you should stay that way rightscorp has enough of a history to have me recommend that every client of mine who settles does so anonymouslystop rightscorp from sending additional dmca notices after a settlementthere should be a legal barrier between you and rightscorp and hiring an attorney and having me put them on notice that i am representing your account stops them from contacting you in the future also any future communications or additional dmca notices should come through me as i am the attorney representing you by having me represent you we ‘discourage’ rightscorp from sending any additional dmca notices after a settlement is complete rather we ask them to research to see whether there are any outstanding titles claimed against you and we would include them in the settlement negotiationsnegotiate the settlement facilitate the anonymous paymentyou would have me review and negotiate the claims with rightscorp when they agree to lower the price to something you are comfortable paying i would facilitate the settlement to make it an anonymous settlementreview release of liabilitythis is an obvious step to be done before we pay the settlement on your behalf i am giving this section its own heading because sometimes custom terms need to be inserted into the rightscorp agreements to protect a client’s interests this would be part of the settlement negotiations abovehandle any followup communications from rightscorpthis last step happens after the settlement is complete and we do not charge our clients for this when we

email tweet share share  pinshares   thoughts on “all i know about rightscorp in one page” i’m confused…in rightscorp’s case isn’t it the clients they represent that would have to “sue” or pursue an infringer in court not rightscorp itself reply the copyright holders themselves would be the ones that would ordinarily file the lawsuits for themselves however as we see with voltage pictures who sued as dallas buyers club and the guardaley lawsuits there are ‘common troll’ entities who license the rights to enforce other people’s copyrights rightscorp can thus contract the rights to enforce and sue on behalf of their client the copyright holders you will correctly point out that this could cause a number of issues eg doesn’t the person suing need to have the copyright etc and the answer is yes thus the lawsuits would not have rightscorp as the plaintiff reply leave a reply cancel replyyour email address will not be published required fields are marked commentname  email  website fill
