acquisition of the assets technology and patents pending of privately owned auction video inc a utah corporation and auction video japan inc a tokyojapan corporation collectively auction video subsequent to this acquisition we began pursuing the final approval of the patent pending application and in march  retained the law firm of hunton  williams to assist in expediting the patent approval process and to help protect rights related to proprietary onstream technology in april  we revised the original patent application primarily for the purpose of splitting it into two separate applications the original applications which while related would be evaluated separately by the us patent and trademark office uspto the patents address live streaming of audio andor video from multiple devices to a storage location such as the internet or cloud and the ability to access and retrieve the audio andor video to multiple devices whereby the content is not stored on the device in our q as of june   and for the nine months then ended filed by us on october   we set forth the status of these patents pending including related patents that were subsequently issued to us and we hereby incorporate that information by reference on february   we entered into a patent purchase agreement the agreement with mr eriya unten a resident of japan and an unrelated thirdparty the buyer for our sale of us patents nos  and  and related us patent applications nos  and  which sale includes our entire right title and interest in such patents and the rights if any to the related patent applications the causes of action to sue for infringement thereof and any other legal rights entitled by the original owner of the patents and patent applications under the law in accordance with the agreement the total purchase price is a minimum of  million and a maximum of  million to be paid to the parties as set forth below      million of the purchase price has been received by us in the form of a nonrefundable deposit  of the deposit was received by us on february   and the  balance was received by us on february   this deposit was received pursuant to a february  letter of intent between us and the buyer although the letter of intent outlined significant aspects of the patent sale it was contingent among other things on the execution of a revenue distribution agreement which execution was effective on february   and is discussed in further detail below the letter of intent was replaced by the agreement     an additional  million payment against the purchase price is due on or before march   in the event this amount is not paid by that date we have agreed to grant buyer a  day extension but no later than may   to meet the purposes of obtaining and closing bank financing in connection with the transaction and in which case we have agreed with buyer to modify the payment schedule in an updated agreement the agreement states that the general  day cure period provided in the agreement for all other defaults shall not apply to this extension thus in the event that the buyer does not make the payment within the extended time period we will have the right to cancel the agreement and retain the nonrefundable deposit once an escrow agreement is finalized between the parties the documents assigning the patents and patent applications to the buyer will be placed in escrow and will be transferred from escrow to the buyer once this  million is paid into escrow  of this amount or  million will be paid to us from escrow and the other  will be paid to the former owners these amounts will be adjusted to allow for reimbursement of any additional patent related expenses to the extent allowed by the distribution agreement         additional contingent purchase price is payable calculated as  of any excess of certain defined revenues received by the buyer and related to the patents and patent applications over  million provided such additional purchase price will not exceed  million buyer is obligated to keep accurate records in this regard and we have the right to inspect such records with the costs of any such inspection including but not limited to any costs incurred for our accountants andor attorneys shall be borne by the buyer in the event that errors or omissions are found also in such case adjustments shall not prejudice our rights to seek any appropriate remedies including any rights to terminate the agreement   all of the costs incurred by us in connection with the patents and the patent applications have been expensed on our books and therefore the carrying value of the patents and the patent applications was zero on our most recently reported balance sheet dated june   as well as of the current date the agreement

the acquired patents pending effective february   we entered into a revenue distribution agreement distribution agreement with those former owners which by its terms superseded and replaced that previous interest as provided by the distribution agreement we paid  of the  million nonrefundable deposit to the former owners which included  for the reimbursement of estimated previously incurred patent related expenses the remaining  which included the reimbursement of  of our previously incurred patent related expenses was retained by us and utilized for working capital per the distribution agreement  of all future purchase price installments received by us will be payable to the former owners after reimbursement of any additional patent related expenses to the extent allowed by the distribution agreement under the terms of the distribution agreement the former owners have agreed that if we find it necessary to agree to modifications of the agreement we may do so at our sole discretion and judgement the former owners have also agreed that in the instance of a modification to the agreement that the schedule of payments outlined above may change and that payments to the
