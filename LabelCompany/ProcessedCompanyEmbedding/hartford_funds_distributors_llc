finraorg skip to main content you are herehomefor industry professionalsrules and guidanceguidance interpretive letter to edward p macdonald hartford funds distributors llc may   edward p macdonald executive vice president deputy general counsel hartford funds distributors llc  radnor corporate center  matsonford road suite  radnor pa   re provision of related performance information to institutional investors dear mr macdonald in your letter of may   you request interpretive guidance on behalf of hartford funds distributors llc “hartford funds” an underwriter and wholesale distributor of registered mutual funds regarding the use of related performance information as defined below in communications that are distributed solely to institutional investors as that term is defined in finra rule a  for purposes of this request “related performance information” means actual performance of all separate or private accounts or funds that have i substantially similar investment policies objectives and strategies and ii are currently managed or were previously managed by the same adviser or subadviser that manages the registered mutual fund that is the subject of an institutional communication  background you state that hartford funds markets registered mutual funds on a wholesale basis to financial intermediaries who qualify as “institutional investors” under finra rule a  these intermediaries include registered brokerdealers and investment advisers who may sell or recommend hartford funds’ funds to their customers  the registered brokerdealers assume related suitability and “know your customer” obligations for any such sales and recommendations  the financial intermediaries are responsible for conducting due diligence on the mutual funds that hartford funds sells and in some cases determining whether to include these funds on various types of platforms  you state that in addition to providing mutual fund offering materials hartford funds provides financial intermediaries with written and electronic communications regarding the mutual funds which assist these intermediaries in understanding the funds  as the marketplace for fund information has evolved hartford funds increasingly is receiving requests from financial intermediaries for related performance information  you state that intermediaries request related performance information to analyze and conduct due diligence on mutual funds portfolio managers accounts or particular investment strategies and to determine if funds and strategies are appropriate and suitable investments for their customers  you further state that in cases where a mutual fund has no or only a limited performance history related performance information may be a particularly critical data point in evaluating the fund hartford funds proposes to use related performance information only under the following conditions this performance information may be provided only if it is actual performance of all separate or private accounts or funds that have i substantially similar investment policies objectives and strategies and ii are managed or were previously managed by the same adviser or subadviser that manages the registered mutual fund that is the subject of an institutional communication hartford funds will provide materials with related performance information only to persons who qualify as “institutional investors” under finra rule a excluding institutional investors who intend to share the related performance information with persons other than institutional investors the presentation of related performance information will include all accounts described in the first condition related accounts if there are multiple related accounts the investment performance of such accounts will be presented in a composite or a list in which the investment performance of each account will be displayed with equal prominence any institutional communication with related performance information will be clearly labeled “for use with institutions only not for use with retail investors”  hartford funds will instruct institutional investors who receive such materials not to provide them to current or prospective customers or others who are not institutional investors  the presentation of related performance information will disclose performance information that is net of fees and expenses of related accounts or net of a model fee that is the highest fee charged to any account managed in the strategy  if gross performance information is also provided the institutional communication will prominently disclose that i the performance information does not reflect the deduction of fees and expenses ii different funds and accounts have different fees and expenses and iii that the related performance information would have been lower to the extent the related funds or accounts were subject to higher fees and expenses  the fees and expenses of the registered fund that is the subject of the institutional communication will be prominently disclosed and this fund’s performance information will reflect all fees and expenses  if the fees and expenses are higher than the fees and expenses of the related accounts that fact will be disclosed related performance information will i include the performance of each related account ii be for a period of at least one year and since the inception of the investment strategy and iii be current as of the most recentlyended calendar quarter related performance information will be clearly labeled as such and contain clear disclosure of the applicable dates for the performance for a mutual fund in existence for more than one year its actual performance will be displayed more prominently than the related performance information the institutional communications will disclose any material differences between the funds or accounts for which related performance information is provided and the mutual fund that is the subject of the institutional communication  all institutional communications that contain related performance information shall comply with all other applicable finra rules and federal securities laws and be subject to the same supervisory requirements that hartford funds applies to all other firm communications discussion finra rule  subjects institutional communications to certain content and supervision standards  in particular institutional communications must be fair and balanced and must provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts in regard to any particular security  institutional communications may not omit material information include false exaggerated or misleading statements or misstate material facts  a firm must establish written procedures for the review of institutional communications by a registered principal that are appropriate to the firm’s business size structure and customers  when those procedures do not require priortouse review the firm must adopt training and surveillance procedures to ensure compliance with the rule finra has taken the position in the past that the presentation of related performance information in communications with the public in some cases may be inconsistent with the content standards of rule d however finra has also recognized that communications provided solely to institutional investors do not raise the same investor protection concerns as sales materials provided to retail investors and finra has permitted member firms to provide certain related performance information to certain institutional investors with appropriate safeguards  in particular in  finra stated that it would not object if a member firm included related performance information in sales materials for private funds relying on section c of the investment company act of  “ica” if the information was made available only to qualified purchasers as defined in the ica and the member firm complied with all other applicable standards in nasd rule  finra staff believes that the same rationale used in the  interpretive letter to conclude that it was consistent with the applicable standards of nasd rule  to include related performance information in sales material for private funds relying on section c of the ica applies in this context  accordingly finra staff believes that the use of related performance information in institutional communications in the manner proposed in your letter is consistent with the applicable standards of finra rule   while we do not object to the use of related performance information in institutional communications as discussed herein this letter does not affect finra’s longstanding position that the presentation of related performance information other than the performance of a predecessor private account or fund as described above in communications used with retail investors does not comply with finra rule d the opinions expressed in this letter are staff opinions only and have not been reviewed or endorsed by the finra board of governors  this staff letter responds only to the issues raised and does not address any other rule or interpretation of finra or all the possible regulatory and legal issues involved if you have any questions regarding this letter please contact me at   or joe savage at   sincerely   joseph e price
