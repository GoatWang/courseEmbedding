will almost always vary sometimes materially from any estimates predictions projections assumptions or other future performance suggested herein except as required by applicable law including the securities laws of the united states we do not intend to update any of the forwardlooking statements to conform these statements to actual results   as used in this report the terms “we” “us” and “our” mean solaris power cells inc a nevada corporation in this report unless otherwise specified all dollar amounts are expressed in united states dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock                corporate overview   we were formed as a nevada corporation “rolling technologies inc” on july   on august   we changed our name to solaris power cells inc effective august   we effected a  for  forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock our authorized common stock increased from  shares of common stock to  shares of common stock   we are developing a renewable energy storage device known as a “passive electron storage array” to market to residential and commercial industrial users we currently have developed a prototype of our solaris power cell which is a  leadfree solid state digital storage device our device provides a pcba printed circuit board assembly that creates an intelligent power cell creating digital energy storage solution capable of providing energy storage to applications normally reliant and equipped with highly toxic lead acid nickel metal hydride batteries our products can use any renewable or nonrenewable energy source including sun wind water motion or thermal to provide the energy to be stored to date we do not have any sales contracts   our system stores dc energy at a rate limited only by the network feeding it as it has efficiencies reaching  our product design allows for mass production and we anticipate it will compete head on with lead acid batteries   offgrid lithiumion and other battery types currently used in energy storage is limited in the flow of energy that can be accepted and stored at any given time and suffer from deficiencies such as shortlifecycles and are a hazardous waste product in a typical battery only a percentage of the energy sent to the battery is accepted the balance is wasted our product is anticipated to accept close to  of its storage capacity very quickly because our charging process is only limited by the network and not our technology   a normal battery can take hours to recharge whereas our product can recharge in significantly less time compared to similar voltage storage capacity a typical battery has a lifespan of  chargedischarge cycles whereas our product can have  chargedischarge cycles   solar panel manufacturers and other energy providers are working to maximize the amount of electrical power they can generate but they are losing that power to poor battery performance we hope we can provide a better solution to those manufactures for use by the end users and into new markets   we incorporate and implement a digital balancing design to insure the proper voltage is maintained on each power cell thus making each cell smart the energy is available to the regulator circuits that will regulate the output current and voltage the capacity of the storage transfer rate is not limited in voltage or current and is controlled by our intelligent power controller and can be configured per application the output of regulator section can be greater or less than the input voltage provided by the power cell the output from the power cell system is regulated ac or dc power provided to the connected electrical systems   results of operations   the following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended september   and september     revenues   we have limited operational history we do not anticipate earning adequate revenues until we procure additional financing to manufacture and market our products there is no assurance that we will earn adequate revenues or amounts that will enable us to continue as a going concern during the nine months ended september   and september   we generated  and  from the sale of inventory and experimental items   expenses   our operating expenses for the three months ended september   and  were  and  respectively the reduction of  or  was the result of managements’ decision to discontinue their salaries beyond december   minus additional costs attributed to the retention of outsourced consulting services and additional research and development on new products   operating expenses for the nine months ended september   were  including  of stock based compensation compared to  which included stock based compensation of  the increase in expenses was primarily the result of outsourcing consulting services to work on the development of our products                liquidity and capital resources   working capital as at september         as of     as of       september       december     current assets             current liabilities           working capital deficiency             our working capital deficiency increased from a deficiency of  to a working capital deficiency of  primarily as a result of continued operational costs additional stock based payroll costs and ongoing research and development   we have incurred operating losses since inception and this is likely to continue in the foreseeable future we require funds to enable us to address our minimum current and ongoing expenses   cash flows   during the nine months ended september   we used net cash in operating activities in the amount of  compared to  for the nine months ended september   the reduction in cash used in the nine months ended september   compared to the same nine months in  was primarily due to the reduction of cash paid for expenses associated with research and development advertising marketing accounting legal and wages   our cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended september   decreased to  from  as the result of a reduction in the sales of common stock   no cash was used for investing activities during the nine months ended september   as compared to  during the nine months ended september     going concern   we anticipate that our cash on hand will not be sufficient to satisfy all of our cash requirements for the next twelve month period we currently do not have committed sources of additional financing and may not be able to obtain additional financing particularly if the volatile conditions in the stock and financial markets persist if we require any additional financing we plan to raise any such additional capital primarily through equity financing and loans from our directors provided that such funding continues to be available to our company we plan to continue to seek additional funds from our directors to fund our daytoday operations until equity financing can be pursued we have no guarantee that our directors will continue to fund our daytoday operations the issuance of additional equity securities by our company may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations or that additional financing will be available to us when needed or if available that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms if we are not able to obtain additional financing as required on a timely basis we will not be able to meet certain obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations   future financings   we will require additional financing to fund our planned operations including further development regulatory requirements and commercializing our existing assets we currently do not have committed sources of additional financing and may not be able to obtain additional financing particularly if the volatile conditions in the stock and financial markets and more particularly the market for early development stage company stocks persist   there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or if available that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms if we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis if and when it is needed we will be forced to delay or scale down some or all of our development activities or perhaps even cease the operation of our business                since inception we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect that we will continue to fund our operations through the equity and debt financing if we raise additional financing by issuing equity securities our existing stockholders’ ownership will be diluted obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments   there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his her or its investment in our common stock further we may continue to be unprofitable   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors   risks associated with our business   we will encounter manufacturing risks and may face product liability claims   our manufacture and sale of battery systems may expose us to significant risk of product liability claims we may obtain product liability insurance but such coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we may incur or we may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance at acceptable rates if a product liability claim or series of claims were brought against us for uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insurance coverage and it is ultimately determined that we are liable we may be liable to pay the claim which could exceed the resources available to us in addition we could experience some material design or manufacturing failure a quality system failure other safety issues or heightened regulatory scrutiny that may warrant a recall of our products a recall of any of our products could also result in increased product liability claims and damage to our reputation   since we lack a meaningful operating history it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business   our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business or prospective operations we are subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization financing expenditures complications and delays inherent in a new business investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by new companies in an intensely competitive industry our business is dependent upon the implementation of our business plan as well as our ability to enter into agreements with third parties for among other things the manufacturing of our products on commercially favorable terms there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to attain profitability   we may not be able to achieve commercialization of any products on the timetable we anticipate or at all   we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to develop commercially viable battery systems on the timetable we anticipate or at all the continued commercialization of our battery system requires substantial technological advances to improve the efficiency functionality durability reliability cost and performance of these products and to develop commercial volume manufacturing processes for our future products developing our technology may require substantial capital and we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate or secure sufficient funding on acceptable terms to pursue commercialization plans on a larger scale in addition before any product can be released to market it must be subjected to numerous field tests these field tests may encounter problems and delays for a number of reasons many of which are beyond our control if these field tests reveal technical defects or reveal that our potential products do not meet performance goals including useful life reliability and durability our commercialization schedule could be delayed and potential purchasers may decline to purchase future systems and products   the commercialization of our battery systems also may depend on our ability to significantly reduce the costs of future systems and products we cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently reduce the cost of these products versus existing technologies without reducing performance reliability and durability which would adversely affect consumers’ willingness to buy future products                we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute our business plan   the execution of our business plan poses many challenges and is based on a number of assumptions we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute our business plan narrowing the scope of our development activities may not accelerate product commercialization if we experience significant cost overruns on any of our product development programs or if our business plan is more costly than anticipated certain research and development activities may be delayed or eliminated resulting in changes or delays to our commercialization plans   potential fluctuations in our financial and business results makes forecasting difficult and may restrict our access to funding for our commercialization plan   we expect our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and even year to year as a result quarter to quarter or year to year comparisons of these operating results are not expected to be meaningful due to our business’ stage of development it is difficult to predict potential future revenues if any or results of operations accurately it is likely that in one or more future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts if any who follow our company in addition investors or security analysts may misunderstand our business decisions or have expectations that are inconsistent with our business plan this may result in our business activities not meeting their expectations not meeting investor or security analyst expectations may materially and adversely impact the trading price of our common shares and increase the cost and restrict our ability to secure required funding to pursue our commercialization plans   a mass market for our products may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate   we do not know whether endusers will want to use our products the development of a mass market for our battery system may be affected by many factors some of which are beyond our control including the emergence of newer more competitive technologies and products the future cost of raw materials used by our systems regulatory requirements consumer perceptions of the safety of any developed products and consumer reluctance to buy a new product   if a mass market fails to develop or develops more slowly than anticipated we may be unable to recover the losses it will have incurred in the development of our current and potential future products and may never achieve profitability in addition we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop manufacture or market any products if sales levels do not support the continuation of those products   regulatory changes could hurt the market for our products   changes in existing government regulations and the emergence of new regulations with respect to our products may hurt the market for our future products environmental laws and regulations in the us and other countries have driven interest in alternate energy systems we cannot guarantee that these laws and policies will not change changes in these laws and other laws and policies or the failure of these laws and policies to become more widespread could result in consumers abandoning their interest in our products in favor of alternative technologies in addition as alternative energy products are introduced into the market the governments in countries we intend to market our products may impose burdensome requirements and restrictions on the use of these technologies that could reduce or eliminate demand for some or all of our potential products   if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights competitors may be able to use our technology which could weaken our competitive position eliminate the potential for future revenue and increase costs   we believe that our longterm success will depend to a large degree on our ability to protect the proprietary technology that we have developed or any other technology that we may develop or acquire in the future although we intend to aggressively pursue anyone we reasonably believe is infringing upon our intellectual property rights initiating and maintaining suits against third parties that may infringe upon those intellectual property rights will require substantial financial resources in addition significant financial resources could be required to defend against any suits brought against us claiming our infringement of others’ intellectual property rights we may not have the financial resources to bring or defend such suits and if such suits emerge we may not prevail regardless of our success in any such actions we could incur significant expenses in connection with such suits                failure to protect any intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business and prospects because we believe that developing new systems and products that are unique to us is critical to our success we will rely on patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property however some of the intellectual property may not be covered by any patent or patent application and certain patents will eventually expire we cannot assure that any present or future issued patents will protect the technology moreover our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity scope and enforceability of a particular patent accordingly there is no assurance that     ● any of the patents or patent applications developed acquired or licensed by us will not be invalidated circumvented challenged or rendered unenforceable or         ● any potential future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by us if issued at all   in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries   we may also seek to protect any proprietary intellectual property including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with strategic partners and employees we can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships   future intellectual property may be acquired without typical representations and warranties if necessary or desirable we may seek further licenses under the patents or other intellectual property rights of others however we can give no assurances that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for intellectual property we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the development manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the use of such intellectual property   we may be involved in intellectual property litigation that causes us to incur significant expenses or prevents us from selling any developed products   we may become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or commence lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing upon our rights involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense adversely affecting the development of the challenged product or intellectual property and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in its favor in the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation we may among other things be required to     ● pay substantial damages         ● cease the development manufacture use sale or importation of any developed products that infringe upon other patented intellectual property         ● expend significant resources to develop or acquire noninfringing intellectual property         ● discontinue processes incorporating infringing technology or         ● obtain licenses to the infringing intellectual property   we can provide no assurance that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available upon reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results                we will face significant competition   as alternative energy technologies have the potential to replace existing power products competition for those products will come from current power technologies from improvements to current power technologies and from new alternative power technologies including other types of alternative energy technologies each of our target markets is currently serviced by existing manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers these manufacturers use proven and widely accepted technologies   additionally there are competitors working on developing other technologies related to our system such as advanced lithiumion batteries and batteryfuel cell hybrids in each of our targeted markets some of these technologies are as capable of fulfilling existing and proposed regulatory requirements as our technology   there are many different individuals institutions and companies across the united states canada europe and japan including corporations national laboratories and universities that are actively engaged in the development and manufacture of alternative energy technologies each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in any of our future target markets   many of these competitors have substantial financial resources customer bases strategic alliances manufacturing marketing and sales capabilities and businesses or other resources which give them significant competitive advantages over our company   the loss of the services of certain key employees or the failure to attract additional key individuals would materially adversely affect our business   our success will depend on the continued services of certain technology development and marketing personnel in addition our success depends in large part on our ability in the future to attract and retain key management engineering scientific manufacturing and operating personnel recruiting personnel for the alternative energy industries is highly competitive we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain qualified executive managerial and technical personnel needed for the development of potential products business our failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity issues discussed earlier could severely impact our ability to attract qualified key personnel or retain existing personnel   new legislation including the sarbanesoxley act of  may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract officers and directors   the sarbanesoxley act of  was enacted in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with recent accounting scandals the stated goals of the sarbanesoxley act of  are to increase corporate responsibility to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws the sarbanesoxley act of  generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the securities exchange act of   upon becoming a public company we will be required to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of   the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act of  has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the sec that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officers the perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we continue to evaluate and monitor developments with respect to these rules and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs   risks associated with our financial condition   because our auditor has issued a going concern opinion regarding our company there is an increased risk associated with an investment in our company   we have incurred cumulative net losses of  since july   we have not attained profitable operations as of september   we had cash in the amount of  our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing or upon future profitable operations we reserve the right to seek additional funds through private placements of our common stock andor through debt financing our ability to raise additional financing is unknown we do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the advancement or loan of funds for these reasons our auditors stated in their report to our financial statements for the year ended december   that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern as a result there is an increased risk that you could lose the entire amount of your investment in our company                risks related to our securities   if a market for our common stock does not develop shareholders may be unable to sell their shares   a market for our common stock may never develop we are listed for trading on the otc bulletin board but have limited trading a public market may not materialize if a public market for our common stock does not develop investors may not be able to sell the shares of our common stock that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment   if we issue shares of preferred stock with superior rights than the common stock it could result in the decrease the value of our common stock and delay or prevent a change in control of us   our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock our board of directors has the power to establish the dividend rates liquidation preferences voting rights redemption and conversion terms and privileges with respect to any series of preferred stock the issuance of any shares of preferred stock having rights superior to those of the common stock may result in a decrease in the value or market price of the common stock holders of preferred stock may have the right to receive dividends certain preferences in liquidation and conversion rights the issuance of preferred stock could under certain circumstances have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of us without further vote or action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock   if a public market for our common stock develops short selling could increase the volatility of our stock price   short selling occurs when a person sells shares of stock which the person does not yet own and promises to buy stock in the future to cover the sale the general objective of the person selling the shares short is to make a profit by buying the shares later at a lower price to cover the sale significant amounts of short selling or the perception that a significant amount of short sales could occur could depress the market price of our common stock in contrast purchases to cover a short position may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock and together with the imposition of the penalty bid may stabilize maintain or otherwise affect the market price of our common stock as a result the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market if these activities are commenced they may be discontinued at any time these transactions may be effected on overthecounter bulletin board or any other available markets or exchanges such short selling if it were to occur could impact the value of our stock in an extreme and volatile manner to the detriment of our shareholders   because we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain future earnings if any to finance the expansion of our business as a result we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including but not limited to our financial condition operating results cash needs growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time accordingly investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize their investment investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock   because we will be subject to the “penny stock” rules the level of trading activity in our stock may be limited   brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges or quoted on nasdaq the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction consequently these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares                we will be required to remain current in our filings with the sec and our securities will not be eligible for quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board if we are not current in our filings with the sec   in the event that our shares are quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board we will be required order to remain current in our filings with the sec in order for shares of our common stock to be eligible for quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board in the event that we become delinquent in our required filings with the sec quotation of our common stock will be terminated following a  day grace period if we do not make our required filing during that time if our shares are not eligible for quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable   item  controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   as required by paragraph b of rules a or d under the securities exchange act of   our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de of the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q based on this evaluation management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q these disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting as described in our annual report on form k for the period ended december     because of the inherent limitations in all control systems our management believes that no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control
