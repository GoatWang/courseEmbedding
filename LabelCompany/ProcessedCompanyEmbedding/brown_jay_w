morio the brown jay psilorhinus morio is a large american jay which has the habitus of a magpie but is slightly smaller and with a shorter tail though the bill is larger it occurs from mexico south into central america on the gulf slope the northernmost extent of the bird is in the rio grande valley of texas contents  description  ecology  range  references  external links descriptionedit subadult in costa rica brown jays vary in plumage geographically there are two main groups northern birds are almost completely dark brown with lighter brown on the underparts southern birds are whitebellied and have bright white tips to the outer tail feathers the intergrade zone is in veracruz mexico adults in both populations have black bills legs and feet immatures have yellow bare parts including yellow eyerings the voice is a loud but lowpitched peeah call and is often modified to suit its situation or mood ecologyedit food is sought largely in trees but brown jays also take some food from the ground they are rather indiscriminate feeders insects and a wide range of other invertebrates are taken also lizards nectar and fruit eg that of trophis racemosa moraceae though they will take eggs and nestlings they appear not to if there is plenty of other food available the nest is built in a tree or large shrub with both sexes helping in construction there are normally three eggs laid but six is not unusual incubation is between  and  days only the female broods but the male feeds her while doing so sometimes the offspring from a previous season will help in raising the chicks if a helper bird returns with food it will give it to one of the resident parents to feed the chicks rangeedit in central america the brown jay is not found in el salvador the range is on the pacific side of central america in nicaragua costa rica and western panama it does not extend into south america referencesedit  birdlife international  psilorhinus morio iucn red list of threatened
