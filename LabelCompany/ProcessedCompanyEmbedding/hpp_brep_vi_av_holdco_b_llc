prospects in the past securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common stock this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock market interest rates may have an effect on the value of our common stock one of the factors that will influence the per share trading price of our common stock will be the dividend yield on our common stock as a percentage of the price of our common stock relative to market interest rates an increase in market interest rates which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution thus higher market interest rates could cause the per share trading price of our common stock to decrease the number of shares of our common stock available for future issuance or sale could adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock we cannot predict whether future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for resale in the open market will decrease the per share trading price of our common stock the issuance of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market or upon exchange of common units or the perception that such issuances might occur could adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock the exchange of common units for common stock the exercise of any options or the vesting of any restricted stock granted to certain directors executive officers and other employees under our equity incentive plan or the issuance of our common stock or common units in connection with future property portfolio or business acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of our common stock in addition the existence of common units options shares of our common stock reserved for issuance as restricted shares of our common stock or upon exchange of common units may adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities future issuances of shares of our common stock may also be dilutive to existing stockholders future offerings of debt securities which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation andor preferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation may adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock in the future we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities or causing our operating partnership to issue debt or equity securities including mediumterm notes senior or subordinated notes and additional classes or series of preferred stock or preferred units upon liquidation holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in our operating partnership and lenders with respect to other borrowings would be entitled to receive our available assets prior to distribution to the holders of our common stock additionally any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the

preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay dividends to the holders of our common stock because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any such future offering thus our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per share trading price of our common stock and diluting their interest in us our ability to pay dividends is limited by the requirements of maryland

table of contents to classify or reclassify unissued shares of the companys preferred stock and thereafter to cause the company to issue such classified or reclassified shares will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs that might arise subject to the rights of holders of series b preferred stock to approve the classification or issuance of shares or increase in the number of authorized shares of a class or series of the companys stock ranking senior to the series b preferred stock the additional classes or

required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the companys securities may be listed or traded although the companys board of directors does not currently intend to do so it could authorize the company to issue a class or series of stock that could depending upon the terms of the particular class or series delay defer or prevent a transaction

where you can find more information incorporation by reference in order for the company to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended or the code the companys stock must be beneficially owned by  or more persons during at least  days of a taxable year of  months other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year also not more than  of the value of the outstanding shares of the companys stock after taking into account certain options to acquire shares of stock may be owned directly indirectly or through attribution by five or fewer individuals for this purpose the term individual includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plan a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes but generally does not include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust at any time during the last half of a taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made the companys charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of the companys common stock series b preferred stock and capital stock that are intended to assist the company in complying with these requirements and continuing to qualify as a reit the relevant sections of the companys charter provide that subject to the exceptions described below no person or entity may actually or beneficially own or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the code more than  in value or in number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock or of the companys series b preferred stock excluding any shares of common stock or series b preferred stock respectively that are not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes or more than  in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of the companys capital stock we refer to each of these restrictions as an ownership limit and collectively as the ownership limits a person or entity that would have acquired actual beneficial or constructive ownership of the companys stock but for the application of the ownership limits or any of the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the companys stock discussed below is referred to as a prohibited owner the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity as a result the acquisition of less than  of the companys common stock or series b preferred stock or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns actually or constructively the companys common stock or series b preferred stock by an individual or entity could nevertheless cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of  in value or in number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the companys outstanding common stock or series b preferred stock as applicable and thereby violate the applicable ownership limit the companys board of directors may in its sole and absolute discretion prospectively or retroactively waive one or more of the ownership limits with respect to a particular person if among other limitations it        determines that such waiver will not cause any individual for this purpose the term individual includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plan a private foundation or a    table of contents   portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes but generally does not include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust to own actually or beneficially more than  in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of the companys capital stock and        determines that subject to certain exceptions such person does not and will not own actually or constructively an interest in a tenant of ours or a tenant of any entity owned in whole or in part by us that would cause the company to own actually or constructively more than a  interest as set forth in section db of the code in such tenant as a condition of such waiver the companys board of directors may require an opinion of counsel or irs ruling satisfactory to the companys board of directors in its sole and absolute discretion in order to determine or ensure the companys status as a reit or such representations andor undertakings as are reasonably necessary to make the determinations above the companys board of directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with such an exception in connection with past offerings of the companys common stock the companys board of directors granted the farallon funds and certain of their affiliates which we refer to collectively as the farallon excepted holders exemptions from the ownership limits subject to various conditions and limitations during the time that such waivers have been or are effective each farallon excepted holder has been and will be subject to an increased ownership limit applicable to such holder or the excepted holder limit as applicable as a condition to granting such excepted holder limits the farallon excepted holders made certain representations and covenants to us including representations that to their best knowledge as a result of their ownership of shares of the companys common stock no other person other than our operating partnership actually beneficially or constructively owns shares of the companys common stock in excess of the ownership limit and that as of certain applicable dates they did not actually or constructively own or reasonably anticipate so owning in excess of  or in certain cases  of the outstanding equity interests in any of the tenants that we have disclosed to the farallon excepted holders in accordance with the terms of such waivers before we enter into or acquire a lease with a new tenant we are obligated to disclose the new tenant to the farallon excepted holders and such holders have one business day to inform us as to whether they actually or constructively own or reasonably anticipate so owning more than  or in certain cases  of the equity interests in such tenant if they do own such an interest if we enter into a lease with that tenant the rent from that tenant could fail to qualify under the reit income tests if this rent could prevent the company from satisfying the reit gross income tests then the companys charter would require that the number of shares owned by the farallon excepted holders in excess of the ownership limit be automatically transferred to a trust as described below if this occurs and the farallon excepted holders gave us advance notice of their tenant ownership as described above we would be obligated to indemnify the farallon excepted holders for any damages they suffer as a result of the transfer of shares to the trust in addition even if the farallon excepted holders do not own one of our tenants they may later acquire over  or in certain cases  of the equity interests in that tenant without causing their exemption to be terminated provided that i the companys annual income from that tenant and other tenants in which they own over a  or in certain cases  interest would not exceed  of the companys gross income and the companys annual income from certain tenants to which the lower  threshold applies would not exceed  of the gross income from one of the companys properties and ii such ownership could not otherwise cause the company to fail to qualify as a reit as a result ownership of our tenants by the farallon excepted holders may increase the companys nonqualifying income or prevent us from entering into certain leases with certain tenants the representations and covenants made by the farallon excepted holders in connection with the granting of the exemptions are intended to ensure that despite granting such exemptions the company will continue to qualify as a reit the farallon excepted holders must inform the company if any of these representations becomes untrue or is violated in which case they will lose their excepted holder limit subject to certain conditions the company may reduce the excepted holder limit but not below the ownership limit if the farallon excepted holders actually beneficially or constructively own fewer shares than the excepted holder limit for a specified period the companys board of directors has granted to our operating partnership an exemption from the ownership limits in addition the companys board of directors has    table of contents granted to certain other holders an exemption from the ownership limits based on certain representations and covenants made to the company by each such holder regarding its ownership and disposition of shares of the companys common stock or shares of the companys series b preferred stock we believe that these exemptions will not jeopardize the companys status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in connection with a waiver of an ownership limit or at any other time the companys board of directors may increase or decrease one or more of the ownership limits except that a decreased ownership limit will not be effective for any person whose actual beneficial or constructive ownership of the companys stock exceeds the decreased ownership limit at the time of the decrease until the persons actual beneficial or constructive ownership of the companys stock equals or falls below the decreased ownership limit although any further acquisition of the companys stock will violate the decreased ownership limit the companys board of directors may not increase or decrease any ownership limit if the new ownership limit would allow five or fewer persons to actually or beneficially own more than  in value of the companys outstanding stock or could cause the company to be closely held under section h of the code without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year or otherwise cause the company to fail to qualify as a reit the companys charter further prohibits        any person from actually beneficially or constructively owning shares of the companys capital stock that could result in the company being closely held under section h of the code without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year or otherwise cause the company to fail to qualify as a reit and        any person from transferring shares of the companys capital stock if such transfer would result in shares of the companys capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than  persons determined without reference to any rules of attribution any person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire actual beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of the companys stock that will or may violate the ownership limits or any of the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the companys stock described above must give written notice immediately to the company or in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction provide the company at least  days prior notice and provide the company with such other information as the company may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on the companys status as a reit the ownership limits and other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the companys stock described above will not apply if the companys board of directors determines that it is no longer in the companys best interest to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit or that compliance with one or more of the restrictions or limitations on ownership and transfer of the companys stock is no longer required in order for the company to qualify as a reit pursuant to the companys charter if any purported transfer of the companys stock or any other event would otherwise result in any person violating the ownership limits or such other limit established by the companys board of directors or could result in the company being closely held within the meaning of section h of the code without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year or otherwise failing to qualify as a reit then the number of shares causing the violation rounded up to the nearest whole share will be automatically transferred to and held by a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable organizations selected by the company the prohibited owner will have no rights in shares of the companys stock held by the trustee the automatic transfer will be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the violative transfer or other event that results in the transfer to the trust any dividend or other distribution paid to the prohibited owner prior to the companys discovery that the shares had been automatically transferred to a trust as described above must be repaid to the trustee upon demand if the transfer to the trust as described above is not automatically effective for any reason to prevent violation of the applicable ownership limit or the company being closely held without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year or otherwise failing to qualify as a reit then the    table of contents transfer of the number of shares that otherwise would cause any person to violate the above restrictions will be void if any transfer of the companys stock would result in shares of the companys stock being beneficially owned by fewer than  persons determined without reference to any rules of attribution then any such purported transfer will be void and of no force or effect and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in the shares shares of the companys stock transferred to the trustee are deemed offered for sale to the company or the companys designee at a price per share equal to the lesser of  the price per share paid by the

on the date the company or the companys designee accepts such offer the company must reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and distributions paid to the prohibited owner and owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee the company will pay the amount of such reduction to the trustee for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary the company has the right to accept such offer until the trustee has sold the shares of the stock of the company held in the trust upon a sale to the company the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold terminates and the trustee must distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited owner and any dividends or other distributions held by the trustee with respect to such stock must be paid to the charitable beneficiary if the company does not buy the shares the trustee must within  days of receiving notice from the company of the transfer of shares to the trust sell the shares to a person or persons designated by the trustee who could own the shares without violating the ownership limits or other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the companys stock upon such sale the trustee

prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions paid to the prohibited owner and owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the prohibited owner will be immediately paid to the charitable beneficiary together with any dividends or other distributions thereon in addition if prior to discovery by the company that shares of its stock have been transferred to the trustee such shares of stock are sold by a prohibited owner then such shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the trust and to the extent that the prohibited owner received an amount for or in respect of such shares that exceeds the amount that such prohibited owner was entitled to receive such excess amount must be paid to the trustee upon demand the trustee will be designated by the company and will be unaffiliated with the company and with any prohibited owner prior to the sale of any shares by the trust the trustee will receive in

the irs or will be sustained by a court if challenged by the irs this summary does not discuss any state local or nonus tax consequences associated with the exercise of redemption rights with respect to the common units the acquisition ownership or disposition of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities or our election to be taxed as a reit you are urged to consult your tax

the operating partnerships debt securities including the federal state local nonus and other tax consequences        our election to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes and        potential changes in applicable tax laws tax consequences of the exercise of redemption rights if you are a holder of common units and you exercise your right to require our operating partnership to redeem all or part of your common units and we elect to acquire some or all of your common units in exchange for our common stock the exchange will be a taxable transaction you generally will recognize gain in an amount equal to the value of the common stock received plus the amount of liabilities of our operating partnership allocable to your common units being acquired less your tax basis in those units the recognition of any loss is subject to a number of limitations set forth in the code the character of any gain or loss as capital or ordinary or any gain as recapture gain

partnership for cash may be similar depending on your circumstances    table of contents taxation of our company general we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections  through  of the code commencing with our taxable year ended december   we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code commencing with our taxable year ended december   and we intend to continue to be organized and operate in this manner however qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the code including through actual annual operating results asset composition distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership accordingly no assurance can be given that we have been organized and have operated or will continue to be organized and operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit see failure to qualify the sections of the code and the corresponding treasury regulations that relate to qualification and taxation as a reit are highly technical and complex the following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the sections of the code that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its stockholders this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions treasury regulations promulgated under the code and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof latham  watkins llp has acted as our tax counsel in connection with this prospectus and our election to be taxed as a reit latham  watkins llp has rendered an opinion to us to the effect that commencing with our taxable year ended december   we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code and our proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code it must be emphasized that this opinion was based on various assumptions and representations as to factual matters including representations made by us in a factual certificate provided by one of our officers in addition this opinion was based upon our factual representations set forth in this prospectus moreover our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the code which are discussed below including through actual annual operating results asset composition distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by latham  watkins llp accordingly no assurance can be given that our actual results of operation for any particular taxable year will satisfy those requirements further the anticipated federal income tax treatment described in this discussion may be changed perhaps retroactively by legislative administrative or judicial action at any time latham  watkins llp has no obligation to update its opinion subsequent to the date of such opinion provided we qualify for taxation as a reit we generally will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on our reit taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that ordinarily results from investment in a c corporation a c corporation is a corporation that generally is required to pay tax at the corporate level double taxation means taxation once at the corporate level when income is earned and once again at the stockholder level when the income is distributed we will however be required to pay federal income tax as follows        first we will be required to pay tax at regular corporate rates on any undistributed reit taxable income including undistributed net capital gains        second we may be required to pay the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference under some circumstances        third if we have  net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or  other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property we will be required to pay tax at the highest corporate rate on this income to the extent that income from foreclosure property is otherwise qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test this tax is not applicable subject to certain other requirements foreclosure property generally is defined as property we acquired through foreclosure or after a default on a loan secured by the property or a lease of the property    table of contents      fourth we will be required to pay a  tax on any net income from prohibited transactions prohibited transactions are in general sales or other taxable dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business        fifth if we fail to satisfy the  gross income test or the  gross income test as described below but have otherwise maintained our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met we will be required to pay a tax equal to  the greater of a the amount by which we fail to satisfy the  gross income test and b the amount by which we fail to satisfy the  gross income test multiplied by  a fraction intended to reflect our profitability        sixth if we fail to satisfy any of the asset tests other than a de minimis failure of the  or  asset test as described below due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of  or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets that caused us to fail such test        seventh if we fail to satisfy any provision of the code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the gross income tests or certain violations of the asset tests as described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of  for each such failure        eighth we will be required to pay a  excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of   of our ordinary income for the year   of our capital gain net income for the year and  any undistributed taxable income from prior periods        ninth if we acquire any asset from a corporation that is or has been a c corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is less than the fair market value of the asset in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset and we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset then we will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on this gain to the extent of the excess of  the fair market value of the asset over  our adjusted basis in the asset in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of gain assume that the c corporation will refrain from making an election to receive different treatment under applicable treasury regulations on its tax return for the year in which we acquire the asset from the c corporation the irs has issued treasury regulations that generally exclude from the application of this builtin gains tax any gain from the sale of property acquired in an exchange under section  a likekind exchange or section  an involuntary conversion of the code        tenth our subsidiaries that are c corporations including our taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be required to pay federal corporate income tax on their earnings        eleventh we will be required to pay a  tax on any redetermined rents redetermined deductions or excess interest see penalty tax in general redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of services furnished to any of our tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary of ours redetermined deductions and excess interest generally represent amounts that are deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arms length negotiations        twelfth we may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain in that case a stockholder would include its proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain to the extent we make a timely designation of such gain to the stockholder in its income would be deemed to have paid the tax that we paid on such gain and would be allowed a credit for its proportionate share of the tax deemed to have been paid and an adjustment would be made to increase the basis of the stockholder in our capital stock    table of contents requirements for qualification as a reit  the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association      that is managed by one or more trustees or directors      that issues transferable shares or transferable certificates to evidence its beneficial ownership      that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for sections  through  of the code      that is not a financial institution or an insurance company within the meaning of certain provisions of the code      that is beneficially owned by  or more persons      not more than  in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals including certain specified entities during the last half of each taxable year and      that meets other tests described below regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions the code provides that conditions  to  inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition  must be met during at least  days of a taxable year of  months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than  months conditions  and  do not apply until after the first taxable year for which an election is made to be taxed as a reit for purposes of condition  the term individual includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plan a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes but generally does not include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us and will continue to allow us to satisfy conditions  through  inclusive during the relevant time periods in addition our charter provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of our shares that are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in  and  above a description of the share ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our outstanding capital stock is contained in the discussion in this prospectus under the heading restrictions on ownership and transfer these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in conditions  and  above if we fail to satisfy these share ownership requirements except as provided in the next sentence our status as a reit will terminate if however we comply with the rules contained in applicable treasury regulations that require us to ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that we failed to meet the requirement described in condition  above we will be treated as having met this requirement see failure to qualify in addition we may not maintain our status as a reit unless our taxable year is the calendar year we have and will continue to have a calendar taxable year ownership of interests in partnerships limited liability companies and qualified reit subsidiaries  in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member in a limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes treasury regulations provide that the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company as the case may be based on its interest in partnership capital subject to special rules relating to the  asset test described below also the reit will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of the income of that entity the assets and gross income of the partnership or limited liability company retain the same character in the hands of the reit for purposes of section  of the code including satisfying the gross income tests and the asset tests thus our pro rata share of the assets and items of income of our operating partnership including our operating partnerships share of these items of any partnership or limited liability company treated as a partnership or disregarded entity    table of contents for federal income tax purposes in which it owns an interest is treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the requirements described in this discussion including the gross income and asset tests described below a brief summary of the rules governing the federal income taxation of partnerships and limited liability companies is set forth below in tax aspects of our operating partnership the subsidiary partnerships and the limited liability companies we have control of our operating partnership and the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies and intend to operate them in a manner consistent with the requirements for our qualification as a reit if we become a limited partner or nonmanaging member in any partnership or limited liability company and such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a reit or require us to pay tax we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity in addition it is possible that a partnership or limited liability company could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or asset test and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take other corrective action on a timely basis in that case we could fail to qualify as a reit unless we were entitled to relief as described below we may from time to time own and operate certain properties through subsidiaries that we intend to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries under the code a corporation will qualify as our qualified reit subsidiary if we own  of the corporations outstanding stock and do not elect with the subsidiary to treat it as a taxable reit subsidiary as described below a qualified reit subsidiary is not treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income gain loss deduction and credit of a qualified reit subsidiary are treated as assets liabilities and items of income gain loss deduction and credit of the parent reit for all purposes under the code including all reit qualification tests thus in applying the federal tax requirements described in this discussion any qualified reit subsidiaries we own are ignored and all assets liabilities and items of income gain loss deduction and credit of such corporations are treated as our assets liabilities and items of income gain loss deduction and credit a qualified reit subsidiary is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions on ownership of securities as described below under asset tests ownership of interests in taxable reit subsidiaries  we currently own an interest in one taxable reit subsidiary and may acquire securities in additional taxable reit subsidiaries in the future a taxable reit subsidiary is a corporation other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock and that has made a joint election with such reit to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary if a taxable reit subsidiary owns more than  of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation such other corporation will also be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities a taxable reit subsidiary may generally engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular c corporation in addition a taxable reit subsidiary may be prevented from deducting interest on debt funded directly or indirectly by its parent reit if certain tests regarding the taxable reit subsidiarys debt to equity ratio and interest expense are not satisfied a reits ownership of securities of a taxable reit subsidiary is not subject to the  or  asset test described below see asset tests ownership of interests in subsidiary reits  we own and may acquire direct or indirect interests in one or more entities that have elected or will elect to be taxed as reits under the code each a subsidiary reit a subsidiary reit is subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us if a subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit then i that subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax ii shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be qualifying assets for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and iii it is possible that we would fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we would fail to qualify as a reit unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions    table of contents income tests we must satisfy two gross income requirements annually to maintain our qualification as a reit first in each taxable year we must derive directly or indirectly at least  of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions certain hedging transactions and certain foreign currency gains from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property dividends from other reits and in certain circumstances interest or certain types of temporary investments second in each taxable year we must derive at least  of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions certain hedging transactions and certain foreign currency gains from the real property investments described above or dividends interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities or any combination of the foregoing for these purposes the term interest generally does not include any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly if the determination of all or some of the amount depends in any way on the income or profits of any person however an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales rents we receive from a tenant will qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if all of the following conditions are met        the amount of rent is not based in any way on the income or profits of any person however an amount we receive or accrue generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely because it is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales        neither we nor an actual or constructive owner of  or more of our capital stock actually or constructively owns  or more of the interests in the assets or net profits of a noncorporate tenant or if the tenant is a corporation  or more of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the tenant rents we receive from such a tenant that is a taxable reit subsidiary of ours however will not be excluded from the definition of rents from real property as a result of this condition if at least  of the space at the property to which the rents relate is leased to third parties and the rents paid by the taxable reit subsidiary are substantially comparable to rents paid by our other tenants for comparable space whether rents paid by a taxable reit subsidiary are substantially comparable to rents paid by other tenants is determined at the time the lease with the taxable reit subsidiary is entered into extended and modified if such modification increases the rents due under such lease notwithstanding the foregoing however if a lease with a controlled taxable reit subsidiary is modified and such modification results in an increase in the rents payable by such taxable reit subsidiary any such increase will not qualify as rents from real property for purposes of this rule a controlled taxable reit subsidiary is a taxable reit subsidiary in which the parent reit owns stock possessing more than  of the voting power or more than  of the total value of the outstanding stock of such taxable reit subsidiary we currently lease space to wholly owned subsidiaries of our taxable reit subsidiary at our media and entertainment properties and may from time to time enter into additional leases with one or more taxable reit subsidiaries to the extent any rent from such lease does not satisfy the  rental exception described above our receipt of such rent will not qualify under the gross income tests        rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is not greater than  of the total rent received under the lease if this condition is not met then the portion of the rent attributable to personal property will not qualify as rents from real property to the extent that rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property exceeds  of the total rent received under the lease we may transfer a portion of such personal property to a taxable reit subsidiary our taxable reit subsidiary indirectly owns certain personal property leased to tenants at our media and entertainment properties and from time to time one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries may own personal property leased to tenants at other properties and        we generally do not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to our tenants subject to a  de minimis exception and except as provided below we may however perform services that are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are    table of contents   not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property examples of these services include the provision of light heat or other utilities trash removal and general maintenance of common areas in addition we may employ an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue to provide customary services or a taxable reit subsidiary which may be wholly or partially owned by us to provide both customary and noncustomary services to our tenants without causing the rent we receive from those tenants to fail to qualify as rents from real property certain wholly owned subsidiaries of our taxable reit subsidiary which is our services company provide noncustomary services to certain of our tenants at our media and entertainment properties and from time to time one or more taxable reit subsidiaries may provide noncustomary services to our tenants at these and other properties any amounts we receive from a taxable reit subsidiary with respect to the taxable reit subsidiarys provision of noncustomary services will however be nonqualifying income under the  gross income test and except to the extent received through the payment of dividends the  gross income test we generally do not intend and as a general partner of our operating partnership do not intend to permit our operating partnership to take actions we believe will cause us to fail to satisfy the rental conditions described above however we may intentionally fail to satisfy some of these conditions to the extent we determine based on the advice of our tax counsel that the failure will not jeopardize our tax status as a reit in addition with respect to the limitation on the rental of personal property we have not obtained appraisals of the real property and personal property leased to tenants accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not disagree with our determinations of value moreover in connection with granting excepted holder limits to certain excepted holders we have obtained and in the future may obtain representations from these entities in order to ensure that we generally will not be deemed to own an interest in any of our tenants or in the event we are treated as owning such an interest as a result of granting such waiver we will not derive nonqualifying rental income in excess of certain thresholds some of our leases are in the form of licenses and have terms of less than  days shortterm licenses the treatment of rents derived with respect to these shortterm licenses for purposes of the gross income tests is not entirely clear we believe that rents derived with respect to these shortterm licenses should qualify as rents from real property for purposes of the gross income tests although there can be no assurance that the irs will not take a contrary position if the payments we receive in connection with such shortterm licenses do not qualify as rents from real property such payments would not be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests income we receive that is attributable to the rental of parking spaces at the properties generally will constitute rents from real property for purposes of the gross income tests if certain services provided with respect to the parking spaces are performed by independent contractors from whom we derive no revenue either directly or indirectly or by a taxable reit subsidiary and certain other conditions are met we believe that the income we receive that is attributable to parking spaces meets these tests and accordingly will constitute rents from real property for purposes of the gross income tests from time to time we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps caps and floors options to purchase these items and futures and forward contracts income from a hedging transaction including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction that is clearly identified as a hedging transaction as specified in the code will not constitute gross income and thus will be exempt from the  and  gross income tests the term hedging transaction as used above generally means any transaction we enter into in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of  interest rate changes or fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets or  currency fluctuations with respect to an item of qualifying income under the  or  gross income test to the extent that we do not properly identify such transactions as hedges or we hedge with other types of financial instruments the income from those transactions is not likely to be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests we intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a reit    table of contents to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries pay dividends we generally will derive our allocable share of such dividend income through our interest in our operating partnership such dividend income will qualify under the  but not the  gross income test we will monitor the amount of the dividend and other income from our taxable reit subsidiaries and will take actions intended to keep this income and any other nonqualifying income within the limitations of the gross income tests although we expect these actions will be sufficient to prevent a violation of the gross income tests we cannot guarantee that such actions will in all cases prevent such a violation if we fail to satisfy one or both of the  or  gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code we generally may make use of the relief provisions if        following our identification of the failure to meet the  or  gross income tests for any taxable year we file a schedule with the irs setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the  or  gross income tests for such taxable year in accordance with treasury regulations to be issued and        our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect it is not possible however to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions for example if we fail to satisfy the gross income tests because nonqualifying income that we intentionally accrue or receive exceeds the limits on nonqualifying income the irs could conclude that our failure to satisfy the tests was not due to reasonable cause if these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances we will not qualify as a reit as discussed above in taxation of our companygeneral even if these relief provisions apply and we retain our status as a reit a tax would be imposed with respect to our nonqualifying income we may not always be able to comply with the gross income tests for reit qualification despite periodic monitoring of our income prohibited transaction income  any gain that we realize on the sale of property held as inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business including our share of any such gain realized by our operating partnership either directly or through its subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a  penalty tax unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply this prohibited transaction income may also adversely affect our ability to satisfy the gross income tests for qualification as a reit under existing law whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction our operating partnership intends to hold its properties for investment with a view to longterm appreciation to engage in the business of acquiring developing and owning its properties and to make occasional sales of the properties as are consistent with our operating partnerships investment objectives we do not intend to enter into any sales that are prohibited transactions however the irs may successfully contend that some or all of the sales made by our operating partnership or its subsidiary partnerships or limited liability companies are prohibited transactions we would be required to pay the  penalty tax on our allocable share of the gains resulting from any such sales penalty tax  any redetermined rents redetermined deductions or excess interest we generate will be subject to a  penalty tax in general redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of any services furnished to any of our tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary of ours and redetermined deductions and excess interest represent any amounts that are deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arms length negotiations rents we receive will not constitute redetermined rents if they qualify for certain safe harbor provisions contained in the code currently certain wholly owned subsidiaries of our taxable reit subsidiary which is our services company provide services to certain of our tenants and pay rent to us and from time to time we may enter into    table of contents additional leases with our taxable reit subsidiaries that also provide services to our tenants we believe we have set and we intend to set in the future any fees paid to our taxable reit subsidiaries for such services and any rent payable to us by our taxable reit subsidiaries at arms length rates although the amounts paid may not satisfy the safeharbor provisions described above these determinations are inherently factual and the irs has broad discretion to assert that amounts paid between related parties should be reallocated to clearly reflect their respective incomes if the irs successfully made such an assertion we would be required to pay a  penalty tax on the excess of an arms length fee for tenant services over the amount actually paid or on the excess rents paid to us asset tests at the close of each calendar quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy certain tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets first at least  of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items and us government securities for purposes of this test the term real estate assets generally means real property including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property and shares or transferable certificates of beneficial interest in other reits as well as any stock or debt instrument attributable to the investment of the proceeds of a stock offering or a public offering of debt with a term of at least five years but only for the oneyear period beginning on the date the reit receives such proceeds second not more than  of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities including securities of taxable reit subsidiaries other than those securities includable in the  asset test third of the investments included in the  asset class and except for investments in other reits our qualified reit subsidiaries and taxable reit subsidiaries the value of any one issuers securities may not exceed  of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than  of the total vote or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer except in the case of the  value test securities satisfying the straight debt safeharbor or securities issued by a partnership that itself would satisfy the  income test if it were a reit certain types of securities we may own are disregarded as securities solely for purposes of the  value test including but not limited to any loan to an individual or an estate any obligation to pay rents from real property and any security issued by a reit in addition solely for purposes of the  value test the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership or limited liability company excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the code from time to time we may own securities including debt securities of issuers that do not qualify as a reit a qualified reit subsidiary or a taxable reit subsidiary we intend that our ownership of any such securities will be structured in a manner that allows us to comply with the asset tests described above our operating partnership currently owns  of the securities of a corporation that has elected together with us to be treated as our taxable reit subsidiary so long as this corporation qualifies as our taxable reit subsidiary we will not be subject to the  asset test the  voting securities limitation or the  value limitation with respect to our ownership of its securities we may acquire securities in other taxable reit subsidiaries in the future we believe that the aggregate value of our taxable reit subsidiary and our other securities other than those securities which are qualifying assets for purposes of the  asset test has not exceeded and in the future will not exceed  of the aggregate value of our gross assets no independent appraisals have been obtained to support these conclusions in addition there can be no assurance that the irs will not disagree with our determinations of value the asset tests must be satisfied at the close of each calendar quarter of our taxable year in which we directly or through our operating partnership acquire securities in the applicable issuer and also at the close of each calendar quarter in which we increase our ownership of securities of such issuer including as a result of    table of contents increasing our interest in our operating partnership for example our indirect ownership of securities of each issuer will increase as a result of our capital contributions to our operating partnership or as limited partners exercise their redemptionexchange rights accordingly after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values if we fail to satisfy an asset test because we acquire securities or other property during a quarter including as a result of an increase in our interest in our operating partnership we may cure this failure by disposing of sufficient nonqualifying assets within  days after the close of that quarter we believe that we have maintained and we intend to maintain adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests if we fail to cure any noncompliance with the asset tests within the day cure period we would cease to qualify as a reit unless we are eligible for certain relief provisions discussed below certain relief provisions may be available to us if we discover a failure to satisfy the asset tests described above after the day cure period under these provisions we will be deemed to have met the  and  asset tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets i does not exceed the lesser of a  of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or b  and ii we dispose of the nonqualifying assets or otherwise satisfy such tests within a six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or b the period of time prescribed by treasury regulations to be issued for violations of any of the asset tests due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and that are in the case of the  and  asset tests in excess of the de minimis exception described above we may avoid disqualification as a reit after the day cure period by taking steps including i the disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets or the taking of other actions which allow us to meet the asset tests within a six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or b the period of time prescribed by treasury regulations to be issued ii paying a tax equal to the greater of a  or b the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and iii disclosing certain information to the irs although we believe we have satisfied the asset tests described above and plan to take steps to ensure that we satisfy such tests for any quarter with respect to which retesting is to occur there can be no assurance that we will always be successful or will not require a reduction in our operating partnerships overall interest in an issuer including in a taxable reit subsidiary if we fail to cure any noncompliance with the asset tests in a timely manner and the relief provisions described above are not available we would cease to qualify as a reit annual distribution requirements to maintain our qualification as a reit we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to the sum of         of our reit taxable income and         of our aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus        the excess of the sum of certain items of noncash income over  of our reit taxable income for these purposes our reit taxable income is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain in addition for purposes of this test noncash income means income attributable to leveled stepped rents original issue discount on purchase money debt cancellation of indebtedness or a likekind exchange that is later determined to be taxable in addition our reit taxable income will be reduced by any taxes we are required to pay on any gain we recognize from the disposition of any asset we acquired from a corporation that is or has been a c corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is less than the fair market value of the asset in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset within the tenyear period following our acquisition of such asset    table of contents we generally must pay or be treated as paying the distributions described above in the taxable year to which they relate at our election a distribution will be treated as paid in a taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration provided such payment is made during the month period following the close of such year these distributions are treated as received by our stockholders in the year in which paid this is so even though these distributions relate to the prior year for purposes of the  distribution requirement in order to be taken into account for purposes of our distribution requirement the amount distributed must not be preferential ie  every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated other than according to its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least  but less than  of our reit taxable income as adjusted we will be required to pay tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates we believe that we have made and we intend to continue to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements and to minimize our corporate tax obligations in this regard the partnership agreement of our operating partnership authorizes us as general partner of our operating partnership to take such steps as may be necessary to cause our operating partnership to distribute to its partners an amount sufficient to permit us to meet these distribution requirements and to minimize our corporate tax obligation we expect that our reit taxable income will be less than our cash flow because of depreciation and other noncash charges included in computing reit taxable income accordingly we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirements described above however from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet these distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in determining our taxable income in addition we may decide to retain our cash rather than distribute it in order to repay debt or for other reasons if these timing differences occur we may borrow funds to pay dividends or pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirements while preserving our cash under some circumstances we may be able to rectify an inadvertent failure to meet the  distribution requirement for a year by paying deficiency dividends to our stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends subject to the  excise tax described below however we will be required to pay interest to the irs based upon the amount of any deduction claimed for deficiency dividends furthermore we will be required to pay a  excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of  of our ordinary income for such year  of our capital gain net income for the year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods any ordinary income and net capital gain on which this excise tax is imposed for any year is treated as an amount distributed during that year for purposes of calculating such tax for purposes of the  distribution requirement and excise tax described above dividends declared during the last three months of the taxable year payable to stockholders of record on a specified date during such period and paid during january of the following year will be treated as paid by us and received by our stockholders on december  of the year in which they are declared likekind exchanges we may dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as likekind exchanges under the code such likekind exchanges are intended to result in the deferral of gain for federal income tax purposes the failure of any such transaction to qualify as a likekind exchange could require us to pay federal income tax possibly including the  prohibited transaction tax depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction    table of contents failure to qualify if we discover a violation of a provision of the code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit certain specified cure provisions may be available to us except with respect to violations of the gross income tests and asset tests for which the cure provisions are described above and provided the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect these cure provisions generally impose a  penalty for each violation in lieu of a loss of reit status if we fail to satisfy the requirements for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions do not apply we will be required to pay tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible by us and we will not be required to distribute any amounts to our stockholders as a result we anticipate that our failure to qualify as a reit would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits in such event corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction in addition noncorporate stockholders including individuals may be eligible for the preferential tax rates on qualified dividend income unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we would also be ineligible to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose our qualification it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief tax aspects of our operating partnership the subsidiary partnerships and the limited liability companies general all of our investments are held indirectly through our operating partnership in addition our operating partnership holds certain of its investments indirectly through subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies which we believe have been and will continue to be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes in general entities that are treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes are passthrough entities which are not required to pay federal income tax rather partners or members of such entities are allocated their shares of the items of income gain loss deduction and credit of the partnership or limited liability company and are potentially required to pay tax on this income without regard to whether they receive a distribution from the partnership or limited liability company we will include in our income our share of these partnership and limited liability company items for purposes of the various gross income tests the computation of our reit taxable income and the reit distribution requirements moreover for purposes of the asset tests we will include our pro rata share of assets held by our operating partnership including its share of its subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies based on our capital interests in each such entity see taxation of our company entity classification our interests in our operating partnership and the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies involve special tax considerations including the possibility that the irs might challenge the status of these entities as partnerships or disregarded entities for example an entity that would otherwise be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a publicly traded partnership and certain other requirements are met a partnership or limited liability company would be treated as a publicly traded partnership if its interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or a substantial equivalent thereof within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations we do not anticipate that our operating partnership or any subsidiary partnership or limited liability company will be treated as a publicly traded partnership that is taxable as a corporation however if any such entity were treated as a corporation it would be required to pay an entitylevel tax on its income in this situation the character of our assets and items of gross income would change and could prevent us from satisfying the reit asset tests and possibly the reit income tests see taxation of our companyasset tests and income tests this in turn could prevent us from qualifying as a reit see failure to qualify for a discussion of the effect of our failure to meet these tests in addition a change in the tax status of our operating partnership or a subsidiary partnership or limited liability company might be treated as a taxable event if so we might incur a tax liability without any related cash payment we believe our operating partnership and each of our other partnerships and limited liability companies have been and will continue to be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes    table of contents allocations of income gain loss and deduction  the operating partnership agreement generally provides that allocations of net income will be made first to holders of series a preferred units to the extent of the accrued preferred return on such units and then to us to the extent of the accrued preferred return on our series b preferred units to the extent we issue a new class of preferred stock we expect to contribute the net proceeds from such issuance to the operating partnership in exchange for a new class of preferred units which will be entitled to allocations of net income in accordance with their terms any remaining net income will be allocated to holders of common units allocations to holders of common units will generally be made proportionately to all such holders in respect of such units certain limited partners have guaranteed debt of our operating partnership indirectly through an agreement to make capital contributions to our operating partnership under limited circumstances as a result of these guaranties or contribution agreements and notwithstanding the foregoing discussion of allocations of income and loss of our operating partnership to holders of units such limited partners could under limited circumstances be allocated a disproportionate amount of net loss upon a liquidation of our operating partnership which net loss would have otherwise been allocable to us if an allocation of partnership income or loss does not comply with the requirements of section b of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners interests in the partnership this reallocation will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item our operating partnerships allocations of taxable income and loss are intended to comply with the requirements of section b of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder tax allocations with respect to the properties  under section c of the code income gain loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated in a manner so that the contributing partner is charged with the unrealized gain or benefits from the unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution the amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss generally is equal to the difference between the fair market value or book value and the adjusted tax basis of the contributed property at the time of contribution as adjusted from time to time these allocations are solely for federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners our operating partnership may from time to time acquire interests in property in exchange for interests in our operating partnership in that case the tax basis of these property interests generally carries over to the operating partnership notwithstanding their different book  ie  fair market value this difference is referred to as a booktax difference the partnership agreement requires that income and loss allocations with respect to these properties be made in a manner consistent with section c of the code treasury regulations issued under section c of the code provide partnerships with a choice of several methods of accounting for booktax differences depending on the method we choose in connection with any particular contribution the carryover basis of each of the contributed interests in the properties in the hands of our operating partnership i will or could cause us to be allocated lower amounts of depreciation deductions for tax purposes than would be allocated to us if any of the contributed properties were to have a tax basis equal to its respective fair market value at the time of the contribution and ii could cause us to be allocated taxable gain in the event of a sale of such contributed interests or properties in excess of the economic or book income allocated to us as a result of such sale with a corresponding benefit to the other partners in our operating partnership an allocation described in clause ii above might cause us or the other partners to recognize taxable income in excess of cash proceeds in the event of a sale or other disposition of property which might adversely affect our ability to comply with the reit distribution requirements see generalrequirements for qualification as a reit and annual distribution requirements any property acquired by our operating partnership in a taxable transaction will initially have a tax basis equal to its fair market value and section c of the code generally will not apply    table of contents federal income tax considerations for holders of our capital stock and the operating partnerships debt securities the following summary describes the principal federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring owning and disposing of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities this summary assumes you hold shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities as capital assets generally property held for investment within the meaning of section  of the code in addition in the case of the operating partnerships debt securities it is limited to persons purchasing such securities for cash at original issue and at their original issue price within the meaning of section  of the code  ie  the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt securities is sold to the public for cash this summary does not address all the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances in addition this discussion does not address the tax consequences relevant to persons who receive special treatment under the federal income tax law except where specifically noted holders receiving

whose functional currency is not the us dollar if you are considering acquiring our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities you should consult your tax advisor concerning the application of federal income tax laws to your particular situation as well as any consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities arising under the laws of any state local or nonus taxing jurisdiction when we use the term us holder we mean a holder of shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities who for federal income tax purposes is        an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states        a corporation including an entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof or in the district of columbia        an estate the income of which is subject to federal income taxation regardless of its source or        a trust that  is subject to the primary supervision of a us court and the control of one or more us persons or  has a valid election in effect under applicable treasury regulations to be treated as a us person    table of contents if you are an individual corporation estate or trust that holds shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities and you are not a us holder you are a nonus holder for purposes of this discussion a us stockholder is a us holder of our capital stock and a nonus stockholder is a nonus holder of our capital stock if a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes holds shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and on the activities of the partnership partners of partnerships holding shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors taxation of taxable us stockholders distributions generally  distributions out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as dividends and other than with respect to capital gain dividends and certain amounts which have previously been subject to corporate level tax discussed below will be taxable to our taxable us stockholders as ordinary income when actually or constructively received see tax rates below as long as we qualify as a reit these distributions will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction in the case of us stockholders that are corporations or except to the extent provided in tax rates below the preferential rates on qualified dividend income applicable to noncorporate us stockholders including individuals for purposes of determining whether distributions to holders of our capital stock are out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits our earnings and profits will be allocated first to our outstanding preferred stock and then to our outstanding common stock to the extent that we make distributions on our capital stock in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such stock these distributions will be treated first as a taxfree return of capital to a us stockholder this treatment will reduce the us stockholders adjusted tax basis in such shares of stock by the amount of the distribution but not below zero distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a us stockholders adjusted tax basis in its shares will be taxable as capital gain such gain will be taxable as longterm capital gain if the shares have been held for more than one year dividends we declare in october november or december of any year and which are payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any of these months will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on december  of that year provided we actually pay the dividend on or before january  of the following year us stockholders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses us stockholders that receive taxable stock dividends including dividends partially payable in our capital stock and partially payable in cash would be required to include the full amount of the dividend ie the cash and the stock portion as ordinary income subject to limited exceptions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes as described above the amount of any dividend payable in our capital stock generally is equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of the capital stock depending on the circumstances of a us stockholder the tax on the distribution may exceed the amount of the distribution received in cash in which case such us stockholder would have to pay the tax using cash from other sources if a us stockholder sells the capital stock it received in connection with a taxable stock dividend in order to pay this tax and the proceeds of such sale are less than the amount required to be included in income with respect to the stock portion of the dividend such us stockholder could have a capital loss with respect to the stock sale that could not be used to offset such dividend income a us stockholder that receives capital stock pursuant to a distribution generally has a tax basis in such capital stock equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of such capital stock as described above and has a holding period in such capital stock that begins on the day immediately following the payment date for the distribution    table of contents capital gain dividends  dividends that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to our taxable us stockholders as a gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset held for more than one year to the extent that such gain does not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year us stockholders that are corporations may however be required to treat up to  of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income if we properly designate any portion of a dividend as a capital gain dividend then except as otherwise required by law we presently intend to allocate a portion of the total capital gain dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of our capital stock for the year to the holders of each class of our capital stock in proportion to the amount that our total dividends as determined for us federal income tax purposes paid or made available to the holders of each such class of our capital stock for the year bears to the total dividends as determined for us federal income tax purposes paid or made available to holders of all classes of our capital stock for the year retention of net capital gains  we may elect to retain rather than distribute as a capital gain dividend all or a portion of our net capital gains if we make this election we would pay tax on our retained net capital gains in addition to the extent we so elect our earnings and profits determined for federal income tax purposes would be adjusted accordingly and a us stockholder generally would        include its pro rata share of our undistributed net capital gains in computing its longterm capital gains in its return for its taxable year in which the last day of our taxable year falls subject to certain limitations as to the amount that is includable        be deemed to have paid its share of the capital gains tax imposed on us on the designated amounts included in the us stockholders income as longterm capital gain        receive a credit or refund for the amount of tax deemed paid by it        increase the adjusted basis of its capital stock by the difference between the amount of includable gains and the tax deemed to have been paid by it and        in the case of a us stockholder that is a corporation appropriately adjust its earnings and profits for the retained capital gains in accordance with treasury regulations to be promulgated by the irs passive activity losses and investment interest limitations  distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a us stockholder of our shares will not be treated as passive activity income as a result us stockholders generally will not be able to apply any passive losses against this income or gain a us stockholder may elect to treat capital gain dividends capital gains from the disposition of our stock and income designated as qualified dividend income described in tax rates below as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation but in such case the stockholder will be taxed at ordinary income rates on such amount other distributions made by us to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation dispositions of our capital stock  except as described below under redemption or repurchase by us if a us stockholder sells or disposes of shares of capital stock it will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received on the sale or other disposition and the holders adjusted basis in the shares this gain or loss except as provided below will be a longterm capital gain or loss if the holder has held such capital stock for more than one year however if a us stockholder recognizes a loss upon the sale or other disposition of capital stock that it has held for six months or less after applying certain holding period rules the loss recognized will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent the us stockholder received distributions from us which were required to be treated as longterm capital gains redemption or repurchase by us  a redemption or repurchase of shares of our capital stock will be treated under section  of the code as a distribution and taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as described above under distributions generally unless the redemption    table of contents or repurchase satisfies one of the tests set forth in section b of the code and is therefore treated as a sale or exchange of the redeemed or repurchased shares the redemption or repurchase generally will be treated as a sale or exchange if it        is substantially disproportionate with respect to the us stockholder        results in a complete termination of the us stockholders stock interest in us or        is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the us stockholder all within the meaning of section b of the code in determining whether any of these tests have been met shares of capital stock including common stock and other equity interests in us considered to be owned by the us stockholder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the code as well as shares of our capital stock actually owned by the us stockholder must generally be taken into account because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of section b of the code will be satisfied with respect to the us stockholder depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time that the determination must be made us stockholders are advised to consult their tax advisors to determine such tax treatment if a redemption or repurchase of shares of our capital stock is treated as a distribution the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received see distributions generally above a us stockholders adjusted tax basis in the redeemed or repurchased shares generally will be transferred to the us shareholders remaining shares of our capital stock if any if the us stockholder owns no other shares of our capital stock under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely proposed treasury regulations issued in  if enacted in their current form would affect the basis recovery rules described above it is not clear whether these proposed regulations will be enacted in their current form or at all prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the federal income tax consequences of a redemption or repurchase of our capital stock if a redemption or repurchase of shares of our capital stock is not treated as a distribution it will be treated as a taxable sale or exchange in the manner described under dispositions of our capital stock tax rates  the maximum tax rate for noncorporate taxpayers for  longterm capital gains including certain capital gain dividends is generally  although depending on the characteristics of the assets which produced these gains and on designations which we may make certain capital gain dividends may be taxed at a  rate and  qualified dividend income is generally  in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income except to the extent that certain holding period requirements have been met and the reits dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as its taxable reit subsidiaries or to income that was subject to tax at the corporatereit level for example if the reit distributed taxable income that it retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year in addition us stockholders that are corporations may be required to treat up to  of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income foreign accounts certain payments made to foreign financial institutions in respect of accounts of us stockholders at such financial institutions may be subject to withholding at a rate of  us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect if any of these withholding rules on their ownership and disposition of our capital stock see additional withholding tax on payments made to foreign accounts    table of contents taxation of taxexempt stockholders dividend income from us and gain arising upon a sale of our shares generally should not be unrelated business taxable income or ubti to a taxexempt stockholder except as described below this income or gain generally will be ubti however if a taxexempt stockholder holds its shares as debtfinanced property within the meaning of the code generally debtfinanced property is property the acquisition or holding of which was financed through a borrowing by the taxexempt stockholder for taxexempt stockholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts or qualified group legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under sections c c c or c of the code respectively income from an investment in our shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for amounts set aside or placed in reserve for specific purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our shares these prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements notwithstanding the above however a portion of the dividends paid by a pensionheld reit may be treated as unrelated business taxable income as to certain trusts that hold more than  by value of the interests in the reit a reit will not be a pensionheld reit if it is able to satisfy the not closely held requirement without relying on the lookthrough exception with respect to certain trusts or if such reit is not predominantly held by qualified trusts as a result of restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock contained in our charter we do not expect to be classified as a pensionheld reit and as a result the tax treatment described above should be inapplicable to our stockholders however because our common stock and our series b preferred stock are and we anticipate will continue to be publicly traded we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case taxation of nonus stockholders the following discussion addresses the rules governing federal income taxation of the acquisition ownership and disposition of our capital stock by nonus stockholders these rules are complex and no attempt is made herein to provide more than a brief summary of such rules accordingly the discussion does not address all aspects of federal income taxation and does not address state local or nonus tax consequences that may be relevant to a nonus stockholder in light of its particular circumstances we urge nonus stockholders to consult their tax advisors to determine the impact of federal state local and nonus income tax laws on the acquisition ownership and disposition of shares of our capital stock including any reporting requirements distributions generally  distributions including any taxable stock dividends that are neither attributable to gains from sales or exchanges by us of us real property interests or usrpis nor designated by us as capital gain dividends except as described below will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits such distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of federal income tax at a  rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty unless the distributions are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the nonus stockholder of a us trade or business under certain treaties however lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from a reit certain certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied to be exempt from withholding under the effectively connected income exemption dividends that are treated as effectively connected with a us trade or business will generally not be subject to withholding but will be subject to federal income tax on a net basis at graduated rates in the same manner as dividends paid to us stockholders are subject to federal income tax any such dividends received by a nonus stockholder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a  rate applicable after deducting federal income taxes paid on such effectively connected income or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty    table of contents except as otherwise provided below we expect to withhold federal income tax at the rate of  on any distributions made to a nonus stockholder unless    a lower treaty rate applies and the nonus stockholder files with us an irs form wben or wbene or applicable successor form evidencing eligibility for that reduced treaty rate or    the nonus stockholder files an irs form weci or applicable successor form with us claiming that the distribution is income effectively connected with the nonus stockholders trade or business distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a nonus stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholders capital stock but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such stock to the extent that such distributions exceed the nonus stockholders adjusted basis in such capital stock they will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of such stock the tax treatment of which is described below for withholding purposes we expect to treat all distributions as made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits however amounts withheld may be refundable if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided that certain conditions are met capital gain dividends and distributions attributable to a sale or exchange of us real property interests  distributions to a nonus stockholder that we properly designate as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a usrpi generally should not be subject to federal income taxation unless    the investment in our capital stock is treated as effectively connected with the nonus stockholders us trade or business in which case the nonus stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as us stockholders with respect to such gain except that a nonus stockholder that is a nonus corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax of up to  as discussed above or    the nonus stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for  days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a  tax on the individuals capital gains pursuant to the foreign investment in real property tax act which is referred to as firpta distributions to a nonus stockholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of usrpis whether or not designated as capital gain dividends will cause the nonus stockholder to be treated as recognizing such gain as income effectively connected with a us trade or business nonus stockholders would generally be taxed at the same rates applicable to us stockholders subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax we also will be required to withhold and to remit to the irs  or  to the extent provided in treasury regulations of any distribution to nonus stockholders that is designated as a capital gain dividend or if greater  of any distribution to nonus stockholders that could have been designated as a capital gain dividend the amount withheld is creditable against the nonus stockholders federal income tax liability however any distribution with respect to any class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states is not subject to firpta and therefore not subject to the  us withholding tax described above if the nonus stockholder did not own more than  of such class of stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the distribution instead such distributions will generally be treated as ordinary dividend distributions and subject to withholding in the manner described above with respect to ordinary dividends retention of net capital gains  although the law is not clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as retained net capital gains in respect of the capital stock held by stockholders generally should be treated with respect to nonus stockholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends under this approach the nonus stockholders would be able to offset as a credit against their federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax that we paid on such retained net capital gains and to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of such tax that we paid exceeds their actual federal income tax liability if we were to designate any portion of our net capital gain as retained net capital gain a nonus stockholder should consult its tax advisor regarding the taxation of such retained net capital gain    table of contents sale of our capital stock  except as described below under redemption or repurchase by us gain recognized by a non us stockholder upon the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock generally will not be subject to federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a usrpi in general stock of a domestic corporation that constitutes a us real property holding corporation or usrphc will constitute a usrpi we believe that we are a usrphc our capital stock will not however constitute a usrpi so long as we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity a domestically controlled qualified investment entity includes a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than  in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by nonus persons we believe but cannot guarantee that we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity because our common stock and our series b preferred stock are and we anticipate will continue to be publicly traded no assurance can be given that we will continue to be a domestically controlled qualified investment entity even if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity at the time a nonus stockholder sells our capital stock gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition by a nonus stockholder of such stock would not be subject to federal income taxation under firpta as a sale of a usrpi if    such class of stock is regularly traded as defined by applicable treasury regulations on an established securities market such as the nyse and    such nonus stockholder owned actually and constructively  or less of such class of our stock throughout the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange notwithstanding the foregoing gain from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock not otherwise subject to firpta will be taxable to a nonus stockholder if either a the investment in our capital stock is treated as effectively connected with the nonus stockholders us trade or business or b the nonus stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for  days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met in addition even if we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity upon disposition of our capital stock a nonus stockholder may be treated as having gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of a usrpi if the nonus stockholder  disposes of such stock within a day period preceding the exdividend date of a distribution any portion of which but for the disposition would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a usrpi and  acquires or enters into a contract or option to acquire or is deemed to acquire other shares of that stock during the day period beginning with the first day of the day period described in clause  subject to an exception applicable to regularly traded stock if the nonus stockholder did not own more than  of the stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the distribution described in clause  if gain on the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock were subject to taxation under firpta the nonus stockholder would be subject to regular federal income tax with respect to such gain in the same manner as a taxable us stockholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition if the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock were subject to taxation under firpta and if shares of our capital stock were not regularly traded on an established securities market the purchaser of such capital stock would generally be required to withhold and remit to the irs  of the purchase price redemption or repurchase by us  a redemption or repurchase of shares of our capital stock will be treated under section  of the code as a distribution and taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits unless the redemption or repurchase satisfies one of the tests set forth in section b of the code and is therefore treated as a sale or exchange of the redeemed or repurchased shares see taxation of taxable us stockholdersredemption or repurchase by us if the redemption or repurchase of shares is treated as a distribution the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received see taxation of nonus stockholdersdistributions generally if the redemption or repurchase of shares is not treated as a distribution it will be treated as a taxable sale or exchange in the manner described under
