only  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th do this if a security is not principally traded on a national securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate we determined the initial prices of the securities shown under portfolio in this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the new york stock

brokerdealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit redemption or sale requests selling units we may maintain a secondary market for units this means that if you want to sell your units we may buy them at the current net asset value we may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or redeem them for the redemption price our secondary market repurchase price is the same as the redemption price certain brokerdealers might also maintain a secondary market in units you should contact your financial professional for current repurchase prices

york stock exchange for you to receive the net asset value for a particular day if your request is received after that time or is incomplete in any way you will receive the next net asset value computed after the trustee receives your completed request if you redeem your units the trustee will generally send you a payment for your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary documentation this will usually only take three business days the only time the trustee can delay your payment is if the new york stock exchange is closed other than weekends or holidays the securities and exchange commission determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable and for any other period that the securities and exchange commission permits to redeem your units you must send the trustee any certificates for your units you must properly endorse your certificates or sign a

distribution of the securities underlying your units if you tender at least  units for redemption or such other amount as required by your financial professionals firm this option is generally

depository trust company you will receive whole shares of the applicable securities and cash equal to any fractional shares you may not request this option in the last  days of your trusts life we may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice notwithstanding the foregoing if the unitholder requesting an in kind distribution is  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th the sponsor or an affiliated person of the trust the trustee may make an in kind distribution to such unitholder provided that no one with a pecuniary incentive to influence the in kind distribution may influence selection of the distributed securities the distribution must consist of a pro rata distribution of all portfolio securities with limited exceptions and the in kind distribution may not favor such affiliated person to the detriment of any other unitholder distributions distributions your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year because it is structured as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change estimated annual distributions the estimated net annual distributions are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus we generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer or adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or on scheduled income payments however dividend conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividends paid or declared over several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions due to this and various other factors actual dividends received by the trust will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments the actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in dividends received and with the sale of securities reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time concentration risk is the risk that the value of your trust is more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry a portfolio concentrates in an industry when stocks in a particular industry make up  or more of the portfolio the trust invests significantly in community banks and their holding companies any negative impact on this industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of this industry before you invest these issuers face risks related to general economic conditions volatile interest rates economic recession competition from other financial services companies government regulation and portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans changes in interest rates can significantly impact the operating results of financial institutions increased interest rates may increase a banks interest income but may also increase the interest the bank pays on depository accounts and may lead to a decreased demand for loans lower interest rates may lead to increased prepayments on loans if a loan is paid off early the lending bank is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the prepayments at rates which are comparable to the rates on the prepaid loans economic conditions in real estate markets can also significantly impact banks because they often invest substantial assets in loans secured by real estate federal and state laws regulate financial institutions extensively any increase or change in regulations could adversely affect banks and thrifts in recent years however federal legislation has reduced certain barriers to interstate banking and branching by financial institutions in addition the federal reserve board has liberalized regulations that limit the ability of non bank subsidiaries of banks to engage in securitiesrelated businesses this and any future liberalization of banking regulations could result in increased competition which could negatively impact some companies banks also face significant competition from other financial companies that offer a broader array of products such as securities and brokerage companies credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies small and midsize companies the trust invests significantly in stocks issued by small and midsize companies the share prices of these companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors common to many such issuers including limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any security legislation or litigation risk is the risk that various legislative initiatives will be proposed from time to time in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities no fdic guarantee an investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency how the trust works your trust your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the investment company act of  we created the trust under a trust agreement between fixed income securities lp as depositorsponsor evaluator and

to us each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust these units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units and fractional interest of each unit in the trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment changing your portfolio your trust is not a managed fund unlike a managed fund your portfolio will remain relatively fixed your trust will generally buy and sell securities  to pay expenses  to issue additional units or redeem units  in limited circumstances to protect the trust  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust or  as permitted by the trust agreement when your trust sells securities the composition and diversity of the securities in the portfolio may be altered if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds if any contract for the purchase of securities fails the sponsor will refund the cash and sales fee attributable to the failed contract to unitholders on or before the next distribution date unless substantially all of the moneys held to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company we anticipate that the trusts initial offering will be one day however if we sell additional units we will increase the size of your trust if we create additional units we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio when your trust buys securities it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees you could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys the securities when your trust buys or sells securities we may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with your trust or the trustee amending the trust agreement the sponsor and the trustee can change the trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect your interest as determined by the sponsor and the trustee we cannot change this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent investors owning twothirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this agreement termination of your trust your trust will terminate on the termination date set forth under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus the trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust is less than  of the original value of the securities in the trust at the time of deposit at this size the expenses of your trust may create an undue burden on your investment investors owning twothirds of the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early the trustee will liquidate the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust if this happens we will refund any sales charge that you paid the trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any

or lose money when we deposit securities to create units the amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities into the trust is shown in the notes to portfolio taxes this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be designated by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these new capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself these special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   the trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the new capital gains tax rates inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust securities when you redeem units or when your trust terminates this distribution is subject to taxation and you will recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss deductibility of trust expenses generally expenses incurred by your trust will be deducted from the gross income received by your trust and only your share of the trusts net income will be paid to you and reported as taxable income to you however if the units of your trust are held by fewer than  unitholders at any time during a taxable year your trust will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income thus resulting in your reported share of the trusts taxable income being increased by your share of those expenses even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution in this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust designates as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly designated by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in the case of dividends with respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to  distributions from the trust that are properly designated by the trust as an interestrelated dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a shortterm capital gain dividend attributable to certain net shortterm capital gain income received by the trust may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met expenses your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations the fees and expenses section of the investment summary in this prospectus shows the estimated amount of these expenses your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services the trustee also benefits when it holds cash for your trust in noninterest bearing accounts your trust will reimburse us as supervisor evaluator and sponsor for providing

name advisors disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among fixed income securities lp as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york as trustee the sponsor provides services to unit investment trusts through its advisors asset management division when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in the trust and estimated income distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the securities in such trust thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each security if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees the trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the trust portfolio each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of common stocks of bank holding companies whose subsidiary banks are members of the independent community bankers of america howe barnes hoefer  arnett inc selected the stocks for the portfolio there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the prospectus provides additional information regarding the trusts objective and investment strategy the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in special circumstances as provided in the trust agreement thus the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged under normal circumstances the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may sell securities designated by the supervisor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in addition if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company including the requirements with respect to diversification under section  of the internal revenue code and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment company proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust the replacement securities must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed securities the replacement securities must be equity securities of the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust of the failed security exceeded the cost of the replacement security once all of the securities in a trust are acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the cash attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such cash they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust in the event that a replacement security is not acquired by a trust the income for such trust may be reduced  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th to the best of the sponsors knowledge there is no litigation pending as of the trusts inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust at any time after the trusts inception litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with respect to the securities the sponsor is unable to predict whether any such litigation may be instituted or if instituted whether such litigation might have a material adverse effect on the trust the sponsor and the trustee shall not be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security risk factors market risk because the trust invests in stocks you should understand the risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks and therefore units will fall stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time because the trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because some trusts hold a relatively small number of stocks you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment dividends stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock banking industry your trust is concentrated in securities of issuers in the banking industry banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin bank profits have come under pressure as net interest margins have contracted there is no certainty that such conditions will continue banks receive significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets if initial home purchasing and refinancing activity were to subside as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income would diminish economic conditions in the real estate markets which have been weak in the past can have a  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in the past to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws the impact of these laws on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the grammleach bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has also been enacted under the legislation banks are able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation may continue the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the securities in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit the sponsor makes no prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions the sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the securities or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained smallcap and midcap companies small and midsize company stocks have customarily involved more investment risk than large company stocks small and midsize companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack management depth or experience and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies some of these companies may distribute sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel the prices of small and midsize company securities are often more volatile than prices associated with large company issues and can display abrupt or erratic movements at times due to limited trading volumes and less publicly available information also because small and midsize companies normally have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies it may be more difficult for a trust which contains these securities to buy  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units in connection with these deposits existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and other acquisition costs administration of the trust distributions to unitholders income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account for the trust all other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate capital account for the trust the trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata share of the available balance of the income account of the trust all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account the trustee shall be required to make a distribution from the capital account if the cash balance on deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least  per unit the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds the distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to the unitholders pro rata share of the available balance of the income account of the trust after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner a person will become the owner of units and thereby a unitholder of record on the date of settlement provided payment has been received notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser but in the normal course of business the selling brokerdealer provides such notice the trustee will periodically deduct from the income account of a trust and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the capital account of a trust amounts necessary to pay the  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th expenses of the trust the trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of

to sell the securities as quickly as practicable during the termination proceedings without in its judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities but it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of within a reasonable time after a trusts termination the sponsor does not anticipate that the period will be longer than one month and it could be
