apr   at pm what happened shares of innoviva nasdaqinva a biotechnology royalty company that develops respiratory therapeutics and is perhaps best known as glaxosmithklines nysegsk development partner for its multiple nextgeneration copd and asthma products fell as much as  on thursday the reason behind innovivas bad day can be traced to a proxy battle with activist hedge fund sarissa capital management over seats on its board so what according to a press release from sarissa capital on wednesday evening since innoviva has thus far declined to comment innoviva had agreed to settle its proxy fight by allowing sarissa two board seats however according to reports innoviva continued to lobby for votes from shareholders without disclosing the fact that a deal had been reached with sarissa capital sarissa sent over the signed paperwork to innoviva on wednesday afternoon agreeing to the settlement but was told by innoviva that it would renege on its offer to place two of sarissas choices on its board when the smoke cleared innoviva had narrowly garnered enough votes to keep its own members on the board image source getty images sarissa capital management which owns  of innovivas outstanding shares has been critical of the companys executive compensation as glaxosmithklines partner for breo ellipta anoro ellipta incruse and arnuity innoviva has the sole task of managing the royalties it receives from glaxo sarissa alleges that high executivecompensation levels are reducing its profitability and hampering returns for shareholders thus sarissas failure to get any board seats is being construed as bad news for shareholders that any meaningful costcutting will happen in the near future for what its worth glaxosmithkline which has a  stake in innoviva opposed sarissas attempts to get their members on innovivas board now what while todays madefortv drama caused innovivas stock to tumble  and shareholders are clearly not pleased with having an activist investor lose out on board seats this probably isnt a longterm issue for the company innoviva has pledged to take a closer look at its executive compensation and with the matter now in the public light its unlikely that itll be swept under the rug whats far more important for innoviva shareholders at this point is the continued growth of it and glaxos respiratory products though these nextgeneration products offer new longlasting solutions to patients infiltrating the market is taking more time than expected physicians and consumers have been using mature and effective therapies for years and educating them that new choices are available is a tedious process it also has taken time for glaxosmithkline to gain adequate insurer coverage on its new therapies patient investors will probably be well rewarded with wall street projecting  in fullyear eps by  but well also need to see innoviva making a serious effort to cut costs and pay down its existing debt  sean williams

million these outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of  million capital return plans in october  we announced the acceleration of our capital return plan with an up to  million share repurchase program effective through the end of  the  share repurchase program in february  we announced a new capital return plan the  capital return plan the  capital return plan authorizes a combination of repurchases of stock andor repurchases redemptions or prepayments of debt up to  million through tender offers open market purchases private transactions exchange offers or other means through december   the  capital return plan is expected to be funded using our working capital we are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount of debt or equity or number of shares of common stock under the  capital return plan we will determine when if and how to proceed with any repurchase transactions under the program as well as the amount of any such repurchase transactions based upon among other things our evaluation of our liquidity and capital needs including for strategic and other opportunities our business results of operations and financial position and prospects general financial economic and market conditions prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock corporate regulatory and legal requirements and other conditions and factors deemed relevant by our management and board of directors from time to time our  capital return plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time there can be no assurance as to the actual volume of any debt or share repurchases in any given period or over the term of the program or as to the manner or terms of any such transactions from january   to december   we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of  per share for a total value of approximately  million in the open market pursuant to the  share repurchase program overall under the  share repurchase program we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of  per share for a total value of approximately  million repurchases of notes payable during the year ending december   we retired a portion of our  notes with a face value of  million and carrying value of  million by way of open market purchases the  notes were purchased for a total settlement price of  million resulting in a gain of  million as a result of the partial retirement of our  notes we entered into partial termination agreements of our capped call option transaction and received  million from the counterparty collaborative arrangements with gsk laba collaboration in november  we entered into our laba collaboration agreement with gsk to develop and commercialize oncedaily laba products for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and asthma the collaboration has developed two combination products  relvarrbreor elliptar ffvi breor elliptar is the proprietary name in the us and canada and relvarr elliptar is the proprietary name outside the us and canada a oncedaily combination medicine consisting of a laba vilanterol vi and an inhaled corticosteroid ics fluticasone furoate ff and  anoror elliptar umecvi a oncedaily medicine combining a longacting muscarinic antagonist lama umeclidinium bromide umec with a laba vi table of contents as a result of the launch and approval of relvarrbreor elliptar and anoror elliptar in the us japan and europe we paid milestone fees to gsk totaling  million during the year ended december   although we have no further milestone payment obligations to gsk pursuant to the laba collaboration agreement we continue to have ongoing participation as part of the collaboration including joint steering and joint project committees that are expected to continue over the life of the agreement the milestone fees paid to gsk were recognized as capitalized fees paid to a related party which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives commencing upon the commercial launch of the products we are entitled to receive royalties from gsk on sales of relvarrbreor elliptar as follows  on the first  billion of annual global net sales and  for all annual global net sales above  billion for other products combined with a laba from the laba collaboration such as anorotm elliptatm royalties are upward tiering and range from  to   strategic alliance in march  we entered into the strategic alliance agreement with gsk where gsk received an option to license exclusive development and commercialization rights to product candidates from certain of our discovery programs on predetermined terms and on an exclusive worldwide basis in  gsk licensed our maba program for the treatment of copd and in october  we and gsk expanded the maba program by adding six additional innovivadiscovered preclinical maba compounds the additional mabas gsk is responsible for funding all future development manufacturing and commercialization activities for product candidates in that program as a result of the spinoff we are only entitled to receive  of any contingent payments and royalties payable by gsk from sales of ffumecvi and maba and mabaff while theravance biopharma receives  of those same payments see part i item  business  our relationship with gsk   strategic alliance for more detail regarding the royalties payable by gsk under this agreement if any critical accounting policies and estimates our managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving managements judgments and estimates revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured where the revenue recognition criteria are not met we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time that all criteria are met collaborative arrangements and multiple element arrangements we generate revenue from collaboration and license agreements for the development and commercialization of product candidates under the gsk agreements revenue from nonrefundable upfront fees and development contingent payments were recognized ratably over the expected term of our performance of research and development services under the agreements these upfront or contingent payments received pending recognition as revenue were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated performance periods we recognize royalty revenue on licensee net sales of products with respect to which we table of contents have royalty rights in the period in which the royalties are earned and reported to us and collectability is reasonably assured royalty revenue earned is reduced by amortization expense resulting from the fees paid to gsk which were recognized as capitalized fees paid to a related party under the gsk agreements we recognized net revenue of  million  million and  million for the years ended december    and  respectively the remaining deferred revenue under the gsk strategic alliance agreement is  million as of december   any change in the estimated performance period which is predominantly based on gsks development timeline will not have a significant impact on the results of operations except for a change in estimated performance period resulting from the termination of the maba program that would result in immediate recognition of the deferred revenue capitalized fees paid to a related party we capitalize fees paid to licensors related to agreements for approved products or commercialized products capitalized fees our gross capitalized fees of  million as of december   consist of registrational and launchrelated to milestone fees paid to gsk we capitalized these fees as capitalized fees paid to a related party and amortize these capitalized fees on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives upon the commercial launch of the products the estimated useful lives of these capitalized fees are based on a countrybycountry and productbyproduct basis as the later of the expiration or termination of the last patent right covering the compound in such product in such country and  years from first commercial sale of such product in such country unless the agreement is terminated earlier consistent with our policy for classification of costs under the research and development collaborative arrangements the amortization of these capitalized fees is recognized as a reduction of royalty revenue amortization expense for the years ended december    and  were  million  million and  million respectively the remaining estimated amortization expense is  million for each of the years from  to  and  million thereafter we review our capitalized fees for impairment on a productbyproduct basis for each major geographic area when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the recoverability of capitalized fees is measured by comparing the assets carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate the determination of recoverability typically requires various estimates and assumptions including estimating the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the assets residual value if any we derive the required cash flow estimates from nearterm forecasted product sales and longterm projected sales in the corresponding market based upon our analyses no impairment charges have been recorded on the capitalized fees as of december   fair value of stockbased compensation awards we use the blackscholesmerton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options as of the date of grant the blackscholesmerton option valuation model requires the use of assumptions including the expected term of the award and the expected stock price volatility we use the simplified method as described in staff accounting bulletin no  share based payment for the expected option term we use our historical volatility to estimate expected stock price volatility the estimated fair value of the option is expensed on a ratable basis over the expected term of the grant we determine the fair value of rsus and rsas based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant the fair value of service based rsus and rsas is expensed on a ratable or straightline basis over the expected term of the vesting the fair value of performancecontingent rsus and rsas is expensed using an accelerated method over the requisite service period based on managements best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest we assess the probability of the performance indicators being met on a continuous basis the grant date fair value of the rsus and rsas with a market condition is determined using a monte carlo valuation model and the compensation expense is recognized over the implied service period stockbased compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and was reduced for estimated forfeitures as of the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates the estimated annual forfeiture rates for stock options rsus and rsas are based on our historical forfeiture experience table of contents for more information refer to note  stockbased compensation to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k amortization of debt issuance costs from nonrecourse notes payable due  in april  we entered into certain note purchase agreements relating to the private placement of  million aggregate principal amount of nonrecourse  fixed rate term notes due  the  notes issued by our whollyowned subsidiary the  notes are secured exclusively by a security interest in a segregated bank account established to receive  of royalties

make principal and interest payments on the  notes the  notes bear an annual interest rate of  with interest and principal paid quarterly beginning november   the  notes may be redeemed at any time prior to maturity in whole or in part at specified redemption premiums prior to may   in the event that the specified portion of royalties received in a quarter was less than the interest accrued for the quarter the principal amount of the  notes was increased by the interest shortfall amount for that period in connection with the issuance of the  notes we incurred approximately  million in transaction costs which are amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the  notes based on the effective interest method since the principal and interest payments on the  notes are based on royalties from product sales which vary from quarter to quarter the  notes may be repaid prior to the final maturity date in  to the extent that the interest or principal payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the debt issuance costs there are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of the royalty payments due to us under the laba collaboration with gsk most of which are not within our control such factors include but are not limited to the competitive landscape for approved products and developing therapies that compete with our partnered products the ability of patients to be able to afford our partnered products the size of the market for our partnered products safety concerns in the marketplace for respiratory therapies in general and with our partnered products in particular decisions as to the timing of product launches pricing and discounts and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments all of which would result in an impact to the amount of debt issuance

icslongacting beta   agonist laba combination from the twicedaily seretide ®  accuhaler ®  fluticasone propionate salmeterol fpsal  without compromising their lung function   patients randomised to ffvi taken oncedaily maintained a lung function comparable with those randomised to the twicedaily fpsal difference ml  ci ml ml meeting the studys primary end point based on lower bound ml of the  confidence interval falling above the noninferiority margin of ml   a third treatment arm with fluticasone propionate fp ics monotherapy was included to detect a lung function difference between treatments results demonstrated statistically significant differences in favour of the icslaba combinations to fp p   the incidences of ontreatment serious adverse events saes and adverse events aes of special interest were consistent with the known safety profile of ffvi established in asthma patients from other studies   eric dube svp and global head of respiratory franchise gsk said at gsk we are constantly searching for ways in which we can help patients better manage their asthma in this positive study we have demonstrated noninferiority for oncedaily relvar versus twicedaily seretide on lung function this gives us confidence that for patients who struggle taking a twicedaily treatment regimen there may be a oncedaily treatment option available providing greater physician choice to help patients   mike aguiar ceo of innoviva inc added we believe the results of this study are important for patients and physicians they provide additional evidence that patients with persistent asthma who are currently treated with a twicedaily icslaba in this case seretide can experience a similar level of benefit in lung function when treated with relvar ellipta which only needs to be taken once a day   the study design was agreed with european regulatory authorities gsk now intends to submit this data to the european medicines agency ema   results from the study will be shared in future publications and presentations   study design   following a week openlabel treatment period with fpsal  twicedaily patients with well controlled asthma were randomised to receive either ffvi  oncedaily fpsal  twicedaily or fp  twicedaily in a doubleblind doubledummy manner for  weeks at multiple centres in  countries   the primary objective of the study was to demonstrate noninferiority of relvar ellipta  oncedaily with seretide accuhaler  twicedaily in adult and adolescent subjects  years of age and older     press release click to enlarge   click to enlarge   with persistent bronchial asthma well controlled on twicedaily icslaba the endpoint for the study was the change from baseline in clinic visit evening fev  prebrochodilator and predose at the end of the week treatment period   to demonstrate the non inferiority of ffvi vs fpsal the lower limit of the  confidence interval for the mean difference in change from baseline for evening fev   needed to be greater than the pre defined margin of ml this was to rule out the possibility that ffvi was more than ml inferior to fpsal   about asthma   asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways   asthma affects  million people worldwide despite medical advances more than half of patients continue to experience poor control and significant symptoms impacting their daily life   the causes of asthma are not completely understood but likely involve an interaction between a persons genetic makeup and the environment key risk factors are inhaled substances that provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways   about relvar ellipta fluticasone furoate  vilanterol   relvar ellipta is a oncedaily dual combination treatment comprising fluticasone furoate an inhaled corticosteroid and vilanterol a longacting beta  agonist in a single inhaler the ellipta ®    relvar ellipta is indicated in europe in the regular treatment of patients aged  and over with asthma where use of a combination product longacting ßagonist laba and inhaled corticosteroid ics is appropriate patients not adequately controlled on both ics and asneeded shortacting ß  agonist saba   full eu prescribing information is available at  eu prescribing information for relvar ellipta   important safety information for relvar ellipta in europe   ffvi  is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either fluticasone furoate vilanterol or any of the excipients   ffvi should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or an acute exacerbation in copd for which a shortacting bronchodilator is required increasing use of shortacting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control and patients should be reviewed by a physician   patients should not stop therapy with ffvi in asthma or copd without physician supervision since symptoms may recur after discontinuation   asthmarelated adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with ffvi patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of treatment with ffvi   paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing this should be treated immediately with a shortacting inhaled bronchodilator ffvi should be discontinued immediately the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary   cardiovascular effects such as cardiac arrhythmias eg supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles may be seen with sympathomimetic medicinal products including ffvi therefore fluticasone furoatevilanterol should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disease   for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment the  mcg dose should be used and patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroidrelated adverse reactions ffvi  mcg is not indicated for patients with copd there is no additional benefit of the  mcg dose compared to the  mcg dose and there is a potential increased risk of pneumonia and systemic corticosteroidrelated adverse reactions   page    press release click to enlarge   click to enlarge   an increase in the incidence of pneumonia has been observed in subjects with copd receiving  ffvi there was also an increased incidence of pneumonias resulting in hospitalisation in some instances these pneumonia events were fatal   the incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma was common at the higher dose in a previous study of ffvi in asthma the incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma taking ffvi  mcg was numerically higher compared with those receiving ffvi  mcg or placebo   hyperglycaemia there have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in diabetic patients and this should be considered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus   systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids possible systemic effects include  cushings syndrome cushingoid features adrenal suppression decrease in bone mineral density growth retardation in children and adolescents cataract and glaucoma and more rarely a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity sleep disorders anxiety depression or aggression particularly in children   ffvi should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or in patients with chronic or untreated infections data from large asthma and copd clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions associated with ffvi   very common adverse reactions occurring in  patients with ffvi were headache and nasopharyngitis common adverse reactions occurring in  to  patients were pneumonia upper respiratory tract infection bronchitis influenza candidiasis of mouth and throat oropharyngeal pain sinusitis pharyngitis rhinitis cough dysphonia abdominal pain arthralgia back pain fractures and pyrexia and muscle spasmsextrasystoles were observed as an uncommon adverse reaction occurring in  to  patients rare adverse reactions occurring in  to   were hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis angioedema rash and urticaria anxiety tremor palpitations tachycardia and paradoxical bronchospasm with the exception of pneumonia and fractures the safety profile was similar in patients with asthma and copd during clinical studies pneumonia and fractures were more frequently observed in patients with copd   relvar ellipta is known as breo ellipta in the united states breo ellipta is licensed in the us for   ·                   the oncedaily treatment of asthma in patients aged  years and older   longacting betaadrenergic agonists laba  such as vilanterol one of the active ingredients in breo ellipta increase the risk of asthmarelated death available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that laba increase the risk of asthmarelated hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients therefore when treating patients with asthma physicians should only prescribe breo ellipta for patients not adequately controlled on a longterm asthma control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled
