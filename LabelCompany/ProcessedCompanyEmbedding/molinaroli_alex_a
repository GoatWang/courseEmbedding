horne molinaroli sues neighbors condo group embattled johnson controls ceo hasnt yet moved in but legal sparks fly by michael horne  aug th   pm signup for the urban milwaukee daily email construction continues on the property photo by michael horne alex molinaroli the everembattled johnson controls ceo filed a lawsuit on august th against his future neighbors kostantinos p agoudemos and stacy miller who own the park terrace bluff homes condominium next to the one molinaroli is extensively remodeling for his own use just north of commerce st and west of humboldt ave at the heart of the matter is a narrow strip of land that separates the two condos is it a common area or one for the use of the abutting agoudemos and miller property does molinaroli’s construction project encroach on the neighbors for which they should be compensated or has it been approved by the condo association as part of his construction agreement these are not easy questions in the world of condominium law molinaroli’s remodeling of the substantial end unit has been going on for months — too long according to the association his improvements include the installation of a swimming pool which would require substantial upgrades in the hvac system to mitigate the effects of the pool’s heater on the general atmosphere of the residence molinaroli’s contractors installed some vent pipes on his building in what the respondents allege is an area under their domain molinaroli alleges otherwise citing condominium documents and concessions he made to the neighbors to compensate them for the construction by upgrading their ventilation systems at considerable expense three air conditioning units can be seen operating in the space screened somewhat from the neighbors’ deck there but apparently something went wrong to sour relations after certain easements were granted to molinaroli agoudemos and miller wrote to molinaroli and kristin ihle his companion that “the new pipes whistle so loud it’s a nuisance” the condo association cited the “the exhaust pipe and not approved service and utility lines” that led to molinaroli’s condo in a letter on july nd to molinaroli the association also complained that the “construction completion deadline had lapsed” it “reserved the right to amend” the complaint to add to the list if necessary wrote association president mona patel things get personal video camera photo by michael horne agoudemos and miller also raised a question about a security camera which might seem an unusual feature but perhaps not in the home of a ceo who makes over a million dollars a month most of the neighbors probably have to get by on under  per week “the camera that will overlook my yard is a violation of our privacy rights” wrote agoudemos referring to the couple’s initial contacts with their new neighbor agoudemos wrote “we wholeheartedly believed you were a generous person we feel you guys have taken advantage of our kindness …we would also like to know what your camera is pointing at yes i am trying to be a dick about it” molinaroli’s lawyer bruce mcilnay responded that “agoudemos was convicted of selling drugs in ozaukee county” however i have found no evidence of this in the ozaukee county circuit court records where one would expect a criminal drug sales charge to have been filed fourth claim for relief lawyer claims neighbors attempting to “extort” molinaroli molinaroli’s request for relief concluded with these statements “agoudemos and miller by their actions have interfered with molanaroli’s easement granted by the association and have through their intimidation of the directors of the association via emails and verbal threats caused molinaroli monetary damages including for this case …in an amount to be proven at trial “such interference was without justification or privilege but was intended to extort money or gifts from molinaroli for exercising is sic rights under the easement “such wrongful intent is evidenced by agoudemos’ and miller’s statements ‘that alex could offer them  … on top of work to be done and they wouldn’t accept it …they even commented that alex should have purchased their unit from then when they had made that suggestion” not first dispute for neighbors or molinaroli agoudemos and miller have a history of suing in their neighborhood they have an open lawsuit against bryan mardak the previous owner of their property it was filed in  as for molinaroli he has been immersed in controversy for years as we reported in may  his wife patsy threw him out of the house after she discovered he was having an affair for good measure she shot the place up with a  caliber pistol and took an aluminum bat to an arcade game windows and a china cabinet in their  million brookfield home molinaroli moved to a onebedroom penthouse unit in the park lafayette tower as bloombergcom has reported molinaroli’s tenure as johnson controls ceo has been marked by “one lurid headline after another” including his extramarital affair and divorce a finding by his board of directors that he violated company ethics and the fact the he was among those questioned in a federal department of justice investigation of a ponzi scheme molinaroli “was both the victim of ponzi scheme artist joseph zada and provided financial support after the fraudster was charged” bloomberg noted “after zada’s conviction in september the federal prosecutor disclosed that molinaroli had purchased the swindler’s home in grosse pointe shores michigan and allowed him to continue to live there rentfree covered zada’s legal bills and offered to provide millions of dollars in restitution for victims” in the latest controversy shareholders “voted overwhelmingly to oppose the  million in ‘golden parachute’ payments and a  million retention bonus being granted to molinaroli as part of a merger agreement with tyco international” as the journal sentinel has reported a class action suit has also been launched arguing that molinaroli and other johnson control executives are being unfairly enriched so compared to all that this dispute with the neighbors is small potatoes for molinaroli who has asked for a declaratory judgment allowing him to continue using the disputed space between the buildings no further court dates have been scheduled at this time before judge

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
