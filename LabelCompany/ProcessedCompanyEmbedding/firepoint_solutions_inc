one place from our clients don’t take our word for it see what others say about firepoint i’ve been purchasing pay per click leads for the last decade  firepoint’s leads are by far the least expensive and highest quality i’ve ever seen  they matched my commissions inc price per lead in the first month and i had a client under contract my second month after starting with firepoint  i get more good phone numbers from firepoint leads than any other vendor i’ve worked with  i highly recommend firepoint for lead generation   ron petzel firepoint is taking the industry by storm the transparency in ppc campaigns is particularly unique i’ve used other systems and they are only willing to share the number of leads and the average cost per lead with firepoint you have a say in how the ad budget is spent you can decide if you want   leads   leads or   dollar leads for the first time a company is transparent and collaborative with how to run my ppc campaign also with firepoint i can instantly see how much i’m spending on one lead source and put them in order from best to worst roi   rob kittle team in fort collins  homes sold last year i run a large team which is driven by our inside sales department firepoint allows us to automate followup campaigns and tasks and track the entire conversion process our inside sales agents isa’s can assign leads to agents see exactly what is and isn’t being completed and where balls might be dropping the accountability page allows me to keep an eye on my team and see if anyone is falling behind in their work and tracking my roi with the reporting feature helps me sleep at night and make wise decisions about future spending   chad madlom real estate agent in colorado  homes sold i interviewed demoed all the major companies before selecting firepoint in december of  i had a set budget and because firepoint had a slightly lower platform price it allowed me to spend much more on my ppc campaign than had i gone with another more expensive crm my results have been astounding  days in and i have  leads in my crm all but  from my pay per click campaign i have taken  active listing and they will be buying i am working with  oth er buyers out of the other  many others are responsive and we have made plans over the next few months to meet people visit my site repeatedly daily and it’s so fun to wake up each day and see who is online opening my emails it is work and i follow up with text and calls like crazy but it works if you follow up people love my search site one of my leads that was not from my ppc was from someone who “shared” it with a family member on facebook angela cutter being the  producer in my market means i have to always stay on the cutting edge of technology i paid an arm and a leg for the old systems i was using and i had to wait months to see any progress or new features with firepoint i’m not breaking the bank and i see improvements rolling out every week   damon gettier team in central and southwest virginia  homes sold last year with  officesteams and  transactions closed in a year we needed to automate our business and see exactly what our conversion rates and rois were at one point we were using  different platforms but now with firepoint we can see everything we need in our business in just one program   thom dallmanup to  homes sold per year i’d like to thank firepoint for the impeccable customer service i had an issue of a listing not appearing on my site within  mins at pm a rep was working to resolve the problem and on monday my account rep called to follow up to make sure all was well  star customer service is very rare these days firepoint client care goes the extra mile josh foster i chose firepoint after conducting indepth research on them and their competitors the idx website works seamlessly for our clients and we constantly receive compliments from new leads in just two months their transparent ppc practices gave us a consistent flow of leads that would normally take six months to realize firepoint’s dedication to their clients is unmatched from our experience in the real estate industry our account manager is responsive and attentive and functions as an extension of our team as a company built by actual agents their team understands our needs and consistently delivers on their promises   alex acuff firepoint helped me easily transition from another system i was using and now i can manage all of my team’s leads tasks and past clients in one place our other lead sources come into firepoint automatically so my agents never have to log into another system firepoint increased my company’s productivity and systematically changed the way i manage my business   jeffrey chubb remax agent in boston ma we run a team that produces  sales per year so we need a system that keeps us efficient organized and that helps us effectively communicate with firepoint we love being able to assign multiple team members to a lead including agents loan officers and staff and that everyone on the team can see all communication with the lead the feature i lean on the most though is the accountability page – if i could have one person just watch that page  i would   homer  rachael tyre team in greenville nc firepoint has revolutionized my business having been on two other top systems and crm’s i immediately saw the value in what the firepoint team created what i love most is that this system was created by real estate professionals not just web developers who thought they knew the needs of agents every serious agent or team owner needs to be on this system   bruce hill firepoint was a game changer for us operating on multiple platforms made us inefficient after switching to firepoint our productivity increased  now i can’t imagine running our team without firepoint’s lead distribution rules – they are much more robust than a simple round robin approach i believe that firepoint is the allinone solution for the real estate industry   saul zenkevicius team in the us  homes sold per year my background is with high producing teams and expensive lead generation systems after recently going solo i realized i couldn’t afford some of the bigger crms and looked for a more economical solution i also wanted to work with a company that was started by people in the real estate industry and not just by “techy” people after much research i stumbled upon firepoint and decided to give it a try i was prepared to “get what you pay for” but my experience has been the exact opposite i get a great amount of leads on a small budget and the customer service is out of this world i’m always able to get in touch with the company and they’re always excited to hear new suggestions firepoint has surpassed the level of service from any of the bigger systems i’ve used i’m a very satisfied client   cassie springer firepoint is amazing it’s a lot faster than the other system i was using and has more accountability features than any crm out there now that my team is using firepoint we’re increasing our conversion rate on the same number of leads i’m excited about where firepoint is heading   michael perna team in the us for keller
