at  bering drive suite  houston texas   the companys telephone number is   its fax number is   and its website is wwwsummerenergycom  the information accessible through the companys website does not constitute part of and is not incorporated by reference into this annual report summer llc was organized as a texas limited liability company on april   by the filing of a certificate of organization with the texas secretary of state  in september of  summer llc was awarded a license by the public utility commission of texas puct to operate as an rep in texas  in general texas regulatory structure permits reps such as summer llc to procure and sell electricity at unregulated prices  reps pay the local transmission and distribution utilities a regulated tariff rate for delivering electricity to their customers  as an rep we sell electricity and provide the related billing customer service collections and remittance services to residential and commercial customers  we offer our customers competitive electricity rates flexible payment and pricing choices simple offers with understandable terms and responsive customer service we offer retail electricity to commercial and residential customers in designated target markets within the state of texas  in the commercial market the primary targets are small to mediumsized customers less than one megawatt of peak usage but we will also selectively pursue larger commercial customers through managements existing historical relationships  residential customers are a secondary target market  at this time a majority of our customers are located in the houston and dallasfort worth metropolitan areas although we anticipate a growing number will be located in a variety of other metropolitan and rural areas within texas we rely upon established relationships and lowcost branding programs to attract commercial and residential customers  we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our areas of operations within texas as certain market regions elect to optin to deregulation  in addition we continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire other reps to the extent these acquisitions would provide value to us in most jurisdictions we are required to enter into agreements with local transmission and distribution service providers for use of the local distribution and transmission systems and operation of functional interfaces necessary for us to serve our customers with respect to energy supply we utilize wholesale purchase agreements with wholesale energy providers  we serve as our own qualified scheduling entity for open market purchases and sales of electricity forecasting our energy demand and conducting procurement activities through an experienced team of professionals the forecast for electricity load requirements is based on our aggregate customer base currently served and anticipated weather conditions as well as forecasted customer acquisition and attrition we continuously monitor and update our supply positions based on our retail demand forecasts and market conditions our policy is to maintain a balanced supplydemand book to limit commodity risk exposure  at this time we do not plan on maintaining a financial book in addition to our physical supplydemand book for riskhedging purposes we began delivering electricity to customers in midfebruary   we have continued to experience growth in our customer base since that time as of december   we had  fulltime employees our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe our employee relations are good  table of contents   regulatory environment and the texas retail electric market deregulation of the wholesale electricity market in texas began in  enabling independent power generators andor suppliers to  i establish operations in texas alongside those of the regulated utilities and ii gain access to the transmission capabilities of the power grid additional legislation in  created an integrated marketplace by linking generators transmission and delivery companies reps and the independent grid operator which is the electric reliability council of texas ercot  beginning january  pursuant to senate bill  texas electricity consumers had the choice of picking their retail electricity provider or rep  as a result of these legislative developments former integrated utilities were essentially split apart into three business segments  unregulated wholesale power generators  regulated transmission and distribution service providers tdsps and  unregulated reps in the market reps that were spun off from previously integrated utilities are referred to as affiliated reps when affiliated reps operate in their incumbent markets an incumbent market refers to those areas previously served by the integrated utility they are sometimes referred to as incumbent reps  incumbent reps are subject to restrictions on their ability to compete on price in their incumbent markets in order to foster competition  the two largest affiliated reps in texas are txu and reliant energy situated in the dallasft worth and houston areas respectively the primary responsibilities of an rep in texas include customer account initiation and termination energy supply management and scheduling billingremittance processing and customer service  all reps must be certified by ercot to operate within the texas market ercot was founded in  and it oversees all aspects of the texas power grid for the deregulated market  under deregulation ercot serves as the independent system operator iso of the power grid and enables reps generators tdsps and ultimately customers to operate in a deregulated marketplace  ercot is responsible for coordinating and monitoring all communications by and between the power generator the retail electric provider and the tdsp including customer sign up meter reading and billing between the end user power generator and the rep subsequent legislative developments in texas following its initial efforts at deregulation texas adopted subsequent legislation that i  allowed retail customers situated in the ercot region of texas to choose an rep  ii permitted reps who are not affiliated with an incumbent utility in a particular market to with certain exceptions directly disconnect customers who fail to pay their power bills in a timely manner and  iii removed pricing restrictions otherwise known as price to beat from incumbentaffiliated reps creating a true deregulated competitive market markets outside of texas if the company enters deregulated markets outside of texas we will be required to operate within the specific regulatory environment of such state or region the rules in the other markets vary from texas with some aspects being more favorable and some less favorable than texas we will evaluate the regulatory environment of each market in addition to other operational financial and customer considerations before determining whether to pursue other market area opportunities marketing and sales the company is in the process of implementing a multitiered marketing and sales strategy  the shortterm emphasis is on controlled growth utilizing indirect marketing through thirdparty relationships indirect marketing efforts including the following allow the company to facilitate growth while keeping expenses low by avoiding the expense associated with creating and managing a full sales team · aggregators brokers consultants  often referred to as abcs in the retail power industry  table of contents · affinity programs  airline miles credit card points and participating gift cards · multifamily housing programs  incentivizing property management companies based on referrals to their tenants · referrals  reaching out to individuals connected to the community and providing incentives for signups and · charitable programs  enhancing referral programs and offering customers the chance to donate referral fees to local charitable organizations as the company grows we expect to achieve longterm growth by building our inhouse sales team to manage our thirdparty as well as our direct marketing efforts  our direct marketing efforts include or will include without limitation · inhouse sales staff focused on small to medium sized commercial sales · facetoface marketing including presentations customer meetings and business development through newlyformed relationships with consumers aka cold calling · direct sales using independent sales associates · responding to website inquiries from commercial businesses · identifying opportunities in underserved markets eg south texas and west texas and · community involvement  establishing our brand throughout the community by giving back and volunteering our time and assistance relationship marketing will play a key role in both channels and should facilitate growth in the marketplace competition and perceived competitive advantages as more fully set forth under the heading entitled risk factors the company faces competition from many competitors who have significantly greater financial resources wellestablished brand names and large existing installed customer bases we expect the level of competition to intensify in the future  there is also significant competition from incumbent traditional and new electricity providers which may be better capitalized than the company it is understood that there is significant competition in the retail electric market however most established competitors target the larger customer segment such as large commercial and industrial operations  this creates a niche that we aggressively target we focus on small to medium size commercial residential and select large businesses in our core marketing efforts  we believe this market segment will yield a higher perunitmargin with improved customer loyalty the company anticipates the addition of new market participants  recent entries into the marketplace include singleclient companies established for a select number of large electricity users such as refineries or industrial plants  these new participants strategy is to focus most of their marketing dollars on highend users as they assume the larger customers provide the highest return   the company differentiates its strategy by focusing on the small to midsize customer segment and building lasting relationships through excellent customer service flexible terms unique sales techniques and competitive pricing the companys present management and staff have significant experience working in the texas retail energy market  management and staff also have experience with retail electric providers who operate in maryland the district of columbia and massachusetts  we believe managements experience with these entities will contribute to managements ability to market and grow the company into a successful retail electricity provider in texas because of managements prior experience management and staff have developed and maintained strong connections with agents brokers property owners and others in the texas market  through these relationships the company anticipates building sales momentum  table of contents intellectual property the company has not applied for any patents or copyrights  the company has filed a trademark application for summer energy  the company has not spent any significant time since its inception on research and development activities additional information as more fully set forth under the heading entitled risk factors the company is subject to governmental regulation and will face additional costs in complying with such regulations  at this time the company does not have an estimate of its annual regulatory compliance costs item a risk factors before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this annual report and in our other filings with the sec including subsequent reports on forms q and k the risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on the company our business financial condition results of operations andor liquidity could be seriously harmed in that event the market price of our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in general risks factors related to our business and industry we have a relatively limited operating history and limited historical financial information upon which you may evaluate our performance you should consider among other factors our prospects for success in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies that like us are in a relatively early stage of development we may not successfully address the usual and ordinary risks and uncertainties associated with being an early stage company or successfully implement our existing and new products and services if we fail to do so it could materially harm our business even if we accomplish these objectives we may not generate the positive cash flows or profits we anticipate in the future unanticipated problems expenses and delays are frequently encountered in establishing a new business and developing new products and services  these include but are not limited to inadequate funding lack of consumer acceptance competition product development and inadequate sales and marketing our failure to meet any of these conditions would have a material adverse effect upon us and may force us to reduce or curtail our operations no assurance can be given that we will operate profitably  even though we are being managed by individuals with significant industry experience our limited operating history makes it difficult to predict the longterm success of our business model we depend on key personnel for the foreseeable future our success will depend largely on managements industry knowledge marketing skills and relationships with key investors customer bases and industry leaders the company has employment agreements with management and other key personnel  should any of these individuals leave the company it may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  table of contents recourse to the companys assets outside of our wholesale contracts our customer contracts and our rep certificate the company currently has limited assets that are available to satisfy liabilities and other obligations of the company  if the company becomes subject to a liability parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to the companys assets we will indemnify management and the members of the board of directors these key decisionmakers will be entitled to indemnification from the company except in certain circumstances as more fully set forth in our articles of incorporation bylaws and separate indemnification agreements stockholders will have no right to participate in management of the company stockholders in the company will not have the right to participate in the management of the company or in decisions made by the management on the companys behalf  as a result stockholders will have almost no control over their investments in the company or their prospects with respect thereto uncertain economic conditions recent economic events have created uncertainty with respect to the condition of the economy in the united states certain economic factors and indicators have suggested that such events have had a substantial negative effect on the economies of the united states and texas  furthermore several industries have experienced financial difficulties  in addition there have been material adverse effects on the worlds economies caused by illegal activities in the business and accounting professions resulting in significant declines in the united states equity markets  other equity markets have been similarly affected  it is impossible to determine at this time the longterm effects of these events and conditions on the economy any negative change in the general economic conditions could adversely affect the financial condition and our operating results unforeseen incidents such as terrorist attacks corporate fraud or general weakness in the economy could have a negative impact on the overall economic state of the market in which we intend to market and utilize our products and services  the company may experience difficulty in raising additional capital necessary for expenses and growth may experience underfunding due to the timing of payments received and due to the seasonality of the texas market and customer electricity usage adequacy of funds for operations or capital expenditures to the extent that the companys expenses increase unanticipated expenses arise or capital expenditures are necessary and accumulated reserves are insufficient to meet such expenses the company may be required to obtain cash advances and additional funds through borrowing or additional equity raises if available  such debt andor equity raises may have a material negative adverse effect on the companys profitability we are dependent on a single party to purchase our electricity we are party to an energy marketing agreement for electric power with dte energy trading inc dte whereby with limited exceptions we are required to purchase all of our electric power and associated services requirements from dte  we therefore rely on dte in order to meet our customers needs  if we default in our obligations to dte we may be unable to purchase the required electricity supply to service our customers  if we are unable to purchase through dte we may be forced to purchase substantial electricity supply in the open market to meet customer demand at a time when energy prices are volatile which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition our obligations to dte are secured by a first position security interest in all of our assets equipment and inventory  table of contents our rep certification is subject to puct review the puct the public utility commission of texas may at any time initiate an investigation into whether our operations comply with puct rules and whether we have met all of the requirements for rep certification including financial requirements  any revocation of our rep certification would mean that we would no longer be allowed to provide electricity to retail customers  such decertification would undoubtedly have a material effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition volatile energy prices and regulatory risk sustained high energy prices andor ongoing price volatility also creates a risk of increased regulatory andor legislative intervention which may limit our flexibility within the deregulated market  in addition ercot possesses significant regulatory control over our business  factors outside of our control may cause ercot to change its regulatory structure at any time which may have an adverse effect upon our business additionally the puct may impose rules and regulations that adversely affect the companys operations finances and business practices the company believes that competitive markets yield a broad range of innovative prices and service alternatives to consumers and ultimately lead to the most efficient use of resources  we believe regulatory entities should continue to take actions that encourage competition in the industry but no assurance can be given that this will be the case regulatory andor legislative intervention could disrupt the relationship in electricity prices which could impact the companys results of operations  the companys earnings and cash flows may also be adversely affected in any period in which the demand for power significantly varies from forecasted supply which may occur due to among other factors weather events competition and economic conditions reliance on transmission and distribution service providers tdsps affiliated with our competitors to perform some functions for our customers   under our regulatory structure we will be required to enter into agreements with local incumbent utilities for use of the local distribution systems and for the creation and operation of functional interfaces necessary for us to serve our customers while we are optimistic about our ability to enter into acceptable agreements in texas any delay in future negotiations for access or our inability to enter into reasonable agreements to operate could delay or negatively impact our ability to serve our customers which could have a material negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition   we are dependent on tdsps for maintenance of the infrastructure through which we deliver electricity to our retail customers any infrastructure failure that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity to our customers could negatively impact the satisfaction of our customers with our service and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow  additionally we are dependent on tdsps for performing service initiations and changes and for reading our customers energy meters we are required to rely on the tdsps or in some cases ercot to provide us with our customers information regarding energy usage and we may be limited in our ability to confirm the accuracy of the information the provision of inaccurate information or delayed provision of such information by the tdsps or ercot could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow  in addition any operational problems with our new systems and processes could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow  further we rely on the tdsps to properly repair and maintain electrical lines in outages caused by severe weather which may produce a delay in providing service to the companys customers which can negatively impact the company we are subject to government regulation and extensive government regulation may increase our costs and slow our growth   significant regulations imposed at the federal state and local levels govern the provision of utility services and affect our business and our existing and potential competitors  delays in receiving required regulatory approvals the enactment of adverse legislation regulations or regulatory requirements or the application of existing laws and regulations to certain services may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow in addition future legislative judicial and regulatory agency actions could alter competitive conditions in the markets in which we intend to operate in ways not necessarily to our advantage  table of contents   in addition ercot has and may continue to modify the market structure and other market mechanisms in an attempt to improve market efficiency moreover existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to our commercial activities these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial conditions and cash flows new legislation or regulation we cannot determine what effect additional state or federal governmental legislation regulations or administrative orders when and if promulgated would have on our business in the future new legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of our business to meet new standards require us to cease operations impose stricter qualification andor registration standards impose additional record keeping or require expanded consumer protection measures   reliance on information technology systems collection of sensitive customer data   our business is dependent on information sharing among market participants including ercot the tdsps and thirdparty service providers this information includes customer enrollment information ercot transactions meter readings invoices for wire line charges etc  therefore our success as an independent rep is impacted by our ability to handle this information and we are dependent on third parties to provide timely and accurate information to us we rely on a combination of internal systems including telephone internet load forecasting as well as systems operated by third parties  failure to receive timely and accurate information could have an adverse impact on our business   we have implemented or intend to implement both processes and infrastructure to provide for redundancy of core data due to business interruption associated with our billing platform however that is only one component of our business model in addition our systems and those we rely upon from third parties need continued development and investment to ensure reliability and scalability as our business grows at a rapid rate   despite the implementation of security measures our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other disruptive problems a party who is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our internet operations we may be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures there can be no assurance that measures implemented by us will not be circumvented in the future our business requires access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business examples of sensitive customer data are names addresses account information historical electricity usage expected patterns of use payment history credit bureau data credit and debit card account numbers drivers license numbers social security numbers and bank account information we may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services it is possible that our security controls over personal data our training of employees and consultants on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information  if a significant breach occurred our reputation may be adversely affected customer confidence may be diminished or our business may be subject to legal claims any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on the business andor results of operations certain political and natural events may affect our company catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event or natural disaster could cause delays in performing critical functions  a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results  table of contents weather and other related commodity risks may affect our ability to manage and maintain a balanced supplydemand book   commitments for future purchase of electricity supply forward power contracts are based not only on our expected customer base at a given point in time but also weather forecasts for the geographical areas in which we operate we plan to maintain a long position in our forward power contracts contracted electricity supply purchases are slightly greater than forecasted demand by our customers to minimize the need to purchase power on the balancing markets at varying market prices however fluctuations in actual weather conditions may have an impact on the actual power needs of customers on a given day extreme weather conditions may force us to purchase electricity in the balancing market on days when weather is unexpectedly severe and the pricing for balancing market energy may be significantly higher on such days than the cost of electricity in our existing fixed priced contracts unusually mild weather conditions could leave us with excess power which may be sold in the balancing market at a loss if the balancing market price is lower than the companys cost of electricity in our existing fixed priced contracts   commodity pricing is an inherent component of our business operations and our financial results the prevailing market prices for electricity and fuel may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time potentially adversely impacting our results of operations financial condition and cash flows changes in market prices for electricity and fuel may result from any of the following  · weather conditions · seasonality · demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions · forced or unscheduled plant outages · disruption of electricity or gas transmission or transportation infrastructure or other constraints or inefficiencies · addition of generating capacity  · availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources · availability and levels of storage and inventory for fuel stocks · natural gas crude oil and refined products and coal production levels · the creditworthiness or bankruptcy or other financial distress of market participants · changes in market liquidity · natural disasters wars embargoes acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events and · federal and state governmental regulation and legislation we may have difficulty obtaining a sufficient number of customers we anticipate that we will incur significant costs as we enter new markets and pursue customers by utilizing a variety of marketing methods in order for us to recover these expenses we must attract and retain a large number of customers  while the company is optimistic there can be no assurance that efforts to secure customers will provide the revenue base needed to succeed in texas andor expand into additional markets we may experience difficulty attracting customers because many customers may be reluctant to switch to a new supplier for a commodity as critical to their wellbeing as electric power a major focus of our ongoing marketing efforts will be to demonstrate to potential customers that we will be a reliable provider with sufficient resources to meet our commitments if our marketing strategy does not prove to be successful our business results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected we bear the credit risk and billing responsibility for our customers   in texas the sole market in which we currently operate we are responsible for the billing and collection functions for our customers as we seek to expand our operations into additional markets the billing and collection functions may also be our responsibility in many of these markets we may be limited in our ability to terminate service to customers who are delinquent in payment  even if we terminate service to customers who fail to pay their electricity bill in a timely manner we may remain liable to our suppliers and to the local utilities for services related to the transmission and distribution of the electricity the failure of our customers to pay their bills in a timely manner or our failure to maintain adequate billing and collection programs could materially adversely affect our business  table of contents   we may not be able to manage our growth successfully the development of our operations will depend upon among other things our ability to create and expand our customer base in texas and to enter new markets in a timely manner and at reasonable costs in addition we anticipate that our employee base will grow in order for us to accommodate our increased customer base we may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is diverse both with respect to the types of services they will require the market rules in their jurisdiction and the infrastructure required to deliver electricity to those customers expanding our operations may also require continued development of our operating and financial controls and may place additional stress on our management finances and operational resources if we are unable to manage our growth and development successfully our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected   we face strong competition from incumbent utilities and other competitors the market in which the company operates is highly competitive  the company faces competition from many competitors with significantly greater financial resources wellestablished brand names and large existing installed customer bases we expect the level of competition to intensify in the future  we expect significant competition from incumbent traditional and new electricity providers which may be better capitalized than the company in most markets our principal competitor may be the local incumbent utilitys unregulated affiliates  these affiliates have the advantage of longstanding relationships with their customers and they may have longer operating histories greater financial and other resources and greater name recognition in their markets than we do  in addition incumbent utilities have been subject to regulatory oversight in some cases for close to a century and thus have a significant amount of experience regarding the regulators policy preferences as well as a critical economic interest in the outcome of proceedings concerning their revenues and terms and conditions of service some of our competitors including affiliated retailers have formed alliances and joint ventures in order to compete in the restructured deregulated retail electricity industry  many customers of these incumbent utilities may decide to stay with their longtime energy provider if they have been satisfied with its service in the past in addition to competition from the incumbent utilities and their affiliates we face competition from a number of other energy service providers including startup companies focusing on internet marketing and online services and other energy industry participants who may develop businesses that will compete with us in both local and national markets  many of these competitors or potential competitors are   larger than the company and have access to more significant capital resources payment defaults by other reps to ercot in the event of a default by an rep of its payment obligations to ercot the portion of that obligation that is unrecoverable by ercot from the defaulting rep is assumed by the remaining market participants in proportion to each participants load ratio as an rep and market participant in ercot we may have to pay a portion of the amount owed to ercot should such a default occur and ercot is not successful in recovering such amounts as an early stage company any such default of an rep in its obligations to ercot could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial conditions and cash flows ercot has experienced problems with its information systems problems in the flow of information between ercot tdsps and the reps have resulted in delays and other problems in enrolling and billing customers when customer enrollment transactions are not successfully processed by all involved parties ownership records in the various systems supporting the market are not synchronized properly and subsequent transactions for billing and settlement are adversely affected the impact may mean that we are not listed as the electric providerofrecord for intended or agreed upon time periods delays in receiving customer consumption data that is necessary for billing and settlement either through ercot or directly with tdsps as well as the incorrect application of rates or prices and imbalances in our electricity supply forecast and actual sales  table of contents   our future results of operations may be negatively impacted by settlement adjustments determined by ercot related to prior periods settlement information for most operating activity is due from ercot within two months after the operating day and trueup settlements are due from ercot within six months after the operating day  ercot has the ability to resettle any operating day at any time after the six month settlement period usually the result of a lingering dispute an alternative dispute resolution process or litigated event as a result we are subject to settlement adjustments from ercot related to prior periods which may result in charges or credits impacting our future reported results of operations our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by any development or event beyond our control that causes economic weakness in the ercot market we are not geographically diversified  we derive substantially all of our revenues from operations in the ercot market which covers approximately  of the geographical area in the state of texas  as a result regardless of the state of the economy in areas outside the ercot market economic weakness in the ercot market could lead to reduced demand for electricity in the ercot market such a reduction could have a material negative impact on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition risks related to the company we may have contingent liabilities related to the companys operations prior to the transaction of which we are not aware and for which we have not adequately provisioned prior to the consummation of the transaction the company was engaged in the business of manufacturing and installing decorative window wells made from precast concrete  we cannot ensure that there are no material claims outstanding or other circumstances of which we are not aware that would give rise to a material liability relating to these prior operations even though we have not recorded any provisions in our financial statements related to such potential liabilities if we are subject to past claims or material obligations relating to our operations prior to the consummation of the transaction such claims could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect our financial resources and our ability to operate our business we are party with blue water capital funding llc the lender to and liable with our subsidiary summer llc for up to  million of outstanding debt under a revolving loan a loan agreement and accompanying revolving promissory note collectively the loan agreement  the maturity date of the outstanding loan agreement is june    our resulting substantial level of indebtedness and other financial obligations increase the possibility that we may be unable to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness  further under the loan agreement we are subject to certain restrictive covenants that among other things may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital requirements product development activities debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes these restrictive covenants include without limitation restrictions on our ability to  incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  make certain dispositions of assets  merge dissolve consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets and  enter into certain transactions with affiliates during the term of the loan agreement  if we breach any of these restrictive covenants or are unable to pay our indebtedness under the loan agreement when due this could result in a default under the loan agreement  in such event the lender may elect after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable under the loan agreement to be immediately due and payable any such occurrence would have an immediate and materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations the loan agreement is secured by a second position security interest in all assets of the company  table of contents   risks related to the transaction and the ownership of the common stock of the company we face increased costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies any failure to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting or to recruit train and retain necessary accounting and finance personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately and timely prepare our consolidated financial statements as a public operating company we incur significant administrative legal accounting and other burdens and expenses beyond those of a private company including those associated with corporate governance requirements and public company reporting obligations  in particular we may need to enhance and supplement our internal accounting resources with additional accounting and finance personnel with the requisite technical and public company experience and expertise as well as refine our quarterly and annual financial statement closing process to enable us to satisfy such reporting obligations  however even if we are successful in doing so there can be no assurance that our finance and accounting organization will be able to adequately meet the increased demands that result from being a public company furthermore we are required to comply with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  in order to satisfy the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and prepare annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  these assessments will need to include disclosure of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  testing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting will involve significant costs and could divert managements attention from other matters that are important to our business  additionally we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in remediating any deficiencies that may be identified if we are unable to remediate any such deficiencies or otherwise fail to establish and maintain adequate accounting systems and internal control over financial reporting or we are unable to recruit train and retain necessary accounting and finance personnel we may not be able to accurately and timely prepare our consolidated financial statements and otherwise satisfy our public reporting obligations any inaccuracies in our financial statements or other public disclosures in particular if resulting in the need to restate previously filed financial statements or delays in our making required sec filings could have a material adverse effect on the confidence in our financial reporting our credibility in the marketplace and the trading price of our common stock we devote significant resources to address these public companyassociated requirements including compliance programs and investor relations as well as our financial reporting obligations complying with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more timeconsuming and costly an active liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not develop and the price of our stock may be volatile and may decline in value there currently is not an active public market for our common stock an active trading market may not develop or if developed may not be sustained the lack of an active market may impair the ability of stockholders to sell shares of common stock at the time they wish to sell them or at a price they consider reasonable  an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with securities traded in those markets  broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance  table of contents the company may not be able to attract the attention of brokerage firms because the transaction is characterized as a reverse acquisition securities analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of the company   no assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of the company in the future should the need arise our common stock may not be eligible for listing on a national securities exchange our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange and we do not currently meet the initial quantitative listing standards of a national securities exchange we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of any national securities exchange or if we do meet such initial qualitative listing standards that we will be able to maintain any such listing  our common stock is currently quoted on the otc markets and until our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange we expect that it will continue to be eligible and quoted on the otc markets another overthecounter quotation system or in the pink sheets  in these venues an investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock  in addition if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in sec regulations various requirements would be imposed by law on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors  consequently such regulations may deter brokerdealers from recommending or selling our common stock which may further affect its liquidity  this would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital in the future the companys common stock may be considered a penny stock and may be difficult to sell the sec has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to specific exemptions  the market price of our common stock is likely to be less than  per share and therefore may be designated as a penny stock according to sec rules  this designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities  these rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares our stockholders may experience significant dilution if future equity offerings are used to fund operations or acquire complementary businesses if we engage in capital raising activities in the future including issuances of common stock to fund the growth of our business our stockholders could experience significant dilution  in addition securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock we have an equity incentive plan pursuant to which equity awards may be granted to eligible employees including our executive officers directors and consultants if our board of directors determines that it is in the best interest of the company and our stockholders to do so the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of any such equity awards may result in dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect our earnings if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us our business or our market or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely our stock price and trading volume could decline the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us our business our market or our competitors and if any analysts do publish such reports what they publish in those reports we may not obtain analyst coverage in the future any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock adversely change their recommendations from time to time andor provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors if any analyst who may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all we could lose or never gain visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline  table of contents we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future the forward looking statements contained in this annual report may prove

operations are conducted through s ummer llc marketing llc was formed in the state of texas on november   to provide marketing services to summer llc summer ohio was formed in the state of ohio on december   to procure and sell electricity in the state of ohio   the public utilities of ohio puco issued a certificate of a retail electric service provider to summer ohio on june     at this time there is no business activity in the state of ohio  table of contents   overview our wholly owned subsidiary summer llc is a licensed retail electricity provider rep in the state of texas  in general texas regulatory structure permits reps such as summer llc to procure and sell electricity at unregulated prices  reps pay the local transmission and distribution utilities a regulated tariff rate for delivering electricity to their customers  as a rep we sell electricity and provide the related billing customer service collections and remittance services to residential and commercial customers  we offer retail electricity to commercial and residential customers in designated target markets within the state of texas  in the commercial market the primary target is small to mediumsized customers less than one megawatt of peak usage but we will also selectively pursue larger commercial customers through managements existing historical relationships  residential customers are a secondary target market  we anticipate that a majority of our customers will be located in the houston and dallasfort worth metropolitan areas although we anticipate a growing number will be located in a variety of other metropolitan and rural areas within texas we began delivering electricity to customers in midfebruary  during the year ended  we added ten fulltime employees to our workforce and we anticipate these staffing additions will enable us to effectively expand our presence throughout texas as of december   we had  fulltime employees   application of critical accounting policies   the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are in managements view most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of our judgment the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us which is referred to as gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates including those related to stockbased compensation customer programs and incentives bad debts supply inventories intangible assets income taxes contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we consider the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment revenue recognition our electricity revenue is recognized by our company upon delivery of electricity to a customers meter  this method of revenue recognition is commonly referred to as the flow method  the flow method of revenue relies upon electric reliability council of texas ercot settlement statements to determine the estimated revenue for a given month supply delivered to customers for the month measured on a daily basis provides the basis for revenues  electricity revenue consists of proceeds from energy sales including pass through charges from the transmission and distribution providers tdsps billed to the customer at cost  table of contents unbilled revenue and accounts receivable electric services not billed by monthend are accrued based upon estimated deliveries to customers as tracked and recorded by ercot multiplied by our  average billing rate per kilowatt hour kwh in effect at the time  at the end of each calendar month revenue is accrued to unbilled receivables based on the estimated amount of power delivered to customers using the flow technique  unbilled revenue also includes accruals for estimated tdsp charges and monthly service charges applicable to the estimated electricity usage for the period  all charges that were physically billed to customers in the calendar month are recorded from the unbilled account to the customer receivable account  accounts receivable are customer obligations billed at the conclusion of a months electricity usage and due within  days of the date of the invoice  balances past due are subject to a late fee that is assessed on that billing cost recognition direct energy costs are recorded when the electricity is delivered to the customers meter cost of goods sold cogs include electric power purchased and pass through charges from the tdsps in the areas serviced by the company  tdsp charges are costs for metering services and maintenance of the electric grid  tdsp charges are established by regulation of the public utility commission of texas puct the energy portion of our cogs is comprised of two components  bilateral wholesale costs and balancingancillary costs  these two cost components are incurred and recognized differently as follows bilateral wholesale costs are incurred through contractual arrangements with wholesale power suppliers for firm delivery of power at a fixed volume and fixed price  we are invoiced for these wholesale volumes at the end of each calendar month for the volumes purchased for delivery during the month with payment due  days after the end of the month balancingancillary costs are based on the customer load and are determined by ercot through a multiple step settlement process  balancing costsrevenues are related to the differential between supply that we provided through our bilateral wholesale supply and the supply required to serve our customer load  the company endeavors to minimize the amount of balancingancillary costs through our load forecasting and forward purchasing stockbased compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance stockbased compensation cost granted to employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period which is the vesting period stock options and warrants issued to consultants and other nonemployees as compensation for services to be provided to us are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair value of the option or warrant whichever can be more clearly determined we currently use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options the determination of the fair value of stockbased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected term of the award the riskfree interest rate and any expected dividends compensation cost associated with grants of restricted stock units are also measured at fair value we evaluate the assumptions used to value restricted stock units on a quarterly basis when factors change including the market price of the stock sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense income taxes the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of taxrelated assets and liabilities and income tax expense these estimates and assumptions are based on the requirements of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes our policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of income tax expense  table of contents   we assess whether previously unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized when the tax position is  more likely than not of being sustained based on its technical merits  effectively settled through examination negotiation or litigation or  settled through actual expiration of the relevant tax statutes implementation of this requirement requires the exercise of significant judgment recognizing deferred tax assets will increase tax benefits and increase net income income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the period in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date the company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than  likely of being realized changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs the company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense new customer implementation costs we ordinarily incur additional costs to implement our services for new customers these costs are comprised primarily of additional labor and support these costs are expensed as incurred and have a negative impact on our statements of operations and cash flows during the implementation phase warrants the companys common stock warrants are measured at fair value using the blackscholes valuation model which takes into account as of the measurement date factors including the current exercise price the term of the instrument the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility expected dividends on the stock and the riskfree interest rate for the term of the item the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in its application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result please see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin

private placements of our common stock and warrants general  the companys increase in net cash flows during  when compared to the year ended december   is attributable to  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december   and  cash used in investing activities during that same period including  used for the purchase of property and equipment and net cash of  provided from financing activities primarily from  received by the company from the sale of our common stock through private placements conducted in    during the year ended  the companys decrease in net cash flows was attributable to  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december   and  cash used in investing activities during that same period including  used for the purchase of property and equipment and net cash of  provided from financing activities primarily from  proceeds received from long term notes payable the company has no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses products product rights or technologies however we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of andor investments in products technologies or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions andor investments in the future accordingly we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions andor investments we may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms if at all  if we are able to obtain additional financing such financing may result in restrictions on our operations in the case of debt financing or substantial dilution for stockholders in the case of equity financing  table of contents cash outflows for capital assets customer acquisition and deposits we expect to expend funds for   capital assets customer acquisition and deposits in connection with the expansion of our business in the upcoming year ending december    the anticipated source of funds is electricity revenues lending and capital raised in the upcoming year ending december     future financing needs the company did not commence operations and the generation of revenue until the middle of the three month period ended march     management believes that we have adequate liquidity to support operations  but this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks while we believe in the viability of our plan of operations and strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances that our plan of operations or ability to raise capital will be successful  the ability to grow is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan generate revenues and obtain additional financing if and as needed offbalance sheet arrangements our existing wholesale power purchase agreement provides that we will provide additional credit support to cover marktomarket risk in connection with the purchase of long term power  a marktomarket credit risk occurs when the price of previously purchased long term power is greater than the current market price for power purchased for the same term  while we believe that the current environment of historically low power prices limits our exposure to risk a collateral call should it occur could limit our working capital and if we fail to meet the collateral call could cause liquidation of power positions related party transactions   on august   the company entered into two five  year credit facility agreements with two members of the companys

requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results may differ from these estimates revenue recognition our electricity revenue is recognized by our company upon delivery of electricity to a customers meter  this method of revenue recognition is commonly referred to as the flow method  the flow method of revenue relies upon electric reliability council of texas ercot settlement statements to determine the estimated revenue for a given month  supply delivered to customers for the month measured on a daily basis provides the basis for revenues  electricity revenue consists of proceeds from energy sales including pass through charges from the transmission and distribution providers tdsps billed to the customer at cost unbilled revenue and accounts receivable electric services not billed by monthend are accrued based upon estimated deliveries to customers as tracked and recorded by ercot multiplied by our average billing rate per kilowatt hour kwh f   table of contents note   significant accounting policies continuted in effect at the time  at the end of each calendar month revenue is accrued to unbilled receivables based on the estimated amount of power delivered to customers using the flow technique  unbilled revenue also includes accruals for estimated tdsp charges and monthly service charges applicable to the estimated electricity usage for the period  all charges that were physically billed in the calendar month are recorded from the unbilled account to the customers receivable account  unbilled accounts as of december   and  were estimated at  and  respectively accounts receivable are customer obligations billed at the customers monthly meter read date for that periods electricity usage and due within  days of the date of the invoice the balances past due are customers subject to a late fee that is assessed on that billing the company determines the allowance based upon a review of

include electric power purchased and pass through charges from the tdsps in the areas serviced by the company  tdsp charges are costs for metering services and maintenance of the electric grid  tdsp charges are established by regulation of the puct the energy portion of our cogs is comprised of two components bilateral wholesale costs and balancingancillary costs  these two cost components are incurred and recognized differently as follows bilateral wholesale costs are incurred through contractual arrangements with wholesale power suppliers for firm delivery of power at a fixed volume and fixed price  we are invoiced for these wholesale volumes at the end of each calendar month for the volumes purchased for delivery during the month with payment due  days after the end of the month balancingancillary costs are based on the customer load and are determined by ercot through a multiple step settlement process  balancing costsrevenues are related to the differential between supply that we provided through our bilateral wholesale supply and the supply required to serve our customer load  the company endeavors to minimize the amount of balancingancillary costs through our load forecasting and forward purchasing programs basic and diluted incomeloss per share basic incomeloss per share are computed by dividing net incomeloss applicable to the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding during the period  diluted income per share is determined using the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share equivalents using the treasury method consisting of shares that might be issued upon exercise of share equivalents  in periods where losses are reported the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding excludes share equivalents of  as of december   because their inclusion would be antidilutive f   table of contents note   significant accounting policies continued stockbased compensation under the fair value

are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair value of the option or warrant whichever can be more clearly determined we currently use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  the determination of the fair value of stockbased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected term of the award the riskfree interest rate and any expected dividends compensation cost associated with grants of restricted stock units are also measured at fair value we evaluate the assumptions used to value restricted stock units on a quarterly basis when factors change including the market price of the stock sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in
