reputation fix it the right way corporate advocacy program™ seo reputation management at its best i was hired at tropicana products aka tropicana manufacturing in bradenton fl on  i am a  rated disabled veteran and gave full disclosure at time of hire they even made me get a medical second opinion at my own expense prior to hire i did this and was hired keep in mind that as far as the job itself and the pay and benefits go this is an excellent job and i like it i am not some disgruntled whiner the hours are long and you can work  days a week for several weeks without a day off and those shifts can be and often are  hours per day with only  hours between punch out and punch in which allows for a maximum of  hours sleep i was working in the fruit recieving dept up until  when the long hours and short recovery time were starting to aggravate my overall health and my disability after working  hours on  hours sleep getting off at am i went into the plant medical office to inquire about what accomodations were available to me as a disabled person all i wanted was some sort of work hour restriction that would give me  hours between shifts instead of  as with my injuriesdisability it took me almost an hour just to be able to get around after getting up well this was a short discussion as the nurse elizabeth harris went straight to the hr office which is connected by a hallway and with her came tulsa everett the senior hr rep at that time without any discussion or evaluation tulsa removed me from the job without any documentation which i requested and was denied not only did she take me off the job she deactivated my access badge and timecard as would be done when terminating an employee but i was not terminated i was simply off the job without status or communication i filed a grievance with the union teamsters local  and after being out of work  weeks was paid my full back pay but still not put back to work i was told i had to get another medical evaluation at my own expense and get a release that stated without restrictions before i could come back to work well being permanently disabled this would be impossible after  more months of fighting i got back to work in another department the original complaint was at this time allegedly resolved in the mean time the  hr reps involved are removed from hr  was fired eric rivera and  is reassigned tulsa everett therefore tropicana knows there is a problem here and risk of a lawsuit for the blatant ada violations tropicana is owned by pepsico and is part of the qtg division quakertropicanagatorade however  months later they are right back to the  hour shifts with  hours in between and once again my condition is aggravated this time i need medical treatment to resolve the pain and loss of mobility however i can and do keep performing my job just in great pain i make a medical appointment and a course of action being lumbar traction therapy is prescribed tropicana denies my right to medical care and calls it an unexcused absence they deny me the opportunity to get treatment that takes only  hour twice per week even though i scheduled it outside normal duty hours so only forced overtime would be affected so i file a formal written request with the hr dept jenny williams hr director which is quickly denied without any real evaluation and they attack my character etc then jenny williams removes me from the job again without status or documentation once more this time i am out of work for another  weeks i am now out almost  in lost pay which has been denied  times through the union grievance procedure even with a rock solid case and abundant documentation of all events and the prior violation pete hayes hr manager fabricates testimony and documents to get me off the job and keep me off the job i get paid for a few weeks and get put back to work but  weeks lost time and all of my expenses etc remain unpaid i have a usdol ofccp complaint filed for the blatant ada violations which is being handled by carlos gamazo of the usdol ofccp which is the office of contract compliance as both tropicana and pepsico are federal contractors and must meet higher standards and have a  compliance rate with ada and other programs for disabled persons and veterans that is where it is at now possible federal and state sanctions as well as me having to sue them at my own expense for the violations please give me your thoughts and experiences if you have worked for these companies or know someone that has if you are an experienced lawyer in

medical evaluation at my own expense and get a release that stated without restrictions before i could come back to work i said well being permanently disabled this would be impossible  after  more months of fighting i got back to work in another department the original complaint was at this time allegedly resolved the ada violation itself was never addressed or corrected it remains unresolved to this day and tropicana management continues with the same behavior in the mean time the  hr reps involved are removed from hr  was fired eric rivera and  is reassigned tulsa everett therefore tropicana knows there is a problem here and risk of a lawsuit for the blatant ada violations tropicana is owned by pepsico and is part of the qtg division quakertropicanagatorade the paragraph above should read in the mean time the  hr reps involved are removed from hr  was fired eric rivera and  is reassigned tulsa everett therefore i believe tropicana knows there is a problem in their hr dept and an apparant risk of a lawsuit for the blatant violations they rountinely engage in tropicana is owned by pepsico and is part of the qtg division quakertropicanagatorade however approximately  months later they are right back to the  hour shifts with  hours in between punch out and punch in and once again my condition is aggravated this time i need medical treatment to resolve the pain and loss of mobility however i can and do keep performing my job just in great pain i make a medical appointment and a course of action being lumbar traction therapy is prescribed by dr chris flaim of

scheduled it outside normal duty hours so only forced overtime would possibly be affected so i file a formal written request for reasonable accomodation under the provisions of the ada with the hr

to work but  weeks lost time and all of my expenses etc remain unpaid the paragraph above should read pete hayes hr manager fabricates a document to my doctor being a falsified and greatly exaggerated job description to get me off the job and keep me off the job this fabricated letter was obviously engineered to get a specific response and he got what he wanted i get paid for a few days in that first week and they pay me full pay to stay home for the last  weeks and then get put back to work but approximately  weeks lost time and all of my expenses etc remain unpaid i have a usdol ofccp complaint filed for the blatant ada violations which is being handled by carlos gamazo of the usdol ofccp which is the office of contract compliance as both tropicana and pepsico are federal

usa  legal disclaimer all of the statements made here are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and nothing here is meant to be of a defamatory nature towards anyone i simply want my money due me and the underlying problems fixed so others do not have to go through what i have gone through respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  author of original report more validation for javier feliciano as requested in an email to me  author steve  usa submitted saturday september   posted saturday september   i already corrected the scumbag comment issue bob corrected me and i already posted the correction sorry pete i was wrong on that issue you called me a dirtbag not a scumbag my mistake please accept my apology as far as the email goes re the  go away money etc presented at the jac bob told me that this was misrepresented by pete and more weight was put on that part of the email to poison the board and it worked yes the entire email was presented in the case but that was the point that was emphasized as per bobs conversation with me immediately after the decision on my case was made this is my union representative so i trust what he tells me as far as the illegalunethical activity on the part of tropicana hr on my case that is all documented and through the  different cases you should already have all of that documentation in my file as it was all provided by me and presented in my case last year as well as this year and carlos had every piece of paper on this case as well which was presented here is a summary of what i have documents on  i go into the plant medical office on  to simply ask about workhour accomodation for my known disability tulsa immediately pulls me off the job without cause or documentation or status  i ask for written job status tulsa says we dont do that  immediate notification of adverse action was not made to my union by the company this is a blatant contract violation  tulsa deactivates my card and blocks my access to the plant all without any documentation on my job status she disables swipe entry and posts wackenhut guards at each gate i was turned away as per tulsa everetts order to wackenhut and i have a signed letter by the wackenhut officer eric attempts to keep me off the job along with tulsa everett but ignoring and willfully ignoring my calls to the job hotline for work during seasonal layoff and at the resolution of my first case i have the chain of emails to back this up i also presented phone records to back up my claim that i called numerous times i can once again contact my cell phone providers to get these as i recall there were like  calls to the job hotline by me and i never got a job from it however i do know that  temps were hired in for positions i requested eric got the ok from wendell and his reason was that he had no volunteers on about  i make a written request for reasonable accomodation under the ada and once again am removed from the job without cause this time by jenny i have ample documentation of this entire chain of events therefore my claim of discrimination against disabled persons by tropicana hrmanagement is validated especially as you tropicana hr settled my first case and paid full back pay then this year jenny paid me grievance pay for the remainder first week when she pulled me off the job which indicates admission of wrongdoing as well as the last  weeks i was paid full pay to stay home i am missing the approx  weeks in the middle so if you paid at the start and at the end why was i not paid for the time in the middle jenny forcibly removed me from the job based on a falsified letter with greatly exaggerated job standards to my doctor i have this letter with petes signature on it as well as the job description he sent and the official job description provided to my initial doctor by the medical office they are very different and i have done the job and can testify that the requirements pete stated are not what the job involves that letter was obviously written with one purpose in mind to pull me off the job i have all of the written documentation that lead up to this as well where my requests for exused time for medical care were denied even though i only needed  hour twice per week and the appts were already scheduled outside my normal duty hours tropicana hr blatantly refused to comply my doctors request tropicana hr refused to provide any reasonable accomodation under the ada as requested these are documented facts tropicanas way of dealing with anything is to get rid of the employee that is common knowledge too respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  author of original report correction of initial statement to tropicana hr last friday author steve  usa submitted tuesday september   posted tuesday september   javier i was just informed by bob tuttle that i was wrong regarding the derogatory statement made by pete hayes about me i said in my statement to you last friday that bob tuttle told me that pete hayes called me a scumbag during last years grc on my initial case bob tuttle corrected me yesterday at the union meeting and said that pete hayes called me a dirtbag not a scumbag that is real professional of your hr manager to use that kind of language towards an employee during an official company meeting with a union representative this conduct was on company time and on company premises which violates many pepsicos policies and standards keep in mind that my statement was not made on company time and was not made on company property either nor was it made as a reperesentative of the company actually you have no say over that statement i made at all it is irrelevent and no company policy was violated nor was any contract item violated by my statement but pete was in violation for sure the only recourse on that statement is for pete to file a civil suit on me i welcome him to do just that thank you respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  author of original report the letter to pete hayes hr  tropicana bradenton author steve  usa submitted thursday september   posted thursday september   titled regarding the blogs you enquired about pete i understand you contacted bob tuttle yesterday about some alleged blogs on the internet i will be glad to give you the urls to each or print them out and fax them to you if you prefer i am not hiding anything here and i am only stating the documented facts nothing illegal here and nothing in violation of company policy im just excercising my constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech are you going to now attempt to violate my constitutional rights as well as my rights under the ada etc the facts are clear that you and other members of management violated my rights and engaged in retaliation against me when i stood up for my rights you alone had several opportunities to make this right and you chose not to do so so now you have left me no other choice in dealing with this i am taking it to the next level the world i bey you will really enjoy my new website dedicated to you alone and also my new video dedicated to the entire management team at tropicana the tentative title is incompetence gone wild that is because everything that happened to me was either due to total arrogance or total incompetence on the part of all involved and there is nothing illegal or against company policy regarding telling it like it is and i will be telling the world as per your choice this is on you not me thanks steve respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  author of original report update and clarification of prior information author steve  usa submitted thursday september   posted thursday september   first i found out yesterday by my union rep bob tuttle of teamsters local  that pete hayes called him in regards to this post and others like it on the internet he got the info from someone at pepsico whose sole job appears to be looking online for stuff like this pete hayes informed bob tuttle that we have our lawyers looking into those blogs etc i guess this was supposed to be some form of intimidation i guess hell be real impressed when my website and my video get released i will have a website dedicated just to this issue of discrimination and retaliation against disabled persons and veterans and the title for my video will be incompetence gone wild and pete hayes will be the star second i want to clarify that the written request i made to the company jenny williams was worded as request for reasonable accomodation under the provisions of the ada a company with over  employees working  shifts  could not accomodate a legally disabled veteran needing only  hour twice per week for essential medical care however they accomodate others by putting them on light duty for weeks at a time where someone else has to do their job and they give people off on sunday to go to church when requested etc if you are a disabled person you should steer clear of this group of companies they will not accomodate you now that i have stood up for my rights i am the bad guy i am the boatrocker and troublemaker pete hayes has used derogatory terms to describe me to others as some of them have informed me im a bad guy because i stood up for my legal rights actually my human rights but management at tropicana is just that inhuman however they themselves fail to show up for days at a time andor come in late leave early take  hour lunches etc therefore they get their medical care when needed

develop over the years peter began to amass a very extensive collection of photographs of people he met he attended many events and met many famed individuals of the time he always took the time to research people before meeting them and was able to talk with them about their careers their travels and even their families this impressed them and they felt comfortable in his company many became
