approach is a critical aspect of our longterm buyandhold strategy we seek to opportunistically buy and sell positions over time buy discipline patience and conviction characterize our buy discipline we take time to understand an investment before making a decision to purchase having determined an entry price we are willing to wait for the stock to come to us we typically build positions over time when conditions warrant we may move quickly market volatility creates unique buying opportunities following a sell off we may take advantage of depressed prices to initiate positions or add to existing positions historically these opportunities have made an important contribution to portfolio returns sell discipline when a stock appreciates to our target price we review the investment to determine whether our target should be raised or the position liquidated if a stock faces persistent selling pressure while its investment merits remain intact we may use the opportunity to add to our position our investment philosophy of identifying high quality businesses is an important component of our buysell discipline superior businesses grow over time their intrinsic values rise accordingly this discipline of owning exceptional companies dovetails with our longterm investment strategy and minimizes the need for portfolio turnover trading at pacific global we do not utilize a separate trading department our portfolio managers control the entire trading process they determine the price timing and commission of each trade this approach provides the flexibility and opportunity to respond to changing market conditions we establish a target price for each stock which is based on various methodologies including relative valuation discounted cash flow analysis sumoftheparts
