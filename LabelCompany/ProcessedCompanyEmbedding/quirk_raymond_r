thursday july the  the replay number is  with an access code of  let me now turn the call over to our chairman bill foley william p foley ii  chairman thanks dan this quarter clearly highlights the earnings power of our title insurance business we experienced continued midsingledigit growth in the purchase market a slight decline in commercial revenue and lower refinance closings yet we were still able to generate the  adjusted pretax title margin with the decline in interest rates in late june weve already begun to see meaningful sequential increases in refinance openings in each of the last three weeks which bodes for improved third quarter refinance closings as we enter the second half of  we will continue to strive to maximize earnings from our operations and remain the mostprofitable title insurance company in the country black knight continued its strong financial performance generating  revenue growth in the second quarter adjusted ebitda was  million  million increase or  over the second quarter of  and adjusted ebitda margin was  a  basis point improvement over the second quarter of  fnfs black knight ownership stake is currently worth approximately  billion or more than  per fnf share during the second quarter we consistently repurchased  shares of fnfs stock a day other than during blackout periods around our first quarter earnings release in april for the second quarter we repurchased a total of nearly  million shares at a total cost of  million we also spent approximately  million on our quarterly cash dividend on the acquisition front we made seven smaller title acquisitions for a total cost of approximately  million so we continue to use our significant free cash flow to both return value to our shareholders and invest in the future of our title business ill now turn the call to randy quirk to discuss the title insurance business raymond r quirk  chief executive officer thank you bill as bill mentioned this was a strong quarter for our title operations as we again led the industry with a  adjusted pretax title margin our adjusted pretax title earnings of  million or a  million increase over the strong second quarter of  while a  adjusted pretax title margin was equal to the prior year the agency growth continues to be stronger than direct with nearly  agency revenue growth over the second quarter of  as some of the big agent markets in the southeast and east coast have continued to perform better than the west coast this year however with the recent increase in refinance orders that growth may shift more towards the direct operations in the western states in california in particular and where much of the refinance volume will take place in april we added  positions in the title business due to the increased order volumes however despite continued seasonal orders rate during may and june we actually reduced head count by  positions as the operational impact of trid declined significantly as the quarter progressed we feel confident saying that the negative trid impact is now effectively behind us in addition we also reduced  corporate positions in the second quarter as a result of our overall corporate expense reduction plan for the second quarter total open orders averaged approximately  per day with april at  may at  and june at more than  the last week of june was actually at more than  orders per day fntg purchase orders opened and closed orders in the second quarter increased by  and  respectively the mix towards purchase transactions was approximately  and  respectively for open and closed orders during the quarter for the first two weeks of july total open orders per day grew to more than  with last weeks orders generate more than  open orders per day refinance represented  of those open orders and fntg purchaserelated open orders increased by  versus the same two weeks in july of  we had another strong quarter in our commercial business generating  million in total commercial revenue a  decrease from the second quarter of  driven by a  increase in closed commercial orders offset by a  decline in the fee per file national commercial revenue of  million declined by  as closed orders declined by  and the fee per file grew by  in the first half of  the commercial market remained strong and we expect good commercial performance in the back half of  the total fee per file of  increased by  versus the second quarter of  as the mix shifted to more purchase closings in the second quarter versus the second quarter of  if the increase in refinance orders continues we would expect the fee per file to decline let me now turn the call over to tony park to review the financial highlights anthony j park  chief financial officer thank you randy we generated more than  billion in total revenue in the second quarter with title generating  billion in total revenue black knight contributing  million in total revenue and our corporate and other segment generating  million which is predominantly our real estate brokerage revenue adjusted pretax title earnings were  million a  million or  increase over the second quarter of  and the adjusted pretax title margin was  adjusted net earnings were  million or  per diluted share the title segment generated  billion in total revenue for the second quarter a  increase over the second quarter of  direct title premiums declined by  while agency premiums increased by  personnel costs increased by  but as randy mentioned the  operational and  corporate head count reductions came in may and june and we would not have seen much if any of that benefit in the second quarter but we do expect to see the benefit of those actions in the third quarter other operating expenses declined by  million fnf group debt outstanding was  billion with more than  billion of that debt at black knight our debt to total capital on a consolidated basis was approximately  at june  on an fnfonly basis the debttocap ratio was approximately  and  on the guarantee on the  million of black knight debt is included total title claims paid were  million during the second quarter an increase of  million or  from the second quarter of  we continue to expect  total claims paid to decline from s total claims paid of  million were also  million above the actuarial midpoint of expected ultimate claims payments for all years consistent with the first quarter and yearend  finally our fnf group investment portfolio totaled approximately  billion at june  from a regulated standpoint we have  billion in statutory reserves  billion in regulated cash and investment and  billion in secured trust deposits for a total of  billion in regulated cash and investments from an unregulated perspective we have  million of unregulated cash at fnf group as of june  there is also  million in consolidated cash and investments at black knight and servicelink and  million in cash at subsidiaries both of which are restricted by minimum working capital other regulatory requirements or to let those businesses run themselves autonomously let me now turn the call back to our operator to allow for any questions questionandanswer session operator ladies and gentlemen well now begin our questionandanswer session period our first question will come from the line of eric beardsley of goldman sachs please go ahead eric beardsley  goldman sachs  co hi thank you just want to followup on the head count reductions for may and june you mentioned that really didnt see much of an impact in the second quarter numbers i guess how should we think about the impact on the personnel line as we go into the third quarter and how much of a margin benefit might that be raymond r quirk  chief executive officer yeah this is randy as we said most of these reductions were done in the back half of the second quarter in may and june so we really did see very little impact in the second quarter with the  reductions and  on the corporate allin we see an expense reduction of over  million on an annualized basis so that should obviously start hitting in the third quarter now well also be looking at this very significant increase in refinance orders so we may have to make some staffing moves to cover that volume as we move through the third quarter somewhat offsetting those reductions but weve calculated up to about  million between  million and  million overall eric beardsley  goldman sachs  co got it i guess just on the refi point i guess what kind of impact do you think that would have on the margins is this something where youre able to get through these orders pretty quickly or are we going to have some lagged effect where you start to see some trickle into the fourth quarter as well in terms of the closings raymond r quirk  chief executive officer well if they continue at the rate they are i mean theyve really spiked up significantly in the last two weeks were up  our order volume over the back end of june so if they continue another three weeks or four weeks thats going to press nicely into the fourth quarter its going to depend to some degree on how quickly the lenders will be able to process this type of volume but it should help us a lot in the third quarter in terms of revenue and obviously closings and push into fourth quarter eric beardsley  goldman sachs  co okay great thank you operator next question will come from the line of jeremy campbell of barclays please go ahead jeremy campbell  barclays capital inc hey thanks guys just wanted to touch base on the agent premiums once again that channel grew at a much faster pace than the direct channel i know you guys spoke a little bit about how refi can drive some of the direct volumes higher but how should we think about the growth rate in premiums on yearoveryear basis between agency and direct michael j nolan  president hey jeremy this is mike as you know weve really enhanced our focus on growing the agency channel the past couple of years and in the past  months we signed closed to  new agents a little less than  last year and  in each of the first two quarters this year so i think that combined with the pretty good real estate activity in the east midwest and southeast where we have very strong agency market share is really paying a lot of dividends for us and i think weve had now four quarters of  to  growth over the prior years so hard to predict if that rate continues but we would expect agency to perform very well throughout the rest of the year and into next year really jeremy campbell  barclays capital inc got it and then just to piggyback on erics question a little bit on the first half of last year when we had a little mini refi boom you guys did not really need to staff up very much how do you think about trying to staff up for these volumes that look like theyre going to be coming and benefiting q and q raymond r quirk  chief executive officer well were going to be very cautious in staffing up as you know were very metrics driven so the staffing were going to do in the third quarter will be in a temporarytype environment because we dont know that this is going to last very long again it came up so quickly in the last two weeks we dont know if weve already peaked and it gradually declines or if it holds at this pace so were going to be very cautious very diligent and not get ourselves caught being overstaffed jeremy campbell  barclays capital inc great and then just finally with black knight doing so well on a fundamentals basis can you just update us on any of your crossselling opportunities and initiatives that you may have realized thus far whether theyre kind of tracking as youd had hoped raymond r quirk  chief executive officer well sure with the servicelink group and black knight we do have a very aggressive crossselling program in place weve identified upwards of  or  opportunities that are currently being pursued this is a relatively new program were just two months or three months into it so the results are still in the future but were pushing it hard and we believe its going to be very successful a lot of verification from one company over to the other with some mutual clients is beginning to pay off for us jeremy campbell  barclays capital inc is there any way to size that addressable market of  or  opportunities from a revenue perspective william p foley ii  chairman well i think weve got to – we just got to wait and get through this year the next six months or so and then we can give you an update on some of the types of customer wins that wed be able to achieve whether itd be in title or going to be default or flood or tax or homeowner appraisals home inspections we have got a lot of different opportunities with a lot of different lenders and all these lenders really need to do is to give us – make us one of five or one of four and there are many of these lenders that black knight has heavy influence with that were not – that the servicelink is not even penetrating so very hopeful about this initiative as randy said its early we do have a task force dedicated and the task force is following up consistently so weve got focus on it and were confident well have good news in about six months jeremy campbell  barclays capital inc great thanks a lot guys operator our next question will come from the line of bose george of kbw please go ahead bose george  keefe bruyette  woods inc hey guys good morning actually the first one just on the title margin outlook you noted the direct volume potentially picks up in q as refis pick up you also have benefit from the employee head count reductions so i mean do you think title margins could keep trending up from the levels you hit quarter raymond r quirk  chief executive officer well we were very pleased with our second quarter numbers we fully expect that we can catch that in the third quarter assuming that the commercial continues to run at the rate that it is currently which we do believe well get this additional influx as the revenue closes on the refinance side and the purchase seems to be holding were up about  yearoveryear as we moved into very early on into the third quarter but that seems to be holding so if all those three things play out the way we expect that they will we do get the benefit of these expense reductions that we had in the second quarter and again like i said were diligent on our staffing levels we should be able to match second quarter and our thinking would be that we can do a bit better bose george  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay great thanks and then actually just in the corporate segment it looks like there was a tax benefit whats the good run rate for that segments earnings going anthony j park  chief financial officer yeah bose this is tony yeah we did have a slight decline in the tax rate to about  in the second quarter that was due to some stock option exercise activity that we saw in the quarter and as you know thats now run through the tax provision a good run rate estimate for q would be  which is where we guided for q and then maybe q because we typically have some restricted stock vesting in q it probably comes down a little bit in q to about  bose george  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay great and actually just one more theres an industry source on commercial real – its called real capital analytics which i think a lot of people track and it shows a pretty decent decline in commercial volume i mean do you have a feel for why the data from that is different from what you guys and other title insurers are reporting which is commercial volumes still being reasonably good michael j nolan  president yeah this is mike i dont know that we can reconcile what real capital analytics has against some of the other outlooks but for example mba just forecast commercial in early july at a rate comparable to last year and actually growth in  and  all we can really say is that our order levels are very consistent with last year theyre basically flat yearoveryear and were still seeing a lot of good activity in the national segment weve seen some good pickup and interest in energy and some of the segments that have been kind of quiet like hospitality and retail so were still optimistic that commercial remains strong for the second half bose george  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay great thanks a lot operator our next question comes from the line of john campbell of stephens inc please go ahead john campbell  stephens inc hey guys good morning congrats on a great quarter raymond r quirk  chief executive officer thank you sir william p foley ii  chairman thanks john campbell  stephens inc just back to the commercial business you guys said that you do expect good performance in the back half i know  was a really good year it does look like the comps are easing up a little bit maybe in the back half but not trying to put too fine of a point on it but just curious about how do you guys characterize good performance is that just kind of modest growth off of last year or maybe just kind of holding that flat raymond r quirk  chief executive officer well weve been looking in the first half and it seems to be the conventional thinking that commercial is softening from a record year of  were off only slightly our field people are telling us its going to be a very strong second half so again like mike said were very optimistic some of the projections are even for better commercial in  and  so were not giving up anything yet on commercial so matching what we did in  would be real good for us but if not it will be the second best year ever william p foley ii  chairman we are finding that energy is playing a force now in the commercial market as some large energy transactions are pending a few of the metropolitan areas that youd expect to be soft such as houston are soft but there are many of the other secondary cities that are very very strong continuing to have good growth so we arent really matching up on those analytics yet john campbell  stephens inc got it thats helpful and then on the reserves tony i think you said youre  million or so above the actuary point estimate you guys are currently at the – i guess the  range i imagine youre probably booking the current book of business at closer to  at what point do you get a little bit more comfort in bringing that ratio down on the pl anthony j park  chief financial officer yeah thanks john this is tony yeah so were  million above the actuarys central estimate and weve really been there all year we were there at yearend and then again at q so were kind of treading water in a good spot though with an  million cushion so  is probably slightly higher than what we expect the current book to look like to your point and weve had a little bit of erosion or adverse development in  and  years so it just slight  numbers and id call it maybe  million of adverse development offset by  million of too much provision in the current year so at this level at – if we continue to stay where we are  is probably the right number but to the extent that  and  become nearly fully mature and then that cushion builds at all were probably going to have to take another look and maybe dial that current provision rate back john campbell  stephens inc yeah thats helpful and then last one for me just on the black knight spend just think about the dynamics there could you run us back through what the guarantee of the debt is and then maybe what prohibits you from doing that today versus maybe several quarters from now william p foley ii  chairman well the first element is the guarantee of  million of black knight debt that fnf took on as part of the acquisition of lps to ensure that lps remained investmentgrade its kind of very prohibiting prepayment penalty so its kind of an october  timeframe before we can realistically prepay that debt it does go down every month we are monitoring it the rates are working in our direction so those are all good things we also would have to go through the process of filing for spin and weve got a few complications the way black knight was acquired with our ownership interest and the thl ownership interest so we have to work our way through those things and honestly what we want to do right now is we want to really execute against this crosssell opportunity because we have a partiallyowned subsidiary – majorityowned subsidiary that is very good at crossselling and weve asked them to participate actively in our crosssell activity for servicelink and we have one other initiative that were working on that well be talking about sometime in the next few weeks if were successful in making this particular acquisition that ties into black knight and also ties into fnf it is not really outside of our strike zone relative to real estate financial services type activity so we need a little time it is an agenda item that pops up in our board meetings and weve been deferring it for the time being john campbell  stephens inc thats helpful thanks guys operator our next question will come from the line of geoffrey dunn of dowling  partners please go ahead geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc thank you good morning william p foley ii  chairman good morning geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc just on the black knightservicelink effort i kind of imagine youre talking to two very different people historically so how do you really facilitate that crosssell when youre dealing with kind of the executives on the bkfs side and probably some of the much lower on the chain from a servicelink side so how do you get the bank to receive that crosssell william p foley ii  chairman well actually geoff youve hit on one of the exact elements of this crosssell activity black knight does start as the executive suite whether the chairman the ceo the president the evp of mortgage if its a large bank but those individuals have the influence to help us down on the transaction side and thats exactly how were investing it and weve found that black knight is very very effective at the higherlevel executive – with the higherlevel executive and now were just asking them to free up some of their business thats on the title side and default side or flood some are easier than others some of the appraisal fees its pretty easy to accomplish floods easy to accomplish titles more complicated thats why i said we just need about six months just to see how those effort pans out weve had some good early success particularly with one large lender thats in the process of moving a fair amount of business just because of the black knight relationship so give us a little time geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc okay and then could you give a little color on the acquisitions i think you said you made seven agency deals im assuming in the quarter you what type of size are we talking about geography is there any common theme there raymond r quirk  chief executive officer yeah this is randy the acquisitions are geographically a little bit random we made a nice midsized title operation acquisition up in the midatlantic the northeast were doing some infilling down in the south florida with the title operation with an agent that we purchased down there and then some small infill agency operations around there tying these acquisitions together we just made a nice acquisition out in oregon over in the northwest that will fill in some areas where we didnt have a presence so we go where the opportunity is and well continue to do so we still have a few more that were looking so well keep the pipelines filled up but its really where the opportunity presents itself thats where we take it william p foley ii  chairman these acquisitions geoff are all designed to enhance market share and market penetration to take – in the traditional sense take out the redundancy in the backoffice accounting finance legal and so on and the oregon acquisition if we handle it right and do well with it had about  people when we acquired the business its going to add five or six points to our market share in the state of oregon which puts us over  market share in oregon and every time were going to accomplish something like that then were just continuing to drive our market share and become a more dominant player in the various parts of the county geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc and obviously i think all three of the major title companies have now expressed an interest in growing agency whats your experience with the valuations in the marketplace william p foley ii  chairman i mean there are still people that own agencies theyre selling those agencies or private companies as a general rule and they are pricing their businesses in that x to x ebitda range and so its very affordable and particularly once we get through activating some synergies so this is a pretty good time for us to grow our business and expand our base and to do it fairly economically geoffrey murray dunn  dowling  partners securities llc okay thank you operator and we have a question from the line of mark hughes of suntrust please go ahead mark douglas hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc yeah thank you i wonder if you could give some directional thoughts on black knight sales and ebitda margin you had a nice acceleration in q  top line is that the new baseline does the sales backlog make it look like that will be better william p foley ii  chairman well id rather have tom sanzone answer the question i guess – i thought he might actually be here well whats happening is the new sales that are occurring at black knight particularly with on the msp platform in their loansphere business are coming at very high margins because the business base – the base requirements to run the business are already in place and thats why youre seeing this ebitda margin expansion also the empower platform has been refined and updated and integrated and so now we sell empower the margins on those sales are very very high so id really have you talked to kirk about margin expansion going forward but obviously this  basis points yearoveryear is gigantic and we have a lot of – we have a very very large pipeline of large transactions particularly in empower and msp that bodes well for future margin expansion mark douglas hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc and then just a quick followup on the agency business it sounds like youre taking share there was a mix shift this quarter youre kind of lapping your jump in agency in the third quarter of last year how should we think about the potential for that elevated growth to be sustained in the back half will there be more market share gains or will that kind of moderate a bit michael j nolan  president well weve been really focused on  key states in our market share efforts and weve seen – i think in  we had pretty good market share gains in i think  of the  with the agent signings and the focus weve had continuing on those states we would expect to continue to take a little bit more market share out mark douglas hughes  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you operator our next question will come from the line of jason deleeuw of piper jaffray please go ahead jason s deleeuw  piper jaffray  co broker thank you and good work on the quarter question on the margins for the second quarter on the first quarter earnings call you had kind of tempered the outlook for the margins and then we had a surprise beat this quarter i think versus what most people are expecting on the margins so what kind of transpired during the quarter in terms of driving the better margins and then i think kind of the commentary that we had on the first quarter raymond r quirk  chief executive officer well i think as the closing shifted to the purchase side it was really a bit more significant than we thought it was going to be in the second quarter and the commercial held strong so youre correct we were pushing to get to a  or plus number and with the agency revenue coming in the way it did a lot of things came together for us and pushed us up in that mid range but i think probably what was most significant was the purchase transaction so the closings relative to purchase they built as we moved through the third quarter and we ended up with a very significant june jason s deleeuw  piper jaffray  co broker okay got it so it sounds like you had set some sort of conservatism on the margin outlook just partly on the commercial but also just kind of on the purchase trend so i mean i think is that kind of when we think going forward on the margins we did this  this quarter william p foley ii  chairman ill tell you randy sort of – you hit it right and also you have to remember that the last couple quarters had trid in there so you had extra people and every so often every couple years companies get off their game a little bit and maybe you have a few extra people that they have to take a look at and kind of tighten their belt and thats really what randy and mike and tony did after we really examined and dug into the first quarter operating results and margins and the result of that was  days later those margins popped back up more in a direction where we like to see them is that fair enough randy raymond r quirk  chief executive officer yeah it is and we knew that we were going to be working through trid in the second quarter that was our expectations all the way along and we were able to move through it more quickly the banks came in and embraced the technology our folks were all trained up for it and the real estate brokers and agents they got on board with it more quickly than we thought so i think youre exactly right trid got us a little bit confused here at the back end of the first quarter jason s deleeuw  piper jaffray  co broker all right thanks for all that and then just to remind us on the local versus national commercial margins is there a big difference between those two michael j nolan  president well so on the national offices we can measure margins very carefully and we tend to run with plus margin so thats really our highestmargin business in our distributed offices theyre working on local commercial deals residential deals resell refi so we cant really cost account and break out what the specific margin would be in a local office what we do know though is that local commercial deals are smaller and so the average fee per file is less and youd probably expect that the margin would be a little bit lower jason s deleeuw  piper jaffray  co broker okay thank you for that operator and our next question will come from the line of kevin kaczmarek of zelman  company –  associates please go ahead kevin kaczmarek  zelman  associates thanks guys for taking my questions i guess amongst the new agents that youve been acquiring is there a particular concentration in order type such as purchase and any sense of how much those deals would have added to the direct order counts that you report raymond r quirk  chief executive officer well no we dont go after it relative to what kind of a mix that they have i mean when were acquiring one of these agents which is another title company for us its typically a pretty standard mix much like we have in our own organization so we dont look at it in that regard what we do as bill had already mentioned is bring the organizations in find the synergies improve the margins and put them into our mix to increase our market share kevin kaczmarek  zelman  associates and do have a sense for how much – i guess what im trying to get at is how much of the order growth i guess including purchase and refi is kind of organic and how much has been acquired  raymond r quirk  chief executive officer well we dont have a real number for you but these acquisitions were in the back end of the second quarter and one of them just actually has taken place in the first two weeks here of the third quarter so not significant whatsoever kevin kaczmarek  zelman  associates okay all right and on the investment income it seemed a few million higher excluding the realized gains is that a good run rate going forward or is there something special anthony j park  chief financial officer no kevin this is tony thats actually a little high every second quarter we get some dividends from some investments we have in title plant thats kind of a onetime thing its not something we can accrue because we dont know the exact number but that shows up in q as it did this quarter and as it did in the second quarter of  so i would ratchet the run rate on investment income down to where weve been trending over the last four quarters kevin kaczmarek  zelman  associates okay and i guess you mentioned big acquisition or effort that youre working on with servicelink and black knight can you tell us a little bit more about that was that an acquisition or is that under fnf or will that be under black knight william p foley ii  chairman it will be under fnf but it will be – a lot of the software development activities will be handled by black knight and black knight will participate in the effort and then also expand black knights product suite if it comes together so we should have an announcement within the next few weeks if its going to happen were pretty far along with it thats about all i can say on that particular subject kevin kaczmarek  zelman  associates okay great thanks a lot thats all i had operator and our next question is a followup from the line of bose george of kbw please go ahead chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc this is actually chas tyson jumping on for bose just wanted to follow up very quickly on two items capex look like it was a little bit higher than its been running at is there any reason for why that would be a little higher this quarter anthony j park  chief financial officer yeah this is tony we had an acquisition of our corporate headquarters office in jacksonville we had an offbalance sheet synthetic lease that came due and so we had a  million purchase to buy that out of that lease arrangement the good news there is that we did not use parent company cash flow for that acquisition we were actually able to admit that within one of our regulated insurance subsidiaries so the full  million came from that and not from parent company chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay and then on the higher – i guess the deal that you had been looking at on the fnf side but its crossselling with black knight is that – i mean is there a way to think about the size the potential i mean is it kind of bigger than some of the deals that youve been – that the agency that youve acquired on a dollars basis william p foley ii  chairman wed rather wait just  for a couple weeks well have a release if it comes together and youll be hearing about it shortly if it works chas tyson  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay fair enough thanks william p foley ii  chairman thanks operator there are no further questions in queue at this time i would now like to turn the conference over to mr william foley for any closing remarks william p foley ii  chairman thank you this quarter clearly highlights the earnings power of our title insurance business as we enter the second half of  we will continue to strive to maximize earnings from our operations and remain the mostprofitable title
