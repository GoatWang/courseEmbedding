years end but it won’t fix us deficit ge cfo keith sherin fiscal cliff deal likely by years end but it won’t fix us deficit posted by adminon november  in news print email keith sherin ge general electric‘s keith sherin chief financial officer said that if congress were to solve the fiscal cliff by the end of the year the problem would not end there reuters reports speaking at an event sponsored by mit’s sloan school of management sherin said the primary responsibility of the elected officials is to manage the country’s deficit and “they’re not getting it done” “it’s in everybody’s interest to find some way to have a bipartisan solution to deal with our deficit situation which cannot continue obviously at the level they’ve been” he added “it’s going to be a combination of raising revenue and cutting longterm spending” ge refinanced a  billion bond in order to avoid any disruptions to debt markets that could result if the us economy went over the fiscal cliff and the company now holds enough cash on hand to run for more than a year without accessing capital markets sherin said sherin said he believes the congress will not be able to solve all the fiscal  problems by december but it is “highly likely” they will solve the budget problems by setting up a timetable for the long term share this story tags congressgeneral electrickeith sherinmit sloan school of

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples

may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
