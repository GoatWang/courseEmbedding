teeth on the student magazine john ogauntlet he later gained a phd in political science from trinity college dublin in  the title of his doctoral thesis was a condition of limited warfare éires neutrality and the relationship between dublin belfast and london – careeredit newspaper correspondentedit fisk worked on the sunday express diary column before a disagreement with the editor john junor prompted a move to the times from  to  at the height of the troubles fisk served as belfast correspondent for the times before becoming its correspondent in portugal covering the aftermath of the carnation revolution he then was appointed middle east correspondent – when a story of his was spiked iran air flight  after rupert murdochs takeover he moved to the independent in april  the new york times once described robert fisk as probably the most famous foreign correspondent in britain he reported the northern ireland troubles in the s the portuguese revolution in  the lebanese civil war the iranian revolution in  the soviet war in afghanistan the iran–iraq war the gulf war the bosnian war the algerian civil war the kosovo war the  international intervention in afghanistan the invasion of iraq in  the arab spring in  and the ongoing syrian civil war war reportingedit robert fisk at the al jazeera forum in  fisk has lived in beirut since  remaining throughout the lebanese civil war he was one of the first journalists to visit the scene of the sabra and shatila massacre in lebanon as well as the syrian hama massacre his book on the lebanese conflict pity the nation was first published in  fisk also reported on the arab–israeli conflict the bosnian war the kosovo war the algerian civil war among other conflicts during the iran–iraq war he suffered partial but permanent hearing loss as a result of being close to iraqi heavy artillery in the shattalarab when covering the early stages of the conflict after the united states and allies launched their intervention in afghanistan fisk was for a time transferred to pakistan to provide coverage of that conflict while reporting from there he was attacked and beaten by a group of afghan refugees fleeing heavy bombing by the united states air force he was ultimately rescued from this attack by another afghan refugee in his graphic account of his own beating fisk absolved the attackers of responsibility and pointed out that their brutality was entirely the product of others of us—of we who had armed their struggle against the russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the war for civilisation just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them collateral damage during the  invasion of iraq fisk was stationed in baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports he has criticised other journalists based in iraq for what he calls their hotel journalism literally reporting from ones hotel room without interviews or first hand experience of events his opposition to the war brought criticism from both irish sunday independent columnist and senator eoghan harris and the guardian columnist simon hoggart fisk has criticised the coalitions handling of the sectarian violence in postinvasion iraq and argued that the official narrative of sectarian conflict is not possible the real question i ask myself is who are these people who are trying to provoke the civil war now the americans will say its al qaeda its the sunni insurgents it is the death squads many of the death squads work for the ministry of interior who runs the ministry of interior in baghdad who pays the ministry of the interior who pays the militia men who make up the death squads we do the occupation authorities … we need to look at this story in a different light osama bin ladenedit fisk interviewed osama bin laden three times reporting the interviews in articles published by the independent on  december   july  and  march  in fisks first interview antisoviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace he wrote of osama bin laden with his high cheekbones narrow eyes and long brown robe mr bin laden looks every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend chadored children danced in front of him preachers acknowledged his wisdom while noting that he was accused of training for further jihad wars during one of fisks interviews with bin laden fisk noted an attempt by bin laden to convert him bin laden said mr robert one of our brothers had a dreamthat you were a spiritual person  this means you are a true muslim fisk replied sheikh osama i am not a muslim  i am a journalist whose task is to tell the truth bin laden replied if you tell the truth that means you are a good muslim during the  interview bin laden accused the saudi royal family of corruption during the final interview in  bin laden said he sought gods help to turn america into a shadow of itself fisk strongly condemned the september  attacks describing them as a hideous crime against humanity he also denounced the bush administrations response to the attacks arguing that a score of nations were being identified and positioned as haters of democracy or kernels of evil and urged a more honest debate on us policy in the middle east he argued that such a debate had hitherto been avoided because of course to look too closely at the middle east would raise disturbing questions about the region about our western policies in those tragic lands and about americas relationship with israel in  fisk expressed personal doubts about the official historical record of the attacks in an article for the independent he claimed that while the bush administration was incapable of successfully carrying out such attacks due to its organisational incompetence he is increasingly troubled at the inconsistencies in the official narrative of  and added that he does not condone the crazed research of david icke but is talking about scientific issues fisk had earlier addressed similar concerns in a speech at sydney university in  during the speech fisk said partly i think because of the culture of secrecy of the white house never have we had a white house so secret as this one partly because of this culture i think suspicions are growing in the united states not just among berkeley guys with flowers in their hair  but there are a lot of things we dont know a lot of things were not going to be told  perhaps the fourth plane was hit by a missile we still dont know recently published compilation of osama bin laden’s writings reveals how frequently he is inclined to cite western writers western diplomats and western thinkers at one point he even advises the white house to read robert fisk rather than as one might have supposed the koran viewsedit fisk has described himself as a pacifist and has never voted he has said that journalism must challenge authority all authority especially so when governments and politicians take us to war he has quoted with approval israeli journalist amira hass there is a misconception that journalists can be objective  what journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power he spoke on lies misreporting and catastrophe in the middle east at the first congregational church of berkeley on  september  and stated i think it is the duty of a foreign correspondent to be neutral and unbiased on the side of those who suffer whoever they may be he has written at length on how much of contemporary conflict has its origin in his view in lines drawn on maps after the allied victory of  at the end of my fathers war the victors divided up the lands of their former enemies in the space of just seventeen months they created the borders of northern ireland yugoslavia and most of the middle east and i have spent my entire career—in belfast and sarajevo in beirut and baghdad—watching the people within those borders

early life and educationedit fisk was an only child born in maidstone kent his father already in his mids was borough treasurer at maidstone corporation and had fought in the first world war he was educated at yardley court a preparatory school then at sutton valence school and lancaster university where he cut his journalistic teeth on the student magazine john ogauntlet he later gained a phd in political science from trinity college dublin in  the title of his doctoral thesis was a condition of limited warfare éires neutrality and the relationship between dublin belfast and london – careeredit newspaper correspondentedit fisk worked on the sunday express diary column before a disagreement with the editor john junor prompted a move to the times from  to  at the height of the troubles fisk served as belfast correspondent for the times before becoming its correspondent in portugal covering the aftermath of the carnation revolution he then was appointed middle east correspondent – when a story of his was spiked iran air flight  after rupert murdochs takeover he moved to the independent in april  the new york times once described robert fisk as probably the most famous foreign correspondent in britain he reported the northern ireland troubles in the s the portuguese revolution in  the lebanese civil war the iranian revolution in  the soviet war in afghanistan the iran–iraq war the gulf war the bosnian war the algerian civil war the kosovo war the  international intervention in afghanistan the invasion of iraq in  the arab spring in  and the ongoing syrian civil war war reportingedit robert fisk at the al jazeera forum in  fisk has lived in beirut since  remaining throughout the lebanese civil war he was one of the first journalists to visit the scene of the sabra and shatila massacre in lebanon as well as the syrian hama massacre his book on the lebanese conflict pity the nation was first published in  fisk also reported on the arab–israeli conflict the bosnian war the kosovo war the algerian civil war among other conflicts during the iran–iraq war he suffered partial but permanent hearing loss as a result of being close to iraqi heavy artillery in the shattalarab when covering the early stages of the conflict after the united states and allies launched their intervention in afghanistan fisk was for a time transferred to pakistan to provide coverage of that conflict while reporting from there he was attacked and beaten by a group of afghan refugees fleeing heavy bombing by the united states air force he was ultimately rescued from this attack by another afghan refugee in his graphic account of his own beating fisk absolved the attackers of responsibility and pointed out that their brutality was entirely the product of others of us—of we who had armed their struggle against the russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the war for civilisation just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them collateral damage during the  invasion of iraq fisk was stationed in baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports he has criticised other journalists based in iraq for what he calls their hotel journalism literally reporting from ones hotel room without interviews or first hand experience of events his opposition to the war brought criticism from both irish sunday independent columnist and senator eoghan harris and the guardian columnist simon hoggart fisk has criticised the coalitions handling of the sectarian violence in postinvasion iraq and argued that the official narrative of sectarian conflict is not possible the real question i ask myself is who are these people who are trying to provoke the civil war now the americans will say its al qaeda its the sunni insurgents it is the death squads many of the death squads work for the ministry of interior who runs the ministry of interior in baghdad who pays the ministry of the interior who pays the militia men who make up the death squads we do the occupation authorities … we need to look at this story in a different light osama bin ladenedit fisk interviewed osama bin laden three times reporting the interviews in articles published by the independent on  december   july  and  march  in fisks first interview antisoviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace he wrote of osama bin laden with his high cheekbones narrow eyes and long brown robe mr bin laden looks every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend chadored children danced in front of him preachers acknowledged his wisdom while noting that he was accused of training for further jihad wars during one of fisks interviews with bin laden fisk noted an attempt by bin laden to convert him bin laden said mr robert one of our brothers had a dreamthat you were a spiritual person  this means you are a true muslim fisk replied sheikh osama i am not a muslim  i am a journalist whose task is to tell the truth bin laden replied if you tell the truth that means you are a good muslim during the  interview bin laden accused the saudi royal family of corruption during the final interview in  bin laden said he sought gods help to turn america into a shadow of itself fisk strongly condemned the september  attacks describing them as a hideous crime against humanity he also denounced the bush administrations response to the attacks arguing that a score of nations were being identified and positioned as haters of democracy or kernels of evil and urged a more honest debate on us policy in the middle east he argued that such a debate had hitherto been avoided because of course to look too closely at the middle east would raise disturbing questions about the region about our western policies in those tragic lands and about americas relationship with israel in  fisk expressed personal doubts about the official historical record of the attacks in an article for the independent he claimed that while the bush administration was incapable of successfully carrying out such attacks due to its organisational incompetence he is increasingly troubled at the inconsistencies in the official narrative of  and added that he does not condone the crazed research of david icke but is talking about scientific issues fisk had earlier addressed similar concerns in a speech at sydney university in  during the speech fisk said partly i think because of the culture of secrecy of the white house never have we had a white house so secret as this one partly because of this culture i think suspicions are growing in the united states not just among berkeley guys with flowers in their hair  but there are a lot of things we dont know a lot of things were not going to be told  perhaps the fourth plane was hit by a missile we still dont know recently published compilation of osama bin laden’s writings reveals how frequently he is inclined to cite western writers western diplomats and western thinkers at one point he even advises the white house to read robert fisk rather than as one might have supposed the koran viewsedit fisk has described himself as a pacifist and has never voted he has said that journalism must challenge authority all authority especially so when governments and politicians take us to war he has quoted with approval israeli journalist amira hass there is a misconception that journalists can be objective  what journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power he spoke on lies misreporting and catastrophe in the middle east at the first congregational church of berkeley on  september  and stated i think it is the duty of a foreign correspondent to be neutral and unbiased on the side of those who suffer whoever they may be he has written at length on how much of contemporary conflict has its origin in his view in lines drawn on maps after the allied victory of  at the end of my fathers war the victors divided up the lands of their former enemies in the space of just seventeen months they created the borders of northern ireland yugoslavia and most of the middle east and i have spent my entire career—in belfast and sarajevo in beirut and baghdad—watching the people within those borders burn fisk has also written extensively about the armenian genocide of  and he has supported moves to persuade the turkish government to acknowledge the truth of what happened in the genocide responsesedit actor john malkovich was asked during a  appearance at the cambridge union society whom he would most like to fight to the death and he replied that he would rather just shoot journalist robert fisk and then british mp george galloway fisk reacted with outrage at the comment made by malkovich and also at his associating me with a jerk like galloway personal lifeedit he married american journalist lara marlowe in  they divorced in  fiskingedit fisking is a blogosphere slang describing a pointbypoint criticism that highlights perceived errors or disputes the analysis in a statement article or essay the term originated from various blogs which have taken particular issue with fisks views many of these bloggers have responded by reprinting his dispatches on their blogs adding their own paragraphbyparagraph commentary dissecting and claiming to debunk fisks assertions and opinions according to the guardian fisking has come to denote the practice of savaging an argument and scattering the tattered remnants to the four corners of the internet awards and

provide coverage of that conflict while reporting from there he was attacked and beaten by a group of afghan refugees fleeing heavy bombing by the united states air force he was ultimately rescued from this attack by another afghan refugee in his graphic account of his own beating fisk absolved the attackers of responsibility and pointed out that their brutality was entirely the product of others of us—of we who had armed their struggle against the russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the war for civilisation just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them collateral damage during the  invasion of iraq fisk was stationed in baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports he has criticised other journalists based in iraq for what he calls their hotel journalism literally reporting from ones hotel room without interviews or first hand experience of events his opposition to

in front of him preachers acknowledged his wisdom while noting that he was accused of training for further jihad wars during one of fisks interviews with bin laden fisk noted an attempt by bin laden to convert him bin laden said mr robert one of our brothers had a dreamthat you were a spiritual person  this means you are a true muslim fisk replied sheikh osama i am not a muslim  i am a journalist whose task is to tell the truth bin laden replied if you tell the truth that means you are a good muslim during the  interview bin laden accused the saudi royal family of corruption during the final interview in  bin laden said he sought gods help to turn america into a shadow of itself fisk strongly condemned the september  attacks describing them as a hideous crime against humanity he also denounced the bush administrations response to the attacks arguing that a score of nations were being identified and positioned as haters of democracy or kernels of evil and urged a more honest debate on us policy in the middle east he argued that such a debate had hitherto been avoided because of course to look too closely at the middle east would raise disturbing questions about the region about our western policies in those tragic lands and about americas relationship with israel in  fisk expressed personal doubts about the official historical record of the attacks in an article for the

early life and educationedit fisk was an only child born in maidstone kent his father already in his mids was borough treasurer at maidstone corporation and had fought in the first world war he was educated at yardley court a preparatory school then at sutton valence school and lancaster university where he cut his journalistic teeth on the student magazine john ogauntlet he later gained a phd in political science from trinity college dublin in  the title of his doctoral thesis was a condition of limited warfare éires neutrality and the relationship between dublin belfast and london – careeredit newspaper correspondentedit fisk worked on the sunday express diary column before a disagreement with the editor john junor prompted a move to the times from  to  at the height of the troubles fisk served as belfast correspondent for the times before becoming its correspondent in portugal covering the aftermath of the carnation revolution he then was appointed middle east correspondent – when a story of his was spiked iran air flight  after rupert murdochs takeover he moved to the independent in april  the new york times once described robert fisk as probably the most famous foreign correspondent in britain he reported the northern ireland troubles in the s the portuguese revolution in  the lebanese civil war the iranian revolution in  the soviet war in afghanistan the iran–iraq war the gulf war the bosnian war the algerian civil war the kosovo war the  international intervention in afghanistan the invasion of iraq in  the arab spring in  and the ongoing syrian civil war war reportingedit robert fisk at the al jazeera forum in  fisk has lived in beirut since  remaining throughout the lebanese civil war he was one of the first journalists to visit the scene of the sabra and shatila massacre in lebanon as well as the syrian hama massacre his book on the lebanese conflict pity the nation was first published in  fisk also reported on the arab–israeli conflict the bosnian war the kosovo war the algerian civil war among other conflicts during the iran–iraq war he suffered partial but permanent hearing loss as a result of being close to iraqi heavy artillery in the shattalarab when covering the early stages of the conflict after the united states and allies launched their intervention in afghanistan fisk was for a time transferred to pakistan to provide coverage of that conflict while reporting from there he was attacked and beaten by a group of afghan refugees fleeing heavy bombing by the united states air force he was ultimately rescued from this attack by another afghan refugee in his graphic account of his own beating fisk absolved the attackers of responsibility and pointed out that their brutality was entirely the product of others of us—of we who had armed their struggle against the russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the war for civilisation just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them collateral damage during the  invasion of iraq fisk was stationed in baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports he has criticised other journalists based in iraq for what he calls their hotel journalism literally reporting from ones hotel room without interviews or first hand experience of events his opposition to the war brought criticism from both irish sunday independent columnist and senator eoghan harris and the guardian columnist simon hoggart fisk has criticised the coalitions handling of the sectarian violence in postinvasion iraq and argued that the official narrative of sectarian conflict is not possible the real question i ask myself is who are these people who are trying to provoke the civil war now the americans will say its al qaeda its the sunni insurgents it is the death squads many of the death squads work for the ministry of interior who runs the ministry of interior in baghdad who pays the ministry of the interior who pays the militia men who make up the death squads we do the occupation authorities … we need to look at this story in a different light osama bin ladenedit fisk interviewed osama bin laden three times reporting the interviews in articles published by the independent on  december   july  and  march  in fisks first interview antisoviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace he wrote of osama bin laden with his high cheekbones narrow eyes and long brown robe mr bin laden looks every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend chadored children danced in front of him preachers acknowledged his wisdom while noting that he was accused of training for further jihad wars during one of fisks interviews with bin laden fisk noted an attempt by bin laden to convert him bin laden said mr robert one of our brothers had a dreamthat you were a spiritual person  this means you are a true muslim fisk replied sheikh osama i am not a muslim  i am a journalist whose task is to tell the truth bin laden replied if you tell the truth that means you are a good muslim during the  interview bin laden accused the saudi royal family of corruption during the final interview in  bin laden said he sought gods help to turn america into a shadow of itself fisk strongly condemned the september  attacks describing them as a hideous crime against humanity he also denounced the bush administrations response to the attacks arguing that a score of nations were being identified and positioned as haters of democracy or kernels of evil and urged a more honest debate on us policy in the middle east he argued that such a debate had hitherto been avoided because of course to look too closely at the middle east would raise disturbing questions about the region about our western policies in those tragic lands and about americas relationship with israel in  fisk expressed personal doubts about the official historical record of the attacks in an article for the independent he claimed that while the bush administration was incapable of successfully carrying out such attacks due to its organisational incompetence he is increasingly troubled at the inconsistencies in the official narrative of  and added that he does not condone the crazed research of david icke but is talking about scientific issues fisk had earlier addressed similar concerns in a speech at sydney university in  during the speech fisk said partly i think because of the culture of secrecy of the white house never have we had a white house so secret as this one partly because of this culture i think suspicions are growing in the united states not just among berkeley guys with flowers in their hair  but there are a lot of things we dont know a lot of things were not going to be told  perhaps the fourth plane was hit by a missile we still dont know recently published compilation of osama bin laden’s writings reveals how frequently he is inclined to cite western writers western diplomats and western thinkers at one point he even advises the white house to read robert fisk rather than as one might have supposed the koran viewsedit fisk has described himself as a pacifist and has never voted he has said that journalism must challenge authority all authority especially so when governments and politicians take us to war he has quoted with approval israeli journalist amira hass there is a misconception that journalists can be objective  what journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power he spoke on lies misreporting and catastrophe in the middle east at the first congregational church of berkeley on  september  and stated i think it is the duty of a foreign correspondent to be neutral and unbiased on the side of those who suffer whoever they may be he has written at length on how much of contemporary conflict has its origin in his view in lines drawn on maps after the allied victory of  at the end of my fathers war the victors divided up the lands of their former enemies in the space of just seventeen months they created the borders of northern ireland yugoslavia and most of the middle east and i

correspondent – when a story of his was spiked iran air flight  after rupert murdochs takeover he moved to the independent in april  the new york times once described robert fisk as probably the most famous foreign correspondent in britain he reported the northern ireland troubles in the s the portuguese revolution in  the lebanese civil war the iranian revolution in  the soviet war in afghanistan the iran–iraq war the gulf war the bosnian war the algerian civil war the kosovo war the  international intervention in afghanistan the invasion of iraq in  the arab spring in  and the ongoing syrian civil war war reportingedit robert fisk at the al jazeera forum in  fisk has lived in beirut since  remaining throughout the lebanese civil war he was one of the first journalists to visit the scene of the sabra and shatila massacre in lebanon as well as the syrian hama massacre his book on the lebanese conflict pity the nation was first published in  fisk also reported on the arab–israeli conflict the bosnian war the kosovo war the algerian civil war among other conflicts during the iran–iraq war he suffered partial but permanent hearing loss as a result of being close to iraqi heavy artillery in the shattalarab when covering the early stages of the conflict after the united states and allies launched their intervention in afghanistan fisk was for a time transferred to pakistan to provide coverage of that conflict while reporting from there he was attacked and beaten by a group of afghan refugees fleeing heavy bombing by the united states air force he was ultimately rescued from this attack by another afghan refugee in his graphic account of his own beating fisk absolved the attackers of responsibility and pointed out that their brutality was entirely the product of others of us—of we who had armed their struggle against the russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the war for civilisation just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them collateral damage during the  invasion of iraq fisk was stationed in baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports he has criticised other journalists based in iraq for what he calls their hotel journalism literally reporting from ones hotel room without interviews or first hand experience of events his opposition to the war brought criticism from both irish sunday independent columnist and senator eoghan harris and the guardian columnist simon hoggart fisk has criticised the coalitions handling of the sectarian violence in postinvasion iraq and argued that the official narrative of sectarian conflict is not possible the real question i ask myself is who are these people who are trying to provoke the civil war now the americans will say its al qaeda its the sunni insurgents it is the death squads many of the death squads work for the ministry of interior who runs the ministry of interior in baghdad who pays the ministry of the interior who pays the militia men who make up the death squads we do the occupation authorities … we need to look at this story in a different light osama bin ladenedit fisk interviewed osama bin laden three times reporting the interviews in articles published by the independent on  december   july  and  march  in fisks first interview antisoviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace he wrote of osama bin laden with his high cheekbones narrow eyes and long brown robe mr bin laden looks every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend chadored children danced in front of him preachers acknowledged his wisdom while noting that he was accused of training for further jihad wars during one of fisks interviews with bin laden fisk noted an attempt by bin laden to convert him bin laden said mr robert one of our brothers had a dreamthat you were a spiritual person  this means you are a true muslim fisk replied sheikh osama i am not a muslim  i am a journalist whose task is to tell the truth bin laden replied if you tell the truth that means you are a good muslim during the  interview bin laden accused the saudi royal family of corruption during the final interview in  bin laden said he sought gods help to turn america into a shadow of itself fisk strongly condemned the september  attacks describing them as a hideous crime against humanity he also denounced the bush administrations response to the attacks arguing that a score of nations were being identified and positioned as haters of democracy or kernels of evil and urged a more honest debate on us policy in the middle east he argued that such a debate had hitherto been avoided because of course to look too closely at the middle east would raise disturbing questions about the region about our western policies in those tragic lands and about americas relationship with israel in  fisk expressed personal doubts about the official historical record of the attacks in an article for the independent he claimed that while the bush administration was incapable of successfully carrying out such attacks due to its organisational incompetence he is increasingly troubled at the inconsistencies in the official narrative of  and added that he does not condone the crazed research of david icke but is talking about scientific issues fisk had earlier addressed similar concerns in a speech at sydney university in  during the speech fisk said partly i think because of the culture of secrecy of the white house never have we had a white house so secret as this one partly because of this culture i think suspicions are growing in the united states not just among berkeley guys with flowers in their hair  but there are a lot of things we dont know a lot of things were not going to be told  perhaps the fourth plane was hit by a missile we still dont know recently published compilation of osama bin laden’s writings reveals how frequently he is inclined to cite western writers western diplomats and western thinkers at one point he even advises the white house to read robert fisk rather than as one might have supposed the koran viewsedit fisk has described himself as a pacifist and has never voted he has said that journalism must challenge authority all authority especially so when governments and politicians take us to war he has quoted with approval israeli journalist amira hass there is a misconception that journalists can be objective  what journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power he spoke on lies misreporting and catastrophe in the middle east at the first congregational church of berkeley on  september  and stated i think it is the duty of a foreign correspondent to be neutral and unbiased on the side of those who suffer whoever they may be he has written at length on how much of contemporary conflict has its origin in his view in lines drawn on maps after the allied victory of  at the end of my fathers war the victors divided up the lands of their former enemies in the space of just seventeen months they created the borders of northern ireland yugoslavia and most of the middle east and i have spent my entire career—in belfast and sarajevo in beirut and baghdad—watching the people within those borders burn fisk has also written extensively about the armenian genocide of  and he has supported moves to persuade the turkish government to acknowledge the truth of what happened in the genocide responsesedit actor john malkovich was asked during a  appearance at the cambridge union society whom he would most like to fight to the death and he replied that he would rather just shoot journalist robert fisk and then british mp george galloway fisk reacted with outrage at the comment made by malkovich and also at his associating me with a jerk like galloway personal lifeedit he married american journalist lara marlowe in  they divorced in  fiskingedit fisking is a blogosphere
