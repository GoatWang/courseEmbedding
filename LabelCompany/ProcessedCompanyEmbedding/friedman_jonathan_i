qty add to cart people have been asking questions about god since the dawn of humankind—and humanitys disagreements about the nature of god have often led to ethnic and religious warfare the suppression of women and the debasing of human dignity many religions have created rituals and dogmas that separate one from the other and cling to the belief that only they have the one truth but are any of them actually right can the true essence of god ever truly be understood or explained igod traces how the various belief systems about god have evolved into what exists in the present day and then delves into the many questions about god that so many people have asked throughout history perhaps through this exploration we can finally begin to understand what god really is what god wants

editor thesis advisor author of introduction other opponent classifications gn  publication timeline  most widely held works by jonathan friedman cultural identity and global process by jonathan friedman book  editions published between  and  in  languages and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide examining ideas ranging from world systems theory to postmodernism jonathan friedman investigates the relations between the global and the local to show how cultural fragmentation and modernist homogenization are equally constitutive trends of global reality with examples taken from a rich variety of theoretical sources ethnographic accounts and historical eras the analysis ranges across the cultural formations of ancient greece contemporary processes of hawaiian cultural identification and congolese beauty cults throughout the author examines the interdependency of the world market and local cultural transformations and demonstrates the complex interrelations between globally structured social processes and the organization of identity jonathan friedman also documents the development and significance of a global perspective in an anthropology that illuminates a wide variety of domains from prehistory to world hegemony in so doing he interrogates the emergence of the concept of culture and suggests that anthropology itself is best understood within the trajectory of modernityjacket modernity and identity by scott lash book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide modernity and identity is a collective work which announces a radical new departure within contemporary debates on modernism and postmodernism while dominant conceptions of both modernism and postmodernism are centred around notions of stasis and fixity for most of the otherwise quite diverse writers in this book modernity is a matter of movement or flux or change and of unpredictability modernity and postmodernity are shown to mean not the end of the subject but instead the transformation and creation of new forms of subjectivity anthropological concepts are brought squarely into the heart of the modernity controversies which are then recast in the context of tradition of globalization and of the crises of identity in a newly decentred world system the book opens up the possibility of a third way rejecting the opposition between the impersonal rationality of high modernism and the irrationalist antiethics of postmodernism the vision in this book is that of another modernity which counterposes baudelaire to rousseau and localist ethics to abstract bluebrints for social and political reorganization globalization the state and violence book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide a dozen essays by us and european urbanists anthropologists sociologists and political scientists develop an approach to understanding the increasing violence that has occurred on a global scale over the past couple decades and try to construct a more adequate comprehension of global processes than has been provided in the language of globalization among the topics are class projects social consciousness and the contradictions of globalization and the case for citizenship as social contract modernities class and the contradictions of globalization  the anthropology of global systems by kajsa ekholm friedman book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide modernities class and the contradictions of the globalization presents an anthropological perspective on the various strains and disruptions caused by modern global systems consumption and identity by jonathan friedman book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this study is an attempt to locate the practice of consumption within more general strategies of social selfdefinition the essays in this volume are addressed to the understanding of consumption in terms of a larger matrix of social identity and the cultural strategies connected with it the present volume focuses upon the relation between consumption and culturally specific strategies for selfdefinition both on an individual and a group basis many of the essays are explicit attempts to deal with the complex articulation of modern commodities and nonmodern modes of appropriation the papers reflect and engage recent developments in anthropology such as the growing interest in personhood expressed in the numerous works of cultural psychology and an increasing emphasis on the reenvisioning of culture as continually constructed in socially differentiated practice as such these papers deal with consumption as part of the practice of social identity and the construction of culturally specific forms of life historical transformations  the anthropology of global systems by kajsa

watch estimates that  million civilians around the globe have lost their lives as a result of genocide in only the past sixty years over the same period the visual arts in the form of documentary

held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the lion and the star not only offers an informed glimpse into the intricacies of daily german life but also confirms the continuing danger of making sweeping generalizations about german jews and nonjews in the aftermath of world war ii many viewed the third reich as an aberration in german history and laid blame with hitler and his followers
