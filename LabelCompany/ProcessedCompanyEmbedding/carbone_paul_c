for dunkin brands we will be referring to our results and guidance targets on both a week and week basis now ill turn the call over to nigel travis nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc stacey thank you very much and good morning everyone and thank you for joining todays call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year  results  was a year of significant achievements for the full year our franchisees added  dunkin donuts restaurants in the us excluding the closure of  selfserve coffee stations in speedway locations we grew dunkin donuts us comp store sales by  and achieved our goals of  revenue growth and  adjusted operating income growth and exceeded our adjusted earnings per share target or the guidance we gave which came in at  adjusted eps growth and thats all on a week basis before we get further into our results id like to take a moment to thank paul twohig who as stacey said retires at the end of next month id like to thank him for his leadership his remarkable ability to coach people and of course for everything hes done for the company over the past seven years among his many noteworthy accomplishments while at dunkin has been his impact on global restaurant growth since he joined the company in  our franchisees and licensees have added nearly  net restaurants around the world for both brands including more than  net new dunkin donuts restaurants here in the us alone we are truly a development machine thanks in large part to pauls hard work paul we have greatly benefited from your wisdom and insight and wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors and now the responsibility for dunkin us passes over to dave hoffmann who comes to us with a worldclass résumé and have spent the past few months digging in to our business working in restaurants where im told is actually quite good meeting the franchisees and understanding our customers he is making a real difference with his candid and collaborative style with the franchisees his areas of focus are targeted towards strengthening our core business and thats optimizing our more than  drivethru restaurants simplifying the menu to improve the guest experience and expanding our value platform now back to q of fiscal  as you know weve undertaken the implementation of a sixpart plan to fuel dunkins strategic growth in the us and better position us as the beverageled onthego brand as a reminder that plan includes building our coffee culture faster and improved product innovation targeted value and smart pricing being a leader in digital improving the restaurant experience and driving consumer packaged goods and new channels we have a great deal of confidence in this plan particularly because it is rooted in the research weve conducted with  consumers crew members franchisees and employees as i look back on  i would sum it up as a year of accomplishments but – and this is important – we still have not unleashed the full potential of dunkin donuts in the us and i believe we will we know our brand can deliver more growth our consumer research clearly indicates that if we focus our efforts we are capable of being the most beloved beverageled onthego brand in the country not only does our consumer research tell us this but the results of the dd perks loyalty program clearly demonstrates our growth potential in  dunkin donuts perks members who have been in the program for at least a year and made purchases in both q  and q  and we always talk about this group as our comp members that group increased their average weekly spend by  yearoveryear this included more than a couple of  basis points in traffic growth i recognize that most of these are our loyal fans but i see this as an indication of the impressive growth we can drive where we get guests into our digital ecosystem to that end im pleased to announce that we have now surpassed  million dd perks members with this group making up more than  of transactions in q during the quarter we held our firstever perks week promotion in november a week that was dedicated to appreciating and celebrating our most loyal guests with daily deals and special prizes and which really drove membership we also launched onthego ordering nationally in june a huge operational and system accomplishment particularly in a franchise system as a reminder onthego is an offering reserved for our dunkin perks members and enables them to order ahead and speak to the front of the line in store it really is a compelling benefit of perks membership and in the fourth quarter onthego made up more than  of transactions hitting a record high of  of transactions during perks week not surprisingly the majority of onthego ordering takes place in the morning hours and importantly our data shows that onthego guest visit nearly  more than a typical guest and were just in the early days of onthego ordering imagine the power this offering can have if we grow it exponentially as a percent of sales yearoveryear it does remind me of my days in the pizza industry when online ordering as a percent of sales was in the midsingle digits and today major chains are greater than  onthego gives us the power to drive customer loyalty and the power to drive efficiency and speed of service in our restaurants so were not stopping with onthego ordering were constantly innovating to make it easier than ever for guests to get their dunkin fix for example at the end of  we launched a curbside pickup test at a store in massachusetts if you place an onthego order using the dunkin mobile app one of the options for picking it up at that store is curbside we think this could be particularly powerful for locations where drivethrus arent feasible or where the drivethru is busy in the morning we plan to expand this test in the first half of  and already were getting many franchise requests although were talking about digital lets not forget the backbone of our digital ecosystem and thats the dd card we are close to  billion in systemwide sales using the dunkin donuts card in  with more than half of that on a mobile device since last year we have grown mobile payments by nearly  the more we can get customers using a dd card then enroll them as perks members and then get them hooked on the convenience by our onthego platform the easier it is to keep them from straying to the competition this will contribute to our speed of service a key differentiator against the competition and flow through to comp growth and with that store level profitability now lets shift our focus to the q comparable store sales performance for the quarter we delivered a  in the fourth quarter ticket was probably  basis points and traffic was negative  basis points let me break down that ticket number in q ticket was comprised of approximately  basis points of price in addition to nearly  basis points attributable to less discounting yearoveryear the decrease in discounting was approximately half from the elimination of combo meals on our menu boards which of course were rolling over at the end of february this year and the other half came from having fewer discounted offers in  versus  for the fullyear pricing was about  basis points of which  basis points was from actual menu board pricing this was down from more than  basis points in menu board pricing taken in the prior year in an environment of rising labor costs it would have been easy for franchisees to continue to take price but over the past year weve allocated resources to working with franchisees on what we call smart pricing and talking to them about the impact of price increases and as a result of this and of course our strong relationships they took price more conservatively than they did in the prior year this is a big win for the quarter  again performed well driving both iced coffee and total coffee sales as in q our media in q was largely dedicated to beverages with little resource outside of store pop dedicated to food yet we were still able to grow breakfast sandwiches and donut sales proven that by leading with beverages and thats the key leading with beverages our guest will buy food once theyre in the restaurant offsetting the growth of beverages on food were continued declines in restaurant kcups sales for  and beyond were focused on building a portfolio of categoryleading beverages along with complementary and craveable food and bakery offerings while of course improving the guest experience yet as we continue to innovate we are simultaneously focusing on simplifying our menu by removing some of the complexities that have built up over the years we want to get a little leaner to run faster later this month we will begin testing a streamlined menu particularly on the food side in  stores across a variety of markets franchisees are really excited by this test and we expect it to drive a number of benefits in the restaurants and those benefits include number one improved throughput and accuracy as we reduce the complexity of the menu secondly superior service through better execution of the basics required to run the restaurant reduced food cost for our franchisee as we remove some of the lowermoving skus less turnover in our franchisees employee base as we make dunkin an easier place at which to work and the last benefit is ultimately stronger restaurant level sales as we focus our marketing spend and operations activity on core big ideas now of course youre going to have many questions on this test and once we and our franchisees have had the time to study the consumer reaction we will share additional details with this group lastly for dunkin id like to cover the launch of our readytodrink bottled iced coffee which is being manufactured distributed and sold by the cocacola company along with bottling partners nationwide in january dunkin bottled iced coffee began arriving at grocery chains gas drug and convenience stores nationally and then dunkin donuts restaurants i must say the response on social media in houston during the super bowl where we did extensive sampling and other channels has been strong and we are very excited about the opportunity for sales in our restaurants and retail not only does our entry into the readytodrink category advance our goal of being a more beveragefocused brand it will result in more people drinking dunkin donuts coffee every day let me take you through the numbers by the end of  we expect to deliver nearly  billion cups of coffee through thousands of locations in addition to our restaurants with dunkin kcups bagged coffee and now readytodrink bottled iced coffee add to that the almost  billion cups of coffee our franchisees and licensees will sell in their restaurants around the world this year for a total of nearly  billion cups globally in  so continuing to expand our cpg product portfolio and exploring the other new sales channels is a critical piece of our strategic growth plan for dunkin us and as an added benefit our franchisees share in the profits from cpg in summary as i have repeatedly said our work to transform ourselves into a beverageled onthego brand will not happen overnight theres going to be ups and downs in our performance as we work to best position the brand for longterm growth moving to baskinrobbins us we had a  comp decline for the quarter from a category perspective cups and cones had a strong performance driven equally by scoops and the new warm cookie sandwich platform dessert sales were also up driven by the new polar pizza platform that launched earlier this year and increases in online ordering we remain excited about the performance of the brand and optimistic about its growth trajectory we will continue to focus on meeting customer needs for convenience with expanded digital channels innovative and highquality products and on improving shop operations as for our international business ive just returned from asia where amongst other things i attended the opening of our newest restaurant in beijing marking our th dunkin donuts restaurant in china i was encouraged to see the progress and engagement of our international franchisees and licensees there however with both brands we continue to experience negative comps in several key international markets with discretionary spending by consumers coming under pressure as a result of several factors including sluggish local economies and currency devaluation baskinrobbins posted positive comp sales led by a strong quarter in japan that was pleasing news and dunkin donuts posted negative comp sales due to poor performance in south korea europe and the middle east on the positive side were seeing stronger performance in some of our newer markets and our international franchisees are focused on value offerings product innovation and digital technologies to make our brands more convenient we all know that international needs to perform better and the team is highly engaged in making this happen before i hand it over to paul carbone as i complete my eighth year here at dunkin i think its appropriate to look back and reiterate some of the key fundamentals that make our business really attractive one our assetlight model produces highly predictable results and industryleading adjusted operating income margin id like to remind you that in  our operating income margin is nearly  which is further strengthened by us now being  franchised in the us so weve continued to focus on the assetlight model secondly as we explained last quarter we have strong franchisee restaurant level returns driven by our highly ritualistic highmargin coffee and beverage offerings thirdly we are a growth machine just in the us alone on an average year we produce  more jobs being a growth machine we have significant white space remaining in the usa and of course overseas fourthly we have developed a fastgrowing new revenue source in consumer products and were excited about that and finally and probably most importantly we have a leadership team that is focused every day on improving our business and most of all we have a clear strategic roadmap for dunkin donuts us that gives us great confidence in the future in short ladies and gentlemen i feel good about where were heading as a business and with that ill hand over to my friend mr carbone paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc thanks nigel and good morning everyone let me start with our store development results for q and the full year in the fourth quarter dunkin donuts us franchisees opened up  net new restaurants excluding two speedway closures versus  net new units last year excluding  speedway closures for the quarter by region  of net development was in the core  in established markets  in emerging and  in the west those percentages are all excluding the speedway closures for the fullyear dunkin donuts us franchisees opened  net new restaurants excluding  speedway closures versus  net new units last year excluding the  speedway closures for the year by region  of net development was in the core  in established markets  in emerging and  in the west and again those percentages are all excluding speedway closures in the fourth quarter baskinrobbins us has  net store openings versus  net store openings last year and for the fullyear baskinrobbins us had nine net new openings versus no net restaurant openings last year baskinrobbins international has  net store openings versus  net store closures last year and dunkin donuts international had  net store openings versus  net store openings in q of the prior year for the fullyear baskinrobbins international had  net store openings versus  net store openings last year and dunkin donuts international had  net store openings versus  net store openings in the prior year in total on a global basis for both brands our franchisees and licensees opened up  net new restaurants excluding the  speedway closure in dunkin us around the world in  versus  excluding the  speedway closures in  now let me turn to the pl revenues for the fourth quarter increased  million or  compared to the prior year period due primarily to the increase in royalty income driven by the extra week in the current period as well as an increase in franchise fees due to additional renewal income these increases in revenue were offset by a decrease in sales at company operated restaurants driven by a net decrease in the number of companyoperated restaurants all remaining company operated points of distribution were sold during the fourth quarter revenues for the fourth quarter increased  on a week basis operating income and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter increased  million or  and  million or  respectively from the prior year period primarily as a result of the increases in royalty income and franchise fees as well as gains recognized in connection with the sale of companyoperated restaurants offset by an increase in ga expense additionally operating income in the prior period was unfavorably impacted by an impairment of our japan joint venture operating income and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter increased nearly  and  respectively from the prior year period on a week basis net income for the fourth quarter increased by  million to  million and adjusted net income increased  million or  to  million compared to the prioryear period primarily as a result of the increases in operating income and adjusted operating income of  million and  million respectively offset by increases in income tax expense and interest expense diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased by  to  and diluted adjusted earnings per share increased  or  to  compared to the prioryear period as a result of the increases in net income and adjusted net income respectively as well as the decrease in shares outstanding the decrease in shares outstanding from the prioryear period was due primarily to the repurchase of shares since the fourth quarter of  offset by the exercise of stock options during the fourth quarter of this year we repurchased

you our first question comes from the line of john ivankoe with jpmorgan your line is open john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc excuse me hi thank you very much two questions if i may firstly in terms of testing the streamlined menu obviously it sounds like its very significant nigel i know you said you would get a lot of questions and i think you will obviously the brand has been built on choice its been built on variety its been built on customization really something much more than what the brand was  years ago so how significant is the streamlined menu and if its possible for you to quantify in terms of the items that youre thinking about taking off the menu what percentage of sales those particular items represent nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so thats your first question is it john john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc yes my second question will be on us unit development completely separate things nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay all right so obviously you say this is a significant test and this came out of the consumer work we did last year and as i said in the remarks basically on the food side we havent started that test yet we recognized if you said there will be a lot of questions theres going to be variants of it its going to be very closely managed well be obviously looking at food items in both the morning and the afternoon i think my remarks in many ways covered it we are in the process of trying to declutter what has been cluttered outside for many years so this is a process dave is coming in hes all over it hes been working with the franchisees so im going to pass out to him because i know hes kind of excited about the opportunities from this dave david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah thanks nigel john this is all part of my focus on strengthening the core as you know this isnt unique to dunkin i think this is common in other players within the industry complexity creeps in and then you have to attack it but this effort is all around reducing complexity to produce better throughput and accuracy improve employee satisfaction reduce labor improve food costs all of those things that nigel that pointed out all with the aim of delivering a better guest experience so more to come on that were not going to go into specifics around sales at this point but again this is all our focus around strengthening the core right now john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc yeah and certainly the question was are we talking about items that are  of sales  of sales  of sales theres obviously a big spectrum of possibilities here and i just wanted to see if you could help us nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so chris fuqua the management of this  daytoday so chris chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yeah john so i think its a good question well obviously give more details in the future were looking at lower moving skus so we have a lot of products in our stores that move much slower than some of our core categories we think removing some of those skus will let our core categories grow even more john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc okay i wont press that anymore and then secondly on development obviously very symbolic that  is less than  so i wanted you to kind of elaborate on that and as we kind of think about that trend of development is  the socalled slow mile that weve talked about before nigel do you expect acceleration from these levels or is this the right level of absolute unit openings longer term or do you think that the trend actually begins to come slope down from here as we get into  and  nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc paul is going to start paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc yeah good morning john so as we look at  i think we said approximately  as a prudent number we are – its in our  to  longterm growth certainly to the lower end but in that range as we have talked about we think its a prudent number i think there are several factors top line has been below both our expectations and franchisees expectations certainly rising costs the returns while still – as we talked about the  cohort  to  below historical so – and then theres a lot of uncertainties out there with minimum wage et cetera so i think its a prudent number i think that as you look in the future we continue to believe were in the  to  and it can grow from there but we are taking again and i use that word deliberately a prudent approach to  were letting dave and his team do his work on executing the strategy as dave has said to us many times were done thinking about this now its time to put this plan and execute so we feel like its the right level of development at this point in time and do expect it to grow over time john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc next question please thanks john next question please operator our next question comes from the line of david palmer with rbc capital markets your line is open zachary schwartzman  rbc capital markets llc hey this is zachary schwartzman in for dave do you have quarterly cadence in sales or earnings that is worth pulling out at this point in particular your expectation to be up low single digit dunkin us same store sales in first quarter and does this guidance include the potential impact of the few rationalization that youre testing paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc yeah so let me take that so first we dont guide quarterly so the low single digit comps as a full year and as we go quartertoquarter part of it is what happened last year and youll get a twoyear stack but we dont guide quarterly and then to your second question its a great question so the test that were doing is about  stores so we dont expect those  stores on a fleet of call it nearly  whatever happens in that test to impact our comps on a full company or said differently our comp guidance incorporates anything that might happen in that test zachary schwartzman  rbc capital markets llc okay that makes sense thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc great thanks zachary next question please operator our next question comes from the line of john glass with morgan stanley your line is open unknown speaker hi good morning its chris  on for john so i wanted to ask about the smart pricing program if theres any additional color you could provide on that that would be helpful and then secondly just how generally the acceptance of the recommendations so far informs your view on the comp guide for  nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so ill kick off and then pass it over to chris  manage this firstly as ive said this is a huge win im really pleased with the progress weve made on this the work is unbelievably sophisticated and well done and its being communicated around the country chris will give you the details but franchise – the second thing is the franchise understanding and acceptance is and i want to make this clear beyond what i was expecting chris chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yeah thanks for the question so we basically have a swot team of people that weve put in place to concentrate fully on pricing they go out and they work with our ad committee level franchisees on understanding how to make pricing recommendations across all of our categories so rather than doing blanket recommendations like we may have done in the past five years ago or so today were doing specific category recommendations we dont guide on what pricing is going to be overall for our comp guidance in the year but i think we have a much better idea about where we think our franchisees will go in the future and we can really help make them more targeted specific recommendations so im much more confident in it weve worked with some external partners on building the database and were going to continue to get more sophisticated on this so its something that actually becomes a differentiator for us nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc yeah and ill just add one point this has been so successful weve now been doing the same thing on the baskinrobbins side as well unknown speaker thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc thanks chris  next question please operator our next question comes from the line of andy barish with jefferies your line is open andrew marc barish  jefferies llc hey guys good morning just wondering on the full year earnings guide below sort of your operating income growth targets and below consensus out there what are the thought processes behind the  earnings guide at this point paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc yes so let me start with the second half of that question so below consensus – obviously those are your numbers not ours but if you look at consensus i think its all share count so as we go into the year the way we think about this is we are going to guide on flat share count so to offset dilution we dont really have additional buybacks in our guide and that happens as we go throughout the year if it does or it does not we update with that so i think thats – if you add back – if you come back to the  million shares i think you get really close to our consensus we get really close to our guide and then just – is  below our longterm yes it is but the op income and eps growth is kind of the output of everything else so lowsingle digits in dunkin us thats below our longterm guide of comps so this is again a year we want to get to reset our core as dave talked about to accelerate comps into the future development inside our longterm guidance of  to  but to the low end so again being prudent so as i think about the op income and the eps growth thats kind of the outcome of the business metrics and on the consensus side its a share count – mainly a share count disconnect i guess between the  million that we are guiding to and whats in consensus andrew marc barish  jefferies llc okay and then just quickly on the gain in the fourth quarter on the companyowned restaurant sales what was that approximately paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc so that was on the pl its about  million for the quarter and i am happy to report as i said in the script we are no longer in the companyowned store business andrew marc barish  jefferies llc thank you very much paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc great thanks andy next question please operator our next question comes from the line of jason west with credit suisse your line is open jason west  credit suisse securities usa llc yeah thanks just going back to the comments on the cpg business i believe nigel you kind of pointed out that the amount of cups being sold there is somewhat equivalent to the retail business but the visibility we get on those cups is pretty low so i dont know if you could share any just big picture thoughts on the profitability kind of per cup or sort of how to think about the value of a cup sold at cpg versus at your retail stores and if theres ever going to be a little more disclosure on some of these agreements you guys have on the cpg side of things paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc yeah so let me take that this is paul again so certainly i would say a cup of coffee sold in the restaurant is going to be the most profitable for both the franchisee and for dunkin brands we are a restaurant company above all else we believe in cpg we believe in driving people between cpg and the restaurant but in the end and we will always be a restaurant company first so that is where we will make the bulk of our revenue and our profit as far as disclosing the agreements i dont think were going to disclose further on the agreements but i will tell you this past year if you look at other revenue where all the cpg revenue goes we ended the year approximately  million most of that is cpg and we expect that to grow mid to high single digit next year with kcup growth and the introduction of rtd which were very very excited about and were going to continue to grow that business with new product introductions et cetera nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so i think ill just add one point or two points one is this is a business that in many ways is relatively new to us so we see opportunities as we go along i think our partners have done a good job but were always pushing them to do even more get more skus get more placings  in supermarkets for example i think online continues to be an opportunity that we need to grow if we then talk about the yield which as paul said were not going to go into the agreements one of the things that i think were pretty good at is managing pls and down the road we see opportunities to improve it and remember every time we improve it its not just good for dunkin brands its good for our franchisees as well which is the great thing of our sharing relationship so id sum it all up were excited we see opportunities and paul and the team are doing a great job pushing this business paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc great thanks jason next question please operator our next question comes from the line of matthew difrisco with guggenheim your line is open matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thank you my question is with respect to the streamlining of the menu and that store test i was curious also does that have a meaningful impact on potentially reducing the investment cost have you set out a target to reduce that investment cost i know a couple of maybe it was analyst day or a couple of quarters ago on one of the calls you mentioned that some of the west coast returns and development were a little bit hampered by the initial stores that you went into the bared  higher investment cost i wondered if this streamlining also might help and address some of that that could lead to maybe even stabilization or resumption of faster growth in those markets nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so theres a lot rolled into your question so ill try and separate it out firstly the tax to be honest has nothing really to do with investment its about how to – dave went through all the benefits and the throughput its about helping employees out of simpler stores because we have a pretty complex store that we want to simplify so i would think about it in line with the benefits that he spells out earlier in terms of investment theres obviously a history when we went out in california we picked up some sites some of them were relatively highpriced sites weve talked about that before im pleased we got into the market early and before anyone else ask the question were delighted with california and weve been delighted i think on every call weve had for the last four or five quarters so thats a continuing story as we go forward id like to believe that as we are this beverageled onthego brand and if you take the stores that have drivethrus  of the business goes through the drivethru if you wanted a nigel prediction this isnt the guidance the nigel prediction is drivethru will continue to increase and im really pleased that daves here because he is a drivethru expert and hes having terrific value already on thinking about the drivethru onthego is a real benefit i think were going to gradually require less space in our restaurants which should bring down capital investment so i disconnect the test the simplifying test id focus very largely on the fact were a togo brand and as a result of that i think ultimately we will require less capital investment because well need less space for people to sit inside the store matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc okay if you dont mind i have a followup regarding discounting also just curious with – in light of one of the larger competitors mentioning sort of leading with discounting for breakfast and coffee how that might impact your outlook for pricing in  or any tactics that you might take as far as when mcdonalds starts discounting more aggressively nationally david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah its dave just stepping back as a brand were going to continue to be about convenience and affordability and driving traffic is as you pointed out as well is a lingering opportunity for us taking those two into account along with what you mentioned around the competitive landscape not just the company you mentioned but weve got opportunities to strengthen our national value voice and so with that one of the things going into  working with chris and the franchisees we saw an opportunity to do this and look were – im not going to discuss individual tactics at this point in time but weve got five new initiatives that were layering in for  and were excited about that because affordability is part of our dna going forward as well nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc and i think its fair to say thats been pretty well accepted in all the discussions we have with franchisees as recently as yesterday david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc thats correct franchisees are aggressive and hungry matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc excellent thank you so much paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc great thanks matthew operator our next question comes from the line of nicole miller with piper jaffray your line is open nicole m miller regan  piper jaffray  co thank you good morning looking at the us franchisees the ones that are accelerating openings like in the white space and infill store openings how is their mood post election and is there more than appetite or is there more optimism for growing a little bit faster with a lower cost i think model approved and then some of the streamlining processes that youre talking about nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so good question probably most of it hasnt anything to do with the election but daves been out and about talking to franchisees a lot so how have they been david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah coming in here the way i talked about development the past couple of years look the slowdown was driven a lot by rising costs and tepid sales i think you just have to throw that out there we think this has huge upside we think an environment going forward that would – if you have government policies that are progrowth less regulation and a clean and efficient tax system with some infrastructure spending we think thats going to be reason to ignite this so at this point weve got a balance between – weve got some internal challenges that were working through and external upside and were confident that the runway for us not just western mississippi but also eastern mississippi is that right in terms of growth nicole m miller regan  piper jaffray  co thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc great thanks nicole next question please operator our next question comes from the line of jeff bernstein with barclays your line is open jeff priester  barclays capital inc hi this is actually jeff priester on for jeff bernstein so going back to the unit guidance historically youve given a range versus this year you kind of gave an exact figure so following the rationale behind that and then going forward on ga is growing at half the rate of revenue still the right way to think about it thanks paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc yes so we didnt – what we said is approximately  so i will prefer you think about that not as an exact point i know it sounds exactly – put the word approximately in front of but were approximately  so were not giving – so think about that not as a precise number and then on ga yes i would continue to think about that growing at about half the rate of revenue jeff priester  barclays capital inc perfect thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc right thanks jeff next question please operator our next question comes from the line of sam beres with robert w baird your line is open sam j beres  robert w baird  co inc broker hi good morning thanks for taking the question may be first in terms of the dunkin us unit growth in q was there anything specific that may have caused the opening to fall slightly below your expectations and may be said differently were there any factors that just cause some timing shifts from q openings to the q openings paul e twohig  dunkin brands group inc yeah this is paul twohig when we look at – go back and look at q we open over  stores in the quarter which was a pretty solid performance but admittedly from where we thought it would be we missed for the year from our guidance by  stores where there are a couple of things here and there that impacted that did i move some contractors in the southeast because of the hurricane did i have some permitting problems yeah on the margins there were two or three here and there but the thing i guess id think about is when you look at opening stores in  the decision to do that was made back in  and some other concerns about or uncertainty our franchisees were looking at from a minimum wage standpoint labor standpoint overall business climate may have caused them to look at things a bit differently or it could be a bit cautious going into  some of those remain unresolved when you look at california and new york and their minimum wage issues so again as paul spoke earlier about the  or the approximate  its a prudent number its the sentiment of our franchisees remain to be very aggressive to grow but theyre going to be prudent nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc i think ill just add to that the number we did in the fourth quarter was actually more than most other companies did in the whole year with the exception of one so i mean i remain very firm on the fact that were a development machine as paul said perhaps we missed one or two as a margin but to develop all those stores in the fourth quarter compared with what everyone else said i think demonstrates the development machine is still very much on track sam j beres  robert w baird  co inc broker great thanks and maybe as a followup paul would you be willing to share maybe a guidance for interest expense in  and then as we think about the potential releveraging event kind of over time i guess what factors would cause you to look at that whether its  or  potential timing and in terms of the interest rate environment with rising rates i mean any rate level where youd be more hesitant to do another releveraging event kind of in the next couple of years here paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc sure so on your first question our interest expense for the year is going to be call it  million  million  million because its obviously all fixed rate net debt assumes kind of current status so we finished the quarter with  times levered and we set our ranges  to  and we delever about  basis points a year so as we think about it and this is still – the thesis of the company is still returning cash to shareholders high cash generation returning it to shareholders so as we look out there before i get to the interest rate question we see this time next year well be down in the ish range so sometime between now and then we think about our relever additionally the other thing that factors in there is we do have fouryear bonds that will be two years old now well this time next year it will be three years the makewhole payments will go away so thats another factor in there of refinancing and getting on the cadence so we like to have bonds coming due every three years to four years and thinking about relevering the company and then on interest rates everything is fixed we do see rising interest rates into the future although as we have seen for many many years the yield curve is never in actual steep as the yield curve is looking out would be number one and then secondly in the securitization market those yields move or those rates move much slower than they do in the traditional bank and bond market so – but we do look at rates this is not a rate i could tell you sam that x were not going to do a relever and why we would i mean if we look at it we look at what it does for the company but this is a cash flow and return capital to shareholder story and it continues to be operator thank you our next question comes from the line of karen holthouse with goldman sachs your line is open gregory lum  goldman sachs  co hi good morning this is actually greg lum on for karen this morning so traffic growth has continued to be a challenge can you maybe just dive into what you think the drivers are do you think its just retail weakness in some of the off peak hours maybe frequency declines or customers lapsing and then if its the customers lapsing where do you think theyre going for coffee instead chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yes so traffic is something that i think youve heard a bunch of our industry peers talk about overall traffic is the challenge we are focused on our sixpoint plan we think that one of the key measures of success will be a return to traffic growth and like dave mentioned before this layer that were putting in on value we think it helps tackle some of those traffic challenges additionally as we move more towards the beverageled onthego brand we expect to drive traffic with that shift in strategy so i think its a good question we are really focused on it and positive traffic is going to be our measure of success and well be able to declare victory when we get there nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so this might be a good opportunity i mean youve heard from us over many years dave has been here for what is it now three and a bit months whats your thoughts about how weve done david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah and just to add on to your question on traffic and ill dive into the other piece as well look i think theres also – you have to acknowledge – i dont know the science behind it but you have to acknowledge a fundamental – also a fundamental shift in consumer behavior with staples were an impulsedriven business and impulse is going the way where you can get a lot of things that you can – staples and things like that you can get online as well so thats where loyalty and digital that youve heard upfront and nigels speech becomes such a big play for us and so again value is going to be an element of that to neutralize it but down the road loyalty and digital platform and i would say ours is right there with the best of them in terms of leading edge in terms of – just getting back to nigels question i believe those in the call know this january is my first full month taking over the us business and id say its as a tribute to nigel and his leadership team for a wellplanned thoughtful transition between paul twohig and myself and look i came here because i believe in this brand our future and the growth levers that are in front of us if i had to tick those off the strategic roadmap is solid the brand positioning of a beverageled onthego brand is clear progressive and forwardleaning were driving greater exposure to highgrowth and highmargin beverages like i said if you listened to nigels opening around digital platform its leadingedge what were doing there there is a lot of runway in terms of unit expansion and ive got a lot of experience doing that overseas and weve got a great drivethru advantage in our existing fleet as well and i think most people forget that were also the category leader in donuts bagels and muffins and these have great attachments so were not – were doubling down on these particular areas because they have great attachments to what were doing around beverages and i think the final thing and this team knows it well ive been on the road a lot since coming here with our franchisees and their restaurants and netnet id leave you with the message that this system is fired up the franchisees are energized and hungry we just saw it in some leadership meetings yesterday and theyre hungry to drive the business so yeah everything is pointing north gregory lum  goldman sachs  co thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc thanks greg next question please operator our next question comes from the line of will slabaugh with stephens your line is open drew stevenson  stephens inc hey thanks guys this is actually drew stevenson on for will so seeing how successful the cold brew has been for you and the overall innovation taking place in the coffee segment should we think about you all being more aggressive in finding additional growth platform opportunities in the future and then could you just talk about how you feel about your beverage pipeline in general thanks nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc yes – pass over to chris chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yeah we feel great about the beverage pipeline its where a lot – our innovation team is spending a lot of time cold brew is a great success and we expect more things like that in the future nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc just a short answer because were really excited about it so were not going to reveal all the things weve got in the pipeline drew stevenson  stephens inc great okay thanks paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc thanks drew next question please operator our next question comes from the line of matt mcginley with evercore your line is open matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc thanks for taking my question my first one is on the implied composition of the comp into  as you went through the course of the year price was obviously a key driver of the comp but as you exited the year youre obviously a lot more disciplined on price but you didnt necessarily see a stepup in traffic so the question is does taking less price risk the comp growth or do you feel that the sixpoint plan and just reducing price overall will have the impact of driving more traffic in  chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc so this is chris again i think were going to – price is going to be a part of our growth in the future i think the reality is were going to take targeted strategic price increases we think a healthy growth is a balance between taking price and traffic growth and our sixpoint plan is designed to do both of those so i wouldnt expect the majority of our growth to come from either side we need to get to a point where both transactions and price are driving our growth matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc good and then on the store growth for  is the composition on a region basis about the same as what you saw in  for that  or do you have more of a shift out into the emerging and west market chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yeah so two things again im going to take the opportunity to say we are at approximately  so matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc sure approximately chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc not using a pinhead there on an exact number and then secondly we stopped guiding on regional development we will update you on it quarterly as we have but over the longterm of the business to answer – and i know this isnt your exact question yes growth will continue to accelerate out west visàvis the core but we dont do quarterly or yearly guidance on regional development matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc okay thank you chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc thanks matt paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc next question operator our next question comes from the line of michael gallo with cl king your line is open michael w gallo  cl king  associates inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question my question is on the repositioning the onthego beverage whether you see any signs that thats changing the mix towards beverage especially in new markets like west coast markets and how you see that evolving in  thanks nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc yeah i think what i would say is  one of the reasons were going down that way is we see not only an opportunity were seeing our performance going there and i would say – not necessarily a scientific analysis in the newer markets we seem to be getting a higher beverage mix faster out the gate than we did previously now thats probably due to the fact weve learned a lot and i mean if i go back and take markets like phoenix which when i came to the business was really struggling with fairly low beverage mix which is a bad term because its really beverage sellers that we look at thats come up astronomically but weve learned many lessons from those early days were applying them to the new markets i think two things that we used to talk about at the ipo but theyre really important still is the fact we have national media that covers all these markets so if youre in a brand new market with one or two stores you have national media like everywhere else and secondly one of the benefits of our cpg strategy is that we are developing the same profile of dunkin products right across the country michael w gallo  cl king  associates inc great paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc thanks michael next question please operator our next question comes from the line of steve anderson with maxim group your line is open stephen anderson  maxim group llc yes good morning i just wanted to ask in regard to your new unit development goals for  i wanted to ask about your plans to expand within the bjs wholesale club i noticed before the yearend you opened about  or more stores within bjs in the new york area and i just wanted to see how that plays into your development goals nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so let me just clarify development goals of  or  stephen anderson  maxim group llc okay within the – and thats inclusive in those stores for  okay thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc so yes so those opened in  and theyre in our numbers in  that we reported of a little bit over  for q well have a few more openings of bjs in  and again its in that approximately  number stephen anderson  maxim group llc all right thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc great thanks steve i know were past the top of the hour i see two more people in the queue so lets take these last two questions and then well wrap up operator our next question comes from the line of joe stauff of susquehanna your line is open joe stauff  susquehanna financial group lllp oh thanks a lot for taking the question i just wanted to come back you addressed in various capacities that your ability to grow units and there have been some factors that maybe have discouraged your ability to grow units at that plus level and i just wondered as a potential investorfranchisor i mean isnt the traffic a significant sort of contributor in terms of just the return dynamics and the unease with respect to investing and attracting that incremental franchisor can you just talk about that i know youve addressed it youve got the point plan but it seems unlikely your traffic issue is going to correct itself for the foreseeable future is that accurate paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc yes so let me start at the end there so will the traffic correct itself so we have the part plan these guys are working on it everything and then making the operations less complex making it a better place to work so yeah i think all of that will address the traffic issues now to when you  start it yes traffic overall comp performance right has been softer than we and our franchisees would expect and that has certainly dampened enthusiasm to open up restaurants now within that were going to open up greater than  restaurants next year so i dont want to over index of – were not opening up any restaurants so again were going to open up approximately  net joe stauff  susquehanna financial group lllp sure paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc restaurants next year so there are a lot franchisees building a lot of restaurants but that being said we get transactions positive and our long term – if you look at our longterm comp goals in the  to  range yeah yeah you get to a  comp its a different story than a one fixed comp right so yeah i think its all those things its no one thing but comps get better restaurant operations get simplified guest experience gets better we focus on beverageled onthego i think all these things are going to come together to really drive developments joe stauff  susquehanna financial group lllp okay i appreciate the response and i just wanted just the ability again to correct in a meaningful way your traffic declines call it roughly  basis points this past year thats something that is still going to take time when you infer to it in your previous comments and so forth is that a fair critique nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so okay so weve been down this route before so let me just give some facts until the last couple of years we grew traffic every year during my time here okay can we get back to positive traffic yes do we have the plans to get back to positive traffic absolutely and im probably more optimistic than i was at the turn of the year because daves really driving here hes really focused on this national value that some of your colleagues point out in their writings regularly so it will take a little bit of time but im more optimistic than i was last year and i want to point out something that dave said that if you look at just about everyone else in our industry there is negative traffic and that includes in the coffee and bakery segment and i think if you actually look at our traffic we outperformed many other large companies joe stauff  susquehanna financial group lllp great paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc thanks joe operator joe stauff  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc lets go to the last question operator our last question comes from the line of matthew difrisco with guggenheim your line is open matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thank you i appreciate the second question with respect i dont think i heard it on the call did you guys mention a percent of sales done on mobile order and pay and i was just curious is potentially the streamlining also a benefit that might help unleash maybe even more greater flowthrough on the mobile order and pay before it would maybe potentially be call it a bottleneck problem at some of those stores just curious if thats in the back of your minds also as you test this  stores to  stores scott hudler  dunkin brands group inc yeah so matt this is scott hudler we did thought its about  of sales from mobile ordering we think its an absolute unlock for making the restaurant experience better so you can have that experience where you can order outside of the restaurant come in speed past the line and get your coffee and food items we think thats a huge unlock we will be looking at that as we tie into the streamlined menu in that store test but we think we are in very early days still weve only had mobile ordering available for a little over six months we think were just scratching the surface and we feel like we build our program and the delivery of it in the restaurant to avoid some of the bottlenecks that you may have been hearing about i think what we have planned for the future this is a real focus of ours is making that experience even better as it scales to become    of sales in the future matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc great excellent paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc thanks matt matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thank you paul c carbone  dunkin brands group inc ill turn it over to nigel nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so thank you everyone for coming to listen to us today youre probably all surrounded by snow like we are i want to say i think we have an excellent year i just want to pick up on what scott said i mean weve got all this technology installed in a franchise system were excited about that as scott was just describing other companies sometimes do it in their company stores but they dont do it in their franchise stores weve done it right across our store base so i think we had an excellent year in  i think we have a wonderful plan thats been validated by consumer insight and i just want to comment ive spent most of the middle of last summer recruiting a new leader for dunkin us it took a lot of time its been worthwhile dave has added a new energy that is compelling to our business so were in great shape as we go into  and we look forward to talking to you again so thanks operator ladies and
