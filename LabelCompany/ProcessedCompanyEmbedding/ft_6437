alfa expected to get fda approval for gaucher’s disease  ftcom ftcomfrontpage uk change edition asia europe india middle east uk us all times are london time register subscribe sign in subscribe you are signed in january    pm shire’s velaglucerase alfa expected to get fda approval for gaucher’s disease by viral gandhi share print clip gift article comments this article is provided to ftcom readers by pharmawire—a news service focused on providing insight into the most price sensitive issues in the global pharmaceutical market wwwpharmawirecom  shire’s velaglucerase alfa for type i gaucher’s disease is expected to receive fda approval by  february according to investigators interviewed by pharmawire genzyme’s cerezyme is currently the only fda approved enzyme replacement therapy ert for the disease an inherited condition in which a fatty substance builds in organs and tissues such as the liver spleen and bone marrow the more common type i form does not affect the central nervous system velaglucerase alfa is a geneactivated ert targeting a slice in a market that is currently worth more than usd bn but dominated by genzyme cerezyme has been available since  velaglucerase alfa is the only ert to be produced in a human cell line  resulting in the drug being identical to the naturally occurring enzyme glucocerebrosidase that’s deficient in gaucher’s patients in contrast cerezyme is produced in chinese hamster ovary cells and protalix’s uplyso taliglucerase alfa another ert currently in preregistration with the fda uses carrot cell plantbased production both these products have a mutation that distinguishes them from the natural enzyme the difference between the products offers at least a theoretical edge to velaglucerase alfa experts have noted and shire’s product is also believed to have increased cellular uptake dr ari zimran director of the gaucher clinic at shaare zedek medical center in jerusalem and an investigator for several gaucher’s trials said that velaglucerase alfa seemed theoretically superior based on early research however he added that the drug is likely to be similar to cerezyme in clinical practice dr atul mehta clinical director of the lysosomal storage disorders unit at the royal free hospital london agreed that despite the native enzyme sequence velaglucerase is not anticipated to have clinical superiority especially since cerezyme is an excellent drug several other experts interviewed by this news service indicated that velaglucerase alfa therapy will likely be similar to cerezyme in safety and efficacy all signs point to approval dr paul fernhoff a clinical geneticist at emory university school of medicine said the data shows no major safety issues with velaglucerase alfa and he does not see any reason why it would not be approved unless something last minute comes up velaglucerase alfa will likely be approved with a strict postmarketing followup fernhoff added one investigator close to shire’s clinical trials had noted that the fda was carrying out an ”extensive” preapproval inspection of clinical trial facilities as previously reported by this news service the source noted that no issues had come up and did not expect any last minute problems to arise adding that velaglucerase alfa will most likely be approved without delays by its prescription drug user fee act or pdufa date dr david kuter professor at harvard medical school and director of clinical hematology at massachusetts general hospital speculated that velaglucerase alfa will be approved with a typical postmarketing study he added that there has been discontent with genzyme among some physicians due to the high cost of the product and manufacturing issues last year that temporarily stalled production kuter noted that new therapies appear to be equally efficacious compared to cerezyme and therefore many of his patients are looking forward to switching therapies on the other hand dr roscoe brady scientist emeritus at the national institutes of health and a medical board member of national gaucher foundation noted that patients have been happy with cerezyme and many of them may not want to change therapies despite the manufacturing issues however some of these patients are already receiving shire’s enzyme under the fda expanded access program which was put in place to address the cerezyme shortage shire also provided the therapy for free brady added theresa heggie head of global strategic marketing and lysosomal storage disorders development at shire noted that the company has worked to accelerate clinical and manufacturing timelines over the past six months she added that if the fda were to make a decision prior to the pdufa date of  february the company ”would be ready” she also said that sales force ”training and readiness efforts are complete” heggie confirmed that the fda recently completed the preapproval inspections of shire facilities in cambridge and lexington massachusetts for the manufacturing and testing of velaglucerase alfa fda has been ”quite responsive” in terms of inspections she added pricing will be key to adoption the main issue in terms of adoption of velaglucerase will ultimately be pricing since everything else is essentially the same as cerezyme gaucher’s experts noted one year therapy for gaucher’s can cost up to usd year with demonstration of noninferiority to cerezyme being the most likely scenario price will be the predominant factor for market adoption said dr gregory pastors of new york university medical center who has been involved with other gaucher’s trials he added that some patients who received velaglucerase alfa free of charge due to expanded access will have a ”taste for the drug” and may prefer to continue with it dr ozlem gokeralpan a former researcher at the national human genome research institute said she expects velaglucerase will be approved and hopes that the introduction of new drugs will create healthy competition and bring down the cost for gaucher’s disease therapeutics many gaucher’s patients have reached their lifetime insurance maximum and are unable to afford drugs alpan said dr roberto giugliani a professor in the department of genetics at the federal university of rio grande do sul noted that he looks forward to the approval of velaglucerase alfa newer treatments will be just as safe and efficacious  but cheaper  making gaucher’s therapy more affordable especially in developing nations such as brazil  for more information or to inquire about a trial please
