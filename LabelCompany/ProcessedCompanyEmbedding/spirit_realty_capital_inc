situations reits dividend investingsummarythe retail sector malaise has spilled into the triple net lease reitsan unusually bad quarter has sent spirit realty corp down almost  from its recent highwe note several positives about the reit that allowed us to initiate a small positionspirit realty capitals nysesrc q was really spooky and there might be more pain ahead but current extreme valuations and the fortress balance sheet compel us to take a position ahead of q results the last year has been a painful one for those who chose to invest in the retail space whether it was the retailers themselves the retail mall reit group the triple net reits you were in for a rough ride within the latter two groups spirit realty capital src was one of the worst performers outdone only by pennsylvania reit pei we hold a constructive outlook on pei and so we decided to see if src was worth an investment as well the business src is a triple net lease reit focusing on the retail sector while majority of the its revenue is derived from retail the small components of office and industrial help provide some level of diversification additionally a large subset of retail is serviceoriented versus traditional retail and hence less vulnerable to ecommerce the recent issues the stock had been trending down in sympathy with the retailer woes but the q results is what created the big selloff src decreased its guidance by about  for  decided to stop acquiring new properties and brought to light several troubled retailers on their watch list that had defaulted the analyst call was not a pleasant one for management with  different analysts daniel donlan anthony paolone  rob stevenson either directly asking or suggesting that the company should basically sell and go private the additional issue that came to light was that management had factored in a rapid turnaround on some troubled properties to get to the new guidance of  in affo failing that the affo could come in significantly lower the portfolio looking at the statistics revealed by src on their portfolio i got a feeling that some of the panic was the overly cautious tone of management source src presentation with a median x rent coverage there is quite a lot of cushion for the underlying tenants to navigate difficult times for comparison omega health investors inc ohi has a x rent coverage while they are completely different industries they have strong similarities long triple net leases and recent oversupply and other industry woes a legion of investors consider ohi to be an absolutely fantastic investment even with such poor rent coverage by their underlying tenants while src has been relegated to the dog house of course from an investment standpoint it is not their median properties that are the issue it is their lower end ones that create the problems still their overall distribution across different industries and their weighted average lease term of over  years is comforting the bulk of their tenants have master lease clauses with cross default provisions shopko their biggest tenant also has a rent coverage of x as mentioned on the conference call additionally over  of their tenants are creditrated or implied creditrated again to equate to a retail triple net lease reit realty income o derives approximately  of its income from investment grade equivalent tenants valuation src trades at about x  affo and has a  dividend yield the dividend payout is slightly below  assuming the midpoint of  guidance is met the implied cap rate on their portfolio is around  source authors estimates and calculations realty income with what we consider a slightly better portfolio trades at a  cap rate while realty income is definitely in a better position than src we do not see the distinction equivalent to  cap rate or twice the affo multiple lease maturities and debt the lease maturities are quite modest and allow src to navigate this environment well source src  annual report the debt maturities are also well staggered and there is nothing on the horizon that concerns us for a triple net at x debt to ebitda both debt to ebitda and unencumbered assets to total assets ratio have been moving in the right direction since the ipo conclusion the pressure is definitely on srcs management to perform if they thought q conference call was difficult then they are in for a storm in q if they do not deliver i think there is still a good chance of a further cut in guidance as management numbers are a tad optimistic we still like the valuation here and we are happy initiating a position after such a heavy selloff rather than getting sucked in at the highs we have taken a small position ahead of q at  with the intention of adding should the stock have another significant selloff on our now famous scale of  where  would be avoid like the bubonic plague and  would be buy like this is apple in march  i would rate this a  we have a target price of

the “death of retail” has been a recurring theme of  as amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn and other online retailers continue to erode the traditional brickandmortar business model but one retail reit in particular stands out for having been beaten like the proverbial redheaded stepchild spirit realty capital inc nysesrcspirit realty capital inc newmoresource shutterstockyeartodate the battered reit is down nearly  and declines in src stock have pushed the yield above after a drop like that it’s fair to ask if wall street overreacted as it is wont to do after all most of the decline happened on a single day last month following a disappointing earnings announcementso let’s take a look at spirit to see if we might have a value opportunityreit ticker priceffo div yield payout ratio realty income o    national retail properties nnn    store capital stor    spirit realty capital src   on paper spirit looks cheap relative to its peers in the triplenet retail space src stock trades for  times its expected  funds from operations ffo which is about half the valuation of industry leader realty income corp nyseo for the uninitiated ffo is a measure of earnings for reits that strips out noncash expenses such as depreciation you can think of the priceffo ratio as the reit equivalent of the priceearnings or pe ratio warren buffetts  best dividend stocks for retirement likewise spirit’s dividend yield is significantly higher than its peers its yield is double that of national retail properties inc nysennn and more than double that of realty incomeof course an extremely high dividend yield is usually a sign of trouble ahead… and a sign that the market expects a dividend cut indeed spirit’s dividend currently eats up  of its ffo and that’s cutting it close so we’re likely looking at zero dividend growth over the next few yearsto be clear i don’t consider src to be at immediate risk of a dividend cut at least as long as it avoids a major tenant bankruptcy more on that laterwhy the discountso we’ve established that sprit realty capital is cheap at least relative to its peers the next question is whyit comes back to amazon and the death of retail one of spirit’s largest tenants is the struggling retail chain shopko which is having to close stores shopko is responsible for  of spirit’s revenue so any major setback here could make it difficult for spirit to continue paying its dividend at current levels spirit announced higherthanexpected impairment charges in early may related to shopko and other struggling tenants and also lowered its earnings guidance and reduced its expansion plans as a result that lead to the massive rout in the stock pricebut is it justifiedlet’s imagine the worst happened and shopko stopped paying rent at all of its locations at the same time that revenue isn’t lost “forever” spirit could either sell the stores or find new tenants but that could also take several months and finding quality bigbox tenants isn’t particularly easy these days is microsoft corporation msft stock an unstoppable behemoth so we’re not talking about a cataclysmic companyending disaster but it would be something that would likely cause spirit to substantially lower its dividenda more likely scenario would be that spirit muddles through taking additional impairment charges over the next few quarters but manages to keep its dividend intact albeit barely assuming no major unexpected hiccups spirit will probably modestly outperform its safer but more expensive peers your risk is that a steady stream of disappointing earnings reports keeps
