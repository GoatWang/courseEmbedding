traded company more information ims in the news ims barter million dollar club testimonials for over a decade now i have been a member of the barter system in peterborough while i have always benefited from the organization the last  years have been the best ive ever experienced as you are aware barter really comes down to  main benefits  it becomes a competitive edge to garner new and continued sales in a market where buying trends are fickle and subject to pricesensitivity customers that utilize their barter with us tend to stay loyal longterm customers we have become the supplier of choice to many barter clients it is essential to note that each customer purchasing from dominos pizza does not purchase from anyone else market share tips in our favor  barter keeps cash in the bank or conserves cash for other projects the ability to make use of the incremental sales that barter provides to purchases supplies and services for the stores has greatly reduced the demand on cash resources in the last  years the availability of these products and services has expanded exponentially  finally barter has helped to make me a hero at home by using barter to subtly improve our own personal lives we have enjoyed benefits that we would not have been able to otherwise these things have included extra holiday time away meals out or activities for the family to participate in

entire prospectus carefully before making an investment decision including the �risk factors� section beginning on page� and the documents and information incorporated by reference into this prospectus we refer to international monetary systems ltd as �ims� the �company� �we� �our� and �us� � international monetary systems ltd was incorporated in  under the laws of the state of wisconsin the company acquires owns manages and operates trade exchanges and other related businesses � trade exchanges or barter networks are financial service firms which permit companies and individuals to exchange goods and services utilizing an electronic currency known as trade dollars the use of which is described below currently ims services more than  barter customers we have continually expanded our customer base principally through enrolling new members in our existing markets acquiring other barter exchanges and by encouraging our members to increase their trade volume � our corporate headquarters mailing address is  west glendale drive new berlin wisconsin  and our telephone numbers are   and   the telephone number for our primary facsimile line is   our internet addresses are wwwinternationalmonetarycom and wwwimsbartercom � the modern barter industry � the modern barter industry took shape in its current form in  with the creation of the first retail barter exchange currently there are an estimated  barter system firms  including several with multiple licensees  operating in the united states and canada these exchanges provide services that involve an estimated  member companies � retail trade exchanges range in size from those operated by a single person from a small office to large firms operating out of multiple offices located over a wide area the  largest commercial exchange firms handle approximately  of the estimated  million in transactions that flow through the barter system annually most trade exchanges are private companies that make extensive use of computers to track their members match transactions and provide necessary accounting � the national association of trade exchanges and the international reciprocal trade association are the two professional associations most active in the industry � how barter works � in a typical barter transaction a member offers to sell products or services in return for the exchanges trade dollars typically referenced as t which are paid to the member by the purchaser in the transaction for example t refers to  worth of trade dollars that are used to acquire a product or service priced at  in us currency if the purchase price is greater than the amount of earned trade dollars in the buyers account the exchange may grant a trade dollar line of credit to the buyer periodically each member has to account for any deficit in its trade account just as it would with a conventional loan or other credit facility � as compensation for providing its services the trade exchange generally charges a onetime membership fee monthly maintenance fees andor a percentage of the price of each transaction usually  to  these fees are typically paid by the member to the trade exchange in cash � barter transactions which represent sales revenue are taxable as ordinary income to the recipient of the trade dollars in the conventional dollar amount of the trade dollars received and conversely are deductible as ordinary expense by a purchaser in the conventional dollar amount of the trade dollars paid members barter sales are reportable by the trade exchange to the internal revenue service on form b � advantages and disadvantages � barter offers a number of advantages to those who utilize it a principle advantage to trade exchange members is referred to as barter leverage this refers to the fact that the typical barter exchange member is purchasing a product or service in exchange for its own product or service consequently each purchase results in a probable sale and since the actual cash cost of producing the product or service is typically less than its retail sale price a person utilizing barter is actually purchasing for a real cash cost that is only a fraction of the price of the product or service purchased in effect the barter exchange member buys at wholesale but sells its own goods or services at retail frequently the member will charge a higher price for barter than for cash to cover the charges due to the trade exchange however the benefit to the person bartering for the product or service is still significant as a result of the purchase being accomplished through barter �  � for example a trade exchange member may incur a  cash cost to produce a product or to purchase it at wholesale if the member then barters this product for a good or service priced at  representing the retail price at which it is normally sold the member has effectively bought the good or service for a cost of only  in cash barter leverage is particularly effective in the case of products that have become hard to sell rather than write down their value the producer may be able to secure full value by bartering them through the trade exchange barter leverage works most effectively when trading for something that is perishable such as hotel rooms or airline tickets once the hotel room lies vacant or the airline seat is unfilled for a flight its value is lost forever in those cases exchange of the room or seat in barter offers an effective way to gain value from something that would otherwise have been rendered worthless due to barter leverage the value of barter to exchange members will more than likely offset the fees charged by the barter exchange � barter also provides an effective means by which a member may enter new markets gain trial usage by potential customers or increase market share the member may well find that he can reach a customer who would not otherwise have tried his product or service if the full price had to be paid in cash but who will try his goods or services sometimes in large amounts or on extended terms when the price is being paid in goods or services of the purchaser in the form of trade dollars because of the need to clear trade dollars over time barter exchanges become affinity marketing networks in which members seek out opportunities to do business with one another the principal disadvantage of barter is that in comparison to the general cashbased economy a more limited supply of products and services is available � international monetary systems ltd � international monetary systems ltd imsl is a holding company that currently has three subsidiaries continental trade exchange ltd doing business as international monetary systems ims national trade association inc and inlm holdings inc the ims barter system operates in the united states and canada � the ims barter network � as a leader in the barter industry ims has created a network of more than  businesses that regularly trade their goods and services with each other through their participation in our barter program these companies are provided with an effective revenue management tool which enables them to identify and capture incremental income move surplus inventories and profitably capitalize on their excess capacity ims functions as a thirdparty record keeper  a status granted by the internal revenue service  and also manages the barter system � to provide clients with a flexible and effective means of trading ims has created an alternative monetary system with its own unique currency upon enrolling in the program each member is assigned a barter account much like a traditional bank account through which it receives ims trade dollars  the medium of exchange for the barter system under the tefra act of  we are required to report all barter sales to the irs for accounting and tax purposes the irs has ruled that trade dollars are treated the same as cash accordingly the company may in any period report significant revenue profits and increases in net assets from transactions denominated in ims trade dollars or other noncash consideration � the ims barter system began operations in july of  and has had a record of consistent and steady growth this growth has been generated both internally and through the acquisition of other barter networks as we have continued to add new members to the system we have witnessed a compounded annual growth rate of approximately  per year for the past decade during that same period we have also acquired twenty two independent trade exchange operations we believe that the barter industry much like the banking industry is ready for a period of substantial consolidation and therefore we intend to continue acquiring strategically located trade exchanges that we believe will enable us to achieve and maintain a dominant market position we believe that a dominant position within a market gives us better visibility within that market allows us to offer a wider range of customer products and services for the benefit of our clients and ensures that we will achieve greater economies of scale �  � five of those acquisitions

sustained � while our common stock is currently quoted on the otc bulletin board we cannot provide definite assurance that our shares will be actively traded the development and continuation of a trading market will depend principally upon our business financial condition and operating results since the market price for our common stock is below  per share sec rules will impose additional requirements upon brokerdealers who effect transactions in our shares principally with respect to  additional disclosures concerning the risks of investment in lowerpriced stocks  written investorsuitability determinations and  written authorization of these transactions by the proposed purchasers compliance with these rules could impede trading and adversely impact the price and liquidity of your shares � increased regulation of the barter industry could negatively affect our business � the barter industry is in large part currently selfregulated we have obtained all federal state and local licenses permits and bonds necessary to operate our business and facilities however we cannot assure you that the barter industry in general and our company in particular will not in the future be subject to increased and more restrictive governmental regulation if such regulation restricts or limits our ability to conduct our business or if we are required to pay substantial compliance costs our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed and the return on your investment in our common stock might be negatively affected � provisions in our charter documents and wisconsin law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company and possibly reduce the amount paid for our common stock in the future � provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and wisconsin law could separately or together discourage potential acquisition proposals delay or prevent a change in control and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock � the application of these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders see �description of securities  antitakeover provisions� for a further discussion of statutory and other antitakeover provisions which may affect us also our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price voting rights restrictions preferences and privileges of those shares without the approval of our stockholders the rights of holders of common stock will be subject to and may be impaired by the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may delay defer or prevent a change in control by making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our stock in addition the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock however even the potential issuance of preferred stock could reduce the price that investors are willing to pay for our common stock � neither our president our chief financial officer nor either of our vice presidents is covered by �key person� life insurance and the loss of one or more of these key personnel could adversely affect our business results and the value of your investment � our future success depends upon the continued services of our management team including our president donald f mardak our treasurer danny w weibling and our two vice presidents dale l mardak and john e strabley the loss of the services of any one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and potentially the value of your investment in our common stock we do not have �key person� life insurance policies covering any of our employees �  � we do not intend to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future � we currently intend to retain earnings if any to support our growth strategy consequently a prospective investor who needs to receive periodic dividend income should probably not invest in this offering � provisions in our charter documents and wisconsin law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company and possibly reduce the amount paid for our common stock in the future � provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and wisconsin law separately or together may � � discourage potential acquisition proposals � � delay or prevent a change in control and � � limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock � the application of these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders see �description of securities  wisconsin antitakeover provisions� for

third party to acquire a majority of our stock in addition the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock however even the potential issuance of preferred stock could reduce the price that investors are willing to pay for our common stock � substantial sales of our common stock by existing securityholders or even the potential that such sales may occur could cause the price of our stock to fall � future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair the value of your investment in our common stock and our ability to raise equity capital in the future as of september   we had  shares of common stock outstanding of which  shares are beneficially owned by our directors and executive officers � the sales of our common stock by securityholders or even the appearance that such holders may make such sales may limit the market for our common stock or depress any trading market volume and price before other investors are able to sell the common stock moreover a number of shareholders have held their investment for a substantial period of time and may desire to sell their shares which could drive down the price of our common stock � the market price of the shares may fluctuate greatly investors in ims bear the risk that they will not recover their investment � from june   to june   our common stock has traded on the otc bb under the symbol �inlm� currently trading in our common stock on the otc bb is limited and the per share price is likely to be influenced by the price at which and the amount of shares the selling securityholders are attempting to sell at any time with the possible effect of limiting the trading price or lowering the price to their offering price shares such as ours are also subject to the activities of persons engaged in short selling securities which generally has the effect of driving the price down also the common stock of growth companies such as ims is typically subject to high price and volume volatility therefore the price of our common stock may fluctuate widely a full and stable trading market for our common stock may never develop in which event any holder of our common stock may not be able to sell at the time he elects or at all �  � use of proceeds � all of the shares of common stock covered by this prospectus may be sold or otherwise disposed of for the account of the selling securityholders we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the shares or interests therein by the selling securityholders � registration rights � pursuant to an

director liability and indemnification � under wisconsin law and our bylaws we are required to indemnify our officers directors employees and agents in certain situations in some instances a court must approve indemnification as permitted by wisconsin statutes the articles of incorporation eliminate in certain circumstances the monetary liability of our directors for a breach of their fiduciary duties these provisions do not eliminate a director�s liability for � � � a willful failure to deal fairly with us or our shareholders in connection with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of interest � � � a violation of criminal law unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful � � � a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal profit and � � � willful misconduct � as to indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act for directors officers or persons controlling the company we have been informed that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy and therefore unenforceable� � shareholder action � under our bylaws the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to authorize ratify or consent to any action required by the common shareholders except as otherwise provided by the wisconsin business corporation law under the wisconsin business corporation law and our bylaws our shareholders may also take actions by written consent without holding a meeting the written consent must be signed by all of the holders of the voting power except that if a different proportion of voting power is required for a specific action then that proportion if this occurs we are required to provide prompt notice of any corporate action taken without a meeting to our shareholders who did not consent in writing to the action � antitakeover provisions � our articles of incorporation and the wisconsin business corporation law include a number of provisions that may have the effect of encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts � section  of the wisconsin business corporation law provides that the voting power of shares of a �resident domestic company� such as ims which are held by certain persons in excess of  of the voting power of any such corporation will be limited to  of the full voting power of such excess shares this statutory voting restriction is not applicable to shares acquired directly from ims shares acquired prior to april   and under certain other circumstances �  � section  of the wisconsin business corporation law provides that a �resident domestic corporation� such as ims may not engage in a �business combination� with an �interested stockholder� a person beneficially owning  or more of the voting power of the outstanding common stock for three years after the date the stock acquisition date the interested stockholder acquired his  or greater interest unless the business combination or the acquisition of the  or greater interest was approved before the stock acquisition date by the corporations board of directors after the threeyear period a business combination that was not so approved can be consummated only if it is approved by the majority of the outstanding voting shares not held by the interested stockholder or is made at a specified formula price intended to provide a fair price for the shares held by noninterested stockholders � we believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because among other things negotiation of the proposals might result in an improvement of their terms �  � selling
