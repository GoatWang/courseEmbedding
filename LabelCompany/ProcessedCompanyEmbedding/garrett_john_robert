garrett johns father robert garrett had become a successful merchant and shipper in baltimore and had extensive interests throughout the east he stepped in to assist the financially embarrassed baltimore and ohio railroad in several ways bonds were sold to finance the extension to wheeling wv and his firm assisted in making various management decisions robert garretts sons henry and john w garrett became members of the board of directors of the railroad   in  at the age of  john w garrett became the president of the baltimore and ohio railroad and thereafter devoted most of his time to its operation   like many baltimore families the garrett family was divided in loyalty between the north and the south henry supported the south and john supported the north the baltimore and ohio railroad was a northern railroad even though its tracks came below the masondixon line   despite the danger from southern troops the baltimore and ohio railroad was kept busy as the only rail line between washington dc and the northern states it operated almost continuously despite occasional interruptions and much interference by the confederate forces   in october  john w garrett put a train at the disposal of president abraham lincoln who journeyed to antietam he invited garrett to join him and on october   matthew brady photographed lincoln general george b mcclellan who was to run against lincoln for president in  and john w garrett in front of general mcclellans tent on the battlefield   lincoln paid high tribute to the baltimore and ohio railroad for the services rendered during the war and declared that john w garrett was the right arm of the federal government in the aid he rendered to the authorities in preventing the confederates from seizing washington and securing its retention as the capital of the loyal states the decade following the civil war was one of tremendous economic expansion especially for the nations railroads during the s the rail mileage more then doubled from  miles to  miles in    chicago was rapidly becoming the railroad center of the united states a railroad without a connection to chicago could not effectively compete in a national market thus john w garrett started making plans to expand his railroad westward from pittsburgh to chicago this proved to be impossible so an alternative plan which was far less expensive was made to build a branch from the newarksandusky line straight across the comparatively level areas of northern ohio and indiana to chicago john w garrett is credited with connecting baltimore and chicago with this railroad expansion john w garrett died september     the city of garrett was founded as a divisional point for the baltimore and ohio railroad on the chicago route the city was incorporated in  and was laid out by beverly l randolph mrs randolph named the main street in town after herself and many of the original streets including keyser king cowen and quincy were named

garrett who seized the discus in his right hand and swinging himself around and around the way the hammer is usually thrown threw the discus with tremendous force garretts first two throws were clumsy instead of sailing parallel to the ground the discus turned over and over and narrowly missed hitting some of the audience both foreigners and americans laughed at his efforts and he joined in the general merriment his final throw however punctuated with a loud grunt sent the discus sailing  centimetres  in beyond the secondplace throw by panagiotis paraskevopoulos mark at  metres  ft  in

they ascribed a supernatural invincibility enabling them to dispense with training and to win at games which they had never before seen according to james connolly in five of the track and field events won by americans they had not had a single day of outdoor practice since the previous fall garrett also won the shot put with a distance of  metres  ft  in and finished second in the high jump
