probably the worst at dealing with pain and the day preceding my appointment to extract a few teeth and get a crown had my nerves on edge i had been putting off the work because going through the pain was so terrifying i had a tooth extracted several years ago by a dentist who didnt make sure the numbing had taken full effect i fill every thing so im always apprehensivegoing to the dentist from that experience and always expect the worst however after explaining this to my dentist that aspen dental she made sure that i was fully numb and broke up the procedure into several stages to help me cope with everything i usually always feel the needle when they numb it but she did something so that i could not feel the needle which is often the worst part of the procedure for me the whole extraction was very painless and it all had to do with her making sure i was comfortable and that she wasnt rushing things to get me out of the chair and onto the next patient i had some other complications after the procedure that required everyone having to stay longer but the whole staff were very thoughtful and attentive i was very well taken care of even though my procedure took much longer to complete i was not rushed and my dentist made sure to take time to be gentle so the trauma wasnt as bad on me personally the nursing staff there are all very kind non judge mental and make you feel comfortable i honestly felt like i was treated the same way they would treat their own family i really cant say enough jax emergency dental  universityemil h ratedit was pm my tooth was hurting like crazy i couldnt sleep i stayed up until am it was a nightmare my tooth was broken and it was causing so much painafter searching google for hours and hours and calling plenty of dentists i reached a few some told me they were booked until weeks from now – are you kidding me ill be dead by thenthen i saw these folks emergency dentist i was a little worried it might carry an emergency fee so i looked at what people said about them there was one person palmer that clearly finds  without insurance for a tooth being pulled out a little too pricey so i decided id take the risk even though with  stars on yelp its not much of a risk the pain was too much i walked in waited an hour its an emergency dentist  no one can be treated instantly even in hospital ers you have to wait then within m and a ton of anesthesia  no pain no problem i was done i asked the doc thats it it took  minutes to set it all up and they were very encouraging the entire time they really make you feel like youre winning a nobel peace prize while they patiently perform their magic on your teami dont like to take risks so ill definitely be coming again next time i screw up my teeth highly recommend these folks emiljax emergency dental  universitychelsey s ratedi went to the jed a few monthsi went to the jed a few months ago after my regular dentist told me all  of my wisdom teeth were badly impacted and needed to come out asap they wanted to charge over k for the extraction and there was no way i could afford that plus the earliest they could get me in was almost two months out i didnt want my wisdom teeth pushing against the rest of my teeth and crowding them needless to say i wanted to get a second opinion and someone suggested jax emergency dental i showed up early one morning and fully expected to be there for a few hours at least i explained why i was there filled out the paperwork and was xrayed and in a room within  minutes dr t came in and explained the procedure and made sure i didnt have any questions or concerns we got started and he assured me throughout the procedure that i was doing great and everything was going smoothly the procedure that my regular dentist told me would be extremely difficult and had me terrified about was done in about  minutes with no pain on my end dr t and the entire staff were excellent and made what could have been a terrible experience very very easy not to mention considerably cheaper i highly recommend them lee aesthetic dentistrygavin t ratedevery time i have an appointment with lee aesthetic dentistry i leave feeling sorry for anyone that goes to another dentist because theres no way they could be as good as dr lee and his staff from the moment i walk in to the tastefully decorated lobby im warmly welcomed by the front staff when i get back to the chair i receive nothing short of impeccable care from the hygienist to dr lee theyre all first class and too often these days you feel many dentists will try to upsell you not this team they suggest treatment plans they take genuine interest in what you want to get out of the appointment and they bring attention to areas they may see but its never done with a used car salesman approach they work with you and help prioritize if needed and when they do any kind of work from cleaning to extensive procedures its really done second to none looking for a dentist stop the search pickup the phone and go see themdr jeffrey bowdenbarbara j ratedits been sometime ago but ive had numerous root canals and every one of them was done by dr bowden i refer everyone who tells me they need a root canal to him he is wonderful in my book i was referred to him for a root canal that he looked at and said the tooth could not be saved he not only recommended pulling the tooth but offered to pull it right then i feel he could have done the root canal and i would have paid then later id have to have the tooth pulled that tooth had an abcess that hadnt been caught before this

my kids no longer fear going to the dentist a fear they developed while seeing their previous dentist i recommend dr blake to all my friends and have received no complaints from any of them i give

she was fantastic i almost fell asleep during the process which is a great thing she was also extremely knowledgeable of her profession and had a great sense of humor while doing the procedure i highly recommend her for your cleanings if she is available i will definitely come back for my follow up appointments  thank youlee aesthetic dentistrymtccfamily rateddr lee and his staff are wonderful my husband and i starting going to dr lee more than  yrs ago over the past several years our insurance changed and unfortunately he was not in our network of dentists last year our insurance changed again and going back to dr lee was our  priority for a dentist he is a very dedicated and compassionate dentist and his staff and office are very welcoming he is a very thorough and takes his time with you to be sure you understand everything hightly recommendeddid you knowtypes of dentiststhe human mouth is a complex biological system and no two individuals have the same oral care needs here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral healthgeneral dentist these dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care if you need your teeth cleaned crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures book an appointment with a general dentist though not as common these dentists will also provide more specialized services including some forms of oral surgery  chief among them root canals and restorative care  fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutritionendodontist to become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school as a result these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work while a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week an endodontist may end up working on  or more in the same timespan your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments which is repeat root canal procedure their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment  especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformitiespediatric dentist proper oral care starts when youre young and thats why pediatric dentists are so important these dentists treat people under the age of  though there are exceptions based on a childs unique dental background pediatric dentists face unique challenges because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeththough cleanings are an integral part of their job pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead that means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite however they also help address more childspecific conditions of thumb sucking and an overreliance on pacifiers as a result pediatric dentists usually require an additional twoyear residency working with infants and childrenoral pathologist pathology refers to the study of disease specifically as it presents in tissue oral pathologists then are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups these experts are considered to be true specialists having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology though oral pathology is rather specialized its a vital component of the oral health industry by analyzing tissue taken from biopsies oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases including leukoplakia cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma among othersperiodontist similar to the endodontist periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school however whereas endodontists study advanced treatments periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis periodontitis which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment and other periodontal diseases periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds those people who require root planing  where dentists clean any infected surfaces  and root debridement or the removal of dead tissue periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health including painful recession and teeth alignmentcosmetic dentist most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and wellbeing of a patients teeth while that is important to cosmetic dentists they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth to begin the average appointment cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned the most popular such treatments are bleaching  where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth  placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth and bonding where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement materialorthodontist orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities which includes everything from misaligned jaws  like an under or overbite  to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues following dental school the wouldbe orthodontist then has another three years of schooling most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program to properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear that includes braces retainers and various facemask configurations though orthodontists work with people of all ages the bulk of patients are young children and teensprosthodontist similar to the field of orthodontics the average prosthodontist receives an additional three years of training following dental school and though prosthodontics is something of a cosmetic field like orthodontics its primarily concerned with replacing missing teeth prosthodontists have a number of teethreplacing procedures to implement including filling veneers onlays and inlays bridges crowns and complete or partial dentures beyond their work in implant dentistry these experts treat a number of other mouthrelated ailments namely snoring postcancer jaw reconstruction traumatic injuries and pain

forget the tongue within your mouth your tongue is the largest source of bacteria be sure to brush it front to back and dont forget the sidesfloss everyday brushing alone isnt enough to keep your mouth healthy and thats why flossing is so important each time you floss be sure to have at least  inches of floss available which is what you should go through if you use proper technique for optimal

of your greater wellbeing which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical historyfind a recommendation its important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with because thats difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book you should always seek out a recommendation whether its a friend family member or coworker this individual can offer intimate details about a dentists demeanor operating style and approach to patient care be sure to always ask plenty of questionsvet your dentist once you get a recommendation from a friend dont simply book your first cleaning right away instead meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview during this session you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often procedures theyre not as familiar with what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentists scheduleconsider accessibility and other factors perhaps youve met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable not only that but this dentists payment options are suitable for your finances however dont be so quick to make a final decision as other factors may influence your choice is the dentists office nearby or do you have to drive out of your way is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule how much flexibility will the dentists staff offer in booking appointments though seemingly trivial these factors are nonetheless importantcheck with your state board one of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your states dental board dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet these organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentists background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actionspicking the right dental insuranceas with other forms of health care insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible however you dont want to simply buy the first such plan you see here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurancepick your plan there is no such thing as a onesizefitsall dental insurance plan instead most people purchase three main varieties usually through their employers an indemnity or feeforservice plan is just as it sounds and means youll have to pay for annual deductibles and coinsurance payments out of pocket a preferred provider organization is less costly and you choose from a network of dentists however ppos have some limitations and accompanying deductibles similarly a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs however these hmo are usually much less costlyexamine the networks as noted ppo plans and dental hmos work with only a select number of doctors while that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options it also means you dont have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you that doesnt necessarily have to be a bad thing especially if you know who is in the network before purchasing the plan youll receive a list of dentists in each network do research on each doctor  just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise from there you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirementsconsider your coverage sometimes its not just the doctor that you want to consider for many people even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice the reason the coverage is lessthanstellar when picking a plan you need to look at just how much youll pay for each and every service for instance some plans wont cover your fillings or xrays while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction knowing just what youll be responsible for is important as you dont want to be caught offguard by unforeseen charges depending on your employer a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage optionsmake your plan work for you its a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan youve purchased however that doesnt mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere if youre truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available that means potentially deal with costs and other insurancerelated factors that you might have wanted to if need be you might be able to work with the dentists office to address some of the planspecific concerns we just
