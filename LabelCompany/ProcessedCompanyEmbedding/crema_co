whole coffee in the office workplace has become an important amenity for employees as well as an important signifier of a progressive business culture even the wall street journal has taken notice of the growing trend among corporations installing baristastaffed inoffice mini cafes in addition to break rooms for the more traditional diy office coffee arrangements the process of ordering beans through catering or office supply distributors is not unlike the sort of online coffee subscription services that have proliferated in recent years through third parties or directly through roasting companies — although the pitch from coffeefocused services is of course better coffee yet to this point standalone subscription services have tended to aim directly toward consumers and few have made concerted innovative efforts in the office segment meanwhile office managers often remain in the precarious position of choosing the allimportant coffee on behalf of the office which can be a roll of the dice when aiming to please a motley team online multiroaster subscription company cremaco has announced the rollout of a new feature aimed at solving and streamlining the coffee dilemma in the uptodate office slack integration “the crema bot not only keeps your slack team in the loop about events such as a new coffee delivery or upcoming shipment but it also enables everyone in the team to rate each coffee and vote on what to get next right from slack” cremaco ceo tyler tate stated in a recent press release slack is leading cloudbased team communication tool that functions essentially as a featurerich chatting app allowing for conversations to live in indexed searchable channels where employees can interact upload files and connect and organize other apps more than  thirdparty apps and services now integrate with slack and as of today cremaco is one of them as workers click yay or nay via the cremaco slack app to rate coffees as they’re consumed the subscription service’s learning algorithm adapts subsequent recommendations to zero in on collective tastes team members also cast votes towards the next purchase in slack which is surely a step up from a convoluted email chain or a show of hands in a conference room or however else office coffee choices are made the crema slack app doesn’t handle personal individual accounts — only office accounts — so individuals won’t find their virtual workplaces cluttered or distracted by personal coffeeordering opportunities individual accounts are still dealt with in the usual way through cremaco’s phonetablet app or website where offices without slack integration can also set up accounts cremaco ceo tyler tate options currently available through cremaco’s service which launched less than two years ago include coffees from  different highend roasters from across the united states the company also donates  for every purchased pound bag to nonprofit food  farmers which works to improve food security in latin american coffeegrowing regions “the top question we’ve been hearing over and over is ‘could you deliver to my office too” tate said “we’re now answering that question in a big way” howard bryman

grounds after it’s done brewing will result in overextraction so we recommend you decant the coffee immediately uneven grinding can also contribute to bitterness tiny pieces of ground coffee called ‘fines’ extract faster than larger pieces consider using a burr grinder if you aren’t already or changing the burrs on your grinder if theyre getting old boilinghot water can scorch the coffee and cause bitterness the ideal temperature is around ° which you can achieve by bringing the water to a boil and then letting it sit one minute old coffee stuck in the filter will impart unpleasant

coffee producing countries brew list your brew list is always just a click away got it coffee producing countries americas brazil you may be sipping your brew in the peace and safety of your own home but the coffee world has not always been dramafree for example coffee came to brazil via espionage and intrigue prior to the ’s coffee cultivation was a closely guarded treasure and the few countries possessing coffee plants were determined that other countries would not join their ranks but as coffee became a popular beverage in europe the stage was set for profit and portugal wanted a piece of the action enter francisco de mello palheta lt col in the brazilian army in  he was dispatched by his government to negotiate a border struggle with french guiana but his secret mission was to acquire coffee seedlings for brazil story has it that upon seeing how heavily guarded the coffee plantations were he abandoned the direct approach and instead set out to endear himself to the wife of the governor apparently he was successful with more than border negotiations as she presented him with a bouquet containing cuttings from coffee plants on the eve of his departure he planted these in brazil’s state of pará and in a relatively short time coffee cultivation had spread spread throughout the countryso much so that by the mid s brazil took the lead as a coffee producing country and at its peak during the s supplied almost  of the world’s coffee although this number has dropped as other countries’ exports have grown brazil still supplies  of the world’s coffee in brazil cuttingedge coffee research drives heavy production and most coffee plantations are huge—some covering  square miles the country’s coffeegrowing terrain lends itself to mechanization which is not the best news for specialty coffee as mechanization of picking and processing tends to reduce the quality of the end product also because much of brazil’s coffee is grown at lower altitudes and in nonvolcanic soil these differences come out in the cup as a lack of flavor and intensity that said there are some stellar brazilian offerings reaching the specialty coffee market which we seek out for cremaco a great cup of coffee from brazil carries a distinctive profile soft low in acidity nutty with bittersweet chocolate notes and distinct fruit brazil coffee colombia “ colombian coffee the richest in the world” remember the smiling and moustachioed juan valdez and his mule at the risk of bursting a few coffee bubbles ol’ juan was not a real person he was actually the clever brainchild of colombia’s federación nacional de cafeteros fnc more on juan and the fnc later but first a bit about how coffee cultivation came to colombia… stories vary but in most cases catholic priests get the credit for introducing coffee seeds to colombia ca  one tale has it that a certain father romero imposed upon parishioners the penance of planting coffee seeds in their backyards and soon coffee was growing in a lot of places what we do know for sure is that the country is rich in all the elements that make it prime coffeegrowing territory volcanic soils lush climate and altitude by the ’s large plantations of coffee began to change commerce in colombia and in  the farsighted coffee act law  began sponsoring coffee cultivation within  years coffee production went from  bags a year to more than  million making colombia second only to brazil as coffee exporter to the world back to the fnc created in  as a private nonprofit organization designed to defend the interests of coffee producers the fnc has been key not only in exportrelated fields but also in infrastructure juan valdez and his mule came along as an advertising campaign launched in the ’s hugely influential the fnc has become a somewhat unwieldy and sometimes difficult bureaucratic entity that tends to favor coffee quantity over quality yet still has impacted the lives of many subsistence farmers positively over the years but of course the specialty coffee world is concerned with quality and for us traceability is huge in colombia knowing exactly where a coffee comes from can be challenging and is made more difficult by the official colombian grading designations “supremo” and “excelso” refer not to quality but size and sorting for size often obscures the origin of the coffees cremaco roasters tend to work directly with larger farmers or farm collectives as well as with specific importers dedicated to finding and preserving quality microlots as a country colombia is no stranger to warfare most recently farc a guerilla organization has run counter to the government for  conflictfilled years a recent peace treaty has yet to be ratified but long before that ancient cultures rose to power flourished then faded now gods and mythical animals hang out in the mountains stone monuments to a civilization that faded circa  ad colombia coffee costa rica dig into costa rica’s past and the sheer weight of history weaves magic over this land of mountains valleys coastland verdant jungles and oftenactive volcanoes ten thousand years and more ago huntergatherers came into the area and little by little they began to settle building great stone cities creating mysterious granite spheres crafting gold and pottery the spanish relatively latecomers arrived in  and coffee didn’t take root in costa rica until the s but once it found the fertile soil perfect elevation and microclimates that national geographic calls the finest coffeegrowing region of the world coffee cultivation began to shape the country circa  the costa rican government began offering free land to coffee farmers and by  coffee revenues surpassed other crops at first beans were exported via panama to chile and relabeled “café chileno de valparaíso” but england soon became the largest prewwii importer of costa rican beans and costa rican coffee came into its own wealthy coffee barons rose to power mid s and into the s but ultimately a more democratic form of government brought about modernization railroads and education for both sexes in  the costa rican government ruled that all coffee grown in the country must be of the arabica variety though yields can be considerably less than robusta varieties this law has has made costa rica famous for coffee quality the country is currently the th largest coffee producer in the world and it is not coffee barons who turn out approximately  million bags of coffee a yearit is small farmers with an average of  hectares  acres of land apiece and hearts to coax the very best out of their holdings as a result traceability is usually readily available most costa rican coffees are identified by the farm finca on which they are grown the member cooperative or beneficio where they were processed the “ticos” take pride in their land and their coffee they have a phrase pura vida which encapsulates the optimism of the people this multipurpose phrase is translated “pure life” and carries with it an underlying thankfulness along with the understanding that no matter what the situation somewhere someone is experiencing something worse so maybe the situation isn’t so terrible after all in essence no matter how much or little you have life is short and we’re here together so—pura vida costa rica coffee el salvador coffee looks so peaceful in the cup fragrant evocative but its journey there has often been anything but this is especially true of coffee from el salvador “el grano de oro”the “grain of gold” came to el salvador near the end of the ’s and at first was only consumed in country a drink for the ones who grew it but before long the government started giving tax breaks and military exemption for coffee workers and eliminated export duties with these incentives coffee soon surpassed indigo as the nation’s leading export crop obviously this was good news for coffee drinkers the world over but it set the stage for coffee barons a class of wealthy landowning elitists who rose to power on the labor of the less priviliged thus for nearly  years the el salvadorian coffee scene has been one of conflict hardship and economic depression by the s the country had become the th largest coffee exporter on the globe but laborers still suffered under almost nonexistent wages few rights little recognition time and again the country was ripped by civil war as plantation owners and workers clashed interestingly though coffee cultivation led to the amassing of wealth for the few it also ultimately provided the golden ticket to reform fair trade cooperatives and human rights activists began to bring change and by the s over  of coffee farms were in the hands of small coffee producers through these cooperatives members obtain help in production sales and exporting as well as better prices for their coffee beans furthermore the years of conflict inadvertently preserved the more traditional coffee cultivars preventing replacement by higher yielding less flavorful sungrown hybrids el salvador’s oceaninfluenced climate and mild topography tends to produce softer less acidic coffees than neighboring countries but some very complex deep offerings reminiscent of the finest central american coffees are finding their way onto cupping tables most el salvadorian coffee is shade grown in addition some farmers are cultivating a pacamara hybrid often marketed under the name tizapalargebeaned and fascinating in that it surpasses both parent varieties in cup quality el salvador coffee guatemala the guatemalan coffee grading system defines the strictly hard bean shb grade to include “coffee beans grown at elevations higher than  feet  meters above sea level while the hard bean hb grade includes coffee beans grown between  feet and  feet  meters above sea level” the higher the elevation the slower the growth and ripening thus the denser the bean rendering it of higher quality guatemala coffee honduras honduran growers

world for coffee exports in  and the secondlargest exporter of arabica beans considering that coffee was slow to start up in this land of jungle and mountain even more impressive europeans brought coffee plants to the country in the late s the stage was set for the industry to blossom but bananas got in the way yes strange as it seems to coffee lovers bananas held sway as principal export crop for almost two centuries after the arrival of the first coffee plants over the years various presidents attempted to promote coffee as a commodity however large corporations controlled the banana industry and coffee production was mostly the realm of individual farmers it wasn’t until the mid’s that coffee cultivation became widespread in honduras widespread yes but prices for coffee were so low that growers would often smuggle their beans across the border into guatemala to sell at a better price in addition lack of infrastructure has meant that many farmers continue to process and dry their coffee themselves and mix these small lots together to sell to exporters it sounds neighborly but the results can be disappointing flavorwise in  just as a number of coffee farmers and exporters were finding their way into the american specialty coffee market honduras was devastated first by hurricane mitch and then by the storms and floods of  devastating  of the nation’s agriculture since then new export taxes incentives for coffee farmers and improved roads and infrastructures have been changing the coffee industry cooperatives support from the instituto hondureño del café ihcafe protected origin denomination and notoriety gained by cup of excellence winning coffees all are helping to awaken the world to the excellent coffees coming out of honduras yes honduras has battled hardship disasters and violence but coffee is helping to make a difference in fact there is an active program for young gang members who are caught in a round of violence and poverty in this coffee vs gangs program they learn how to grow coffee manage a farm and carry on exporting business the next generation of coffee growers is taking shape through family farms and programs such as this no wonder hondurans are proud of their coffee honduras coffee mexico coffee trees love the temperate zone so it was only logical that some beans journeyed to mexico from the antilles in the closing years of the s stories vary but juan antonio garcía is credited with bringing coffee cultivation to the country through the port of veracruz while an italian by the name of geronimo manchinelli helped establish coffee in the chiapas region near the border of guatemala early on wealthy settlers purchased large tracts of land for coffee plantations great news for coffee but bad for the indigenous people many of whom ultimately ended up working on the plantations mexico began sharing its coffee with the world especially to consumers in europe in the late s roughly  years passed along with a few laws and in  land was redistributed back to the people who in turn used their acquired coffeegrowing expertise on their own small farms again good news for coffee inmecafe instituto mexicano del cafe’ came on the scene in  to provide technical and financial assistance to growers and to facilitate the international coffee agreement  with these aids coffee production in mexico exploded in some rural areas increasing by nearly  but then oil prices plummeted the country began defaulting on its loans and inmecafe came to a grinding halt farmers could get no credit predatory coffee brokers”coyotes”bought coffee beans from farmers for pennies and resold at profit soon growers could no longer afford fertilizers pest protection or resources for farm management and production dropped some smallholders stopped harvesting their coffee completely ultimately this crisis birthed cooperatives with collective power to purchase and maintain mills lobby for rights and develop direct trade relationships with buyers these days mexico is the one of the largest producers of coffee in the world and the largest coffee trade partner with the us yet of the  states that grow coffee most aren’t even known by name this is due in part to the fact that only about  of mexico’s coffee is considered specialty grade but with the advent of the cup of excellence competition coffee farmers are taking more interest in the quality of their coffee not just the quantity coffee aficionados project that we’ll be tasting a new generation of flavors in the future and learning some new names from the mexican coffee scene mexico coffee nicaragua it is said that in nicaragua everyone is considered a poet until proven otherwise certainly this land with its misty jungles cloudcovered volcanoes its mountain lakes and streams inspires poetry but it also gives rise to great coffee in fact coffee is the main export from nicaragua  of the country’s agricultural jobs are in coffee production and more than  families depend solely upon coffee for their main income yet it has only been cultivated here for a relatively short  years  years before columbus landed in  people lived in what is now the nation of nicaragua creating cities trade routes civilizations a mere  years ago conquistadores founded their own cities and  years later coffee arrived on the scene courtesy of catholic missionaries grown at first more as a curiosity than a possible cash crop by  coffee had become nicaragua’s principal export and for the next  years coffee cultivation boomed helped by government incentive programs and coffee cooperatives but in  the country became a battleground between communists and contras and the coffee industry was caught in the crossfire coffee transports and workers were attacked mills sabotaged then hurricane mitch hit in  devastating agriculture coffee prices plummeted between  and to top it off drought hit the nation thankfully nicaragua is emerging from these dark times democratic elections are bringing stability and some great things are happening in the coffee sector these days most coffee is grown in three regions jinotega matagalpa and segovia predominately shadegrown it carries a fragrant complex profile with medium body and acidity and hints of nut and vanilla along with citrus top notes many nicaraguan farmers have never actually cupped their own coffees but this is changing in pursuit of a more excellent product farmers are setting up tasting labs on site as well as improving cultivation and processing practices despite the hardships they have faced the nicaraguan people are “muy sympatico”very pleasant and they genuinely care about the quality of the coffees they grow not just individually but for nicaragua as a whole as one coop leader expressed “producing quality coffee just like working to improve people’s quality of life is the responsibilidad de todos responsibility of everyone” smallholders and their coops are working together to show the world that coffee from nicaragua is something special and they take this cooperation seriously nicaragua coffee panama you might say that love brought the first coffee plants to panama when a retired english sea captain married a panamanian lady circa  he brought coffee seedlings with him before long other colonists planted arabica varieties in the volcanic highlands of panama and coffee cultivation took firm root many of these first coffee farmers were engineers and managers from europe who had relocated during the construction of the panama canal their extensive knowledge of agriculture and experience dealing with commerce helped establish coffee farming in panama on a more scientific level than was the norm this narrow country bordered on the north by nicaragua and on the south by costa rica is home to the highest inactive volcanoes in central america the altitude and the influence of both atlantic and pacific oceans create microclimates which combined with rich volcanic soils make for perfect coffee growing conditions because of this coffee seeds from all over the world have been brought here for cultivation and observation among these is “geisha” gesha coffee an ethiopian strain of arabica with a very distinctive taste profilefloral fruity and highly sought after biodiversity is valued highly in panama much of its coffee is grown beneath the canopy of native rainforest water sources and animal habitat are protected as farmers combine their traditional growing and milling practices with innovative technologies in cultivation and processing many of the seasonal workers who help with coffee harvest are of the ngäbes ngobes people who originally occupied panama before the coming of columbus since no machines can be used to harvest the ripened cherries these skilled workers are integral to the success of the panamanian coffee industry they alternate between their ancestral holdings in the comarca area and the coffee farms of costa rica and panama bringing with them their culture their art and the expertise so key to specialty coffee production panamanian growers are wellversed in coffee quality cupping and grading their beans with confidence and able to recommend profiles to buyers and price their coffees correctly growers here also have the advantage of functional infrastructure with the panama canal and accessible ports shipping is easy and within the country travel to farms is for the most part accomplished on excellent roads the best of panama competitions and subsequent coffee auctions are drawing increased attention from international specialty coffee buyers as they come to taste and to acquire the distinctive coffees of the panamanian highlands panama coffee peru peru is a land of mistdrenched mountains ancient incan ruins and giant mysterious patterns on the plains for thousands of years the moche nazca and inca people were engineers builders skilled metal workers weavers and warriors stories of their silver and gold eventually brought the conquistadores looking for treasure and in due process of time the first coffee seeds arrived story has it that dutch immigrants arriving in the northern port of pacasmayo ca  brought with them coffee seedsseedlings and planted them in the chinchao district of huánuco province of northern peru it was a fortuitous event for both the country and eventually the world because nutrientrich soils abundant rainfall and ideal elevation welcomed that first coffee endeavor and before long cultivation spread north and south wherever conditions were favorable peru had its first coffee shop as early as  but it wasn’t until  that it began exporting the magic bean here on the lush slopes of the andes many of the older farms and smallholders continue to cultivate the original varieties brought by the early settlers most farmers are of incan descent with spanish as their second language except for the areas closer to the pacific coast farms tend to be hours from the nearest electricity and indoor plumbing winding onetrack roads clinging to mountainsides rendered perilous by rain and mud make travel by vehicle challenging and most farmers don’t own a vehicle anyway this lack of infrastructure translates into transporting cherries to the nearest milloften hours awayor using hand pulpers and onsite wood fermentation tanks farmers transport their beans to market by foot horseback or mule to the nearest townanywhere from  minutes to a full day’s journey from the farm for these remote areas coffee is sold on saturdays after which farmers buy supplies and head back up the foot trails to their farms unfortunately prices at these markets can be disappointingly low a situation made worse in the s by guerrilla activity of the shining path communist group which often destroyed crops and drove farmers from their lands these days about a fourth of the  small producers belong to cooperatives which among other benefits enables them to earn fair trade certification and more equal pay for their coffee much of peru’s coffee is shadegrown often organically though most farmers can’t afford to become certified though in the past producers have been disconnected from the end product many are increasingly understanding the connection between their efforts and the beverage in the cup as this happens their vision for quality continues to grow peru coffee africa burundi coffee dr congo coffee ethiopia coffee kenya coffee malawi coffee rwanda coffee tanzania coffee zambia coffee asia  oceania indonesia coffee papua new guinea coffee

sponsorsadvertisers list of reviews kansas city pages kc travel guide for uscc competition kansas city coffee guide my brewing methods media appearances  feb  coffee subscription review cremaco by kccoffeegeek  posted in reviews   writer consultant and coffee goddess emily mcintyre was one of the first people to really help me out when i first started kccoffeegeekcom at the time she was working for one of my favorite coffee roasters in portland or and emily helped pave the way for me to work with a bunch of other roasters out there since then she and her husband have started catalyst coffee consulting and she is also the director of operations for the relatively new coffee subscription service cremaco emily recently asked me to check out cremaco and see what i think and what i found is well worth sharing with readers tldr version cremaco is one of the best laidout easy to use and functional websites i’ve seen the shipping was great and the selection of roasters and coffees is awesome couldn’t ask for anything more and it’s an a cremaco sets a high bar for coffee subscriptions it seems like these days you can’t throw a rock without hitting a coffee subscription service almost every roaster has some subscription option and there is certainly no shortage of subscriptions that handle multiple roasters too so what if anything makes cremaco stand apart from the others let’s find out cremaco was founded by tyler tate who imagined a coffee marketplace that facilitated getting great coffee into drinkers’ hands but would also tell the important story behind every coffee and farmer with help from software engineer bryan rahbein and my friend emily they turned cremaco into a kickstarter campaign raising over  in april  after a private beta to test things out cremaco officially launched in december of  in full disclosure emily gave me a  credit so i could try out cremaco without any outofpocket expenses so armed with my  bucks i headed for the internet actually the “you have a gift” email from emily that alerted me to the fact that i had a credit at cremaco was the only hiccup in the whole process i use gmail and the email went directly into my “promotions” tab i don’t know why but i almost never check my social and promotions tabs in gmail don’t even get me started about the spam junk and clutter folders on outlook which i have to use for work and so my only concern would be people missing a gift from cremaco’s website because of this the crema website has a nice clean modern look that will look very familiar to anyone who peruses coffee websites once in a while the top menu is wellorganized and simple allowing you to link to coffees roasters or give a gift in the upper right corner you have your login and your brewlist which is crema’s way of organizing your coffees sort of like your playlist for bean juice if it matters i did all my playing around on the website on a fully updated apple mac mini using safari as my browser once i log in the site takes me automatically to the page that would open if you clicked the “coffees” link in the top menu bar i’m able to explore coffees by roast level light medium dark geography and even certification usda organic fair trade certified direct trade and of course the original links i mentioned that allow me to go to roasters and coffees are still live at the top of the page the coffee selections are nicely laid out in a grid and the whole site is beautifully responsive so as i make my browser window bigger or smaller the photos and layout change accordingly too awesome really each coffee in the grid has a photo of the farmers or the farm a clearly marked name a few flavor descriptors the price and size of the bag you’d get an “add to brewlist button” and a very clear logo in the corner of who the coffee roaster is i couldn’t ask for a cleaner interface or a better layout for this part of the site there are even little touches like on the above page when i hover my mouse pointer over a coffee the selection background darkens and the roast level pops up under the roaster logo just so you know which coffee you’re hovering over the screenshot below shows what i mean where the first coffee on the left of the screen is the one my mouse is hovering over in the photo finally on this page coffees that have particular certifications also have special icons twoway arrows for direct trade usda organic logo for organic and what looks like a little human for fair trade so you know what if any certifications the coffee carries anything that has already been added to my brewlist is also indicated clearly as such the roasters link at the top menu bar takes you to a page of logos of all the current roasters on cremaco the current roaster list is awesome… bold bean you know i love those guys nossa familia whose coffee i just reviewed yesterday toby’s estate paradise coffee roasters one village coffee villa myriam onyx coffee lab you know i love those guys too and james coffee co clicking on a roaster opens the link to the roaster’s page within cremaco and it is so well thought out i can hardly stand it for an information addict like me this is perfection you have a nice photo of the roaster’s place the logo links to their website facebook twitter instagram and any other social media outlets location on earth contact info oh my there is some back story on the roaster and then a quick scroll down shows you all the coffees currently available from that roaster want something from onyx but you’re not sure what all they have available through crema right now this is your first stop now let’s talk about this brewlist at least on my mac and using safari when i find a coffee that looks interesting and click the “add to brewlist” button for that coffee a little animation shows the coffee being dragged and dropped into the little brewlist icon in the upper right corner clicking the brewlist icon causes the site to shift to the left while a sidebar opens up on the right side of the screen revealing my current list there is sooooo much i like about the brewlist view above too as you can see i don’t have enough credit to get my next coffee so my list is in suspension and i can add my preferred payment method right from here as you would expect i also received an email from cremaco telling me this was happening which is a nice reminder you can see my list when each coffee in the list is scheduled to ship and also very nicely at the bottom you see “ship every…” with a drop down menu for  days week  days  weeks  weeks month there is also a “pause” button there in the event that you want to pause your shipments let’s say you’ll be in bora bora for a couple weeks just pause it and leave when you’re in the airport to fly home on your private jet just open the site unpause and the shipments will pick up where they left off sweet in case you were wondering yes you can drag and drop each selection in your brewlist to easily rearrange it so if i decide i want james coffee’s honduras next instead of the nicaragua santa lucila i can just drag it to the top of the list i can also remove coffees from my list with the click of the “remove” link everything you need is right there i get occasional emails from crema when new coffees andor roasters are added and i also get alerts via email when a coffee is sold out these are automatically removed from my brewlist so i don’t have to manage anything along those lines it’s all done by crema even the emails are well thought out and the subject line has most of the info you need so if you’re the kind of person who reads a subject line and then deletes an email before you even open it you can be “that guy” and not lose any sleep over it lol adding shipping info credit card information claiming a gift etc are all clear and easy to do i cannot overemphasize how well designed and implemented crema’s interface is emily’s storytelling for each coffee and farmer is wonderful and the only challenge to any of this is figuring out which coffees you want next the shipping is prompt and fast and the boxes are a nice presentation even too i truly liked everything about my cremaco experience without overstating one bit cremaco sets the benchmark for what a multiroaster subscription service should look like what information the website should have and the functionality of using it all online they have set the bar very high and i love it share thisclick to email this to a friend opens in new windowclick to share on facebook opens in new windowclick to

resources future trendsto date the company has not made any profits and is still a “development stage company” while some financial resources have come from operations these only provide a fraction of

company has not issued any securities since inception other than common stock issued to the foundersvaluationthe company determined the valuation cap discount and interest rate of the crowd notes in this offering internally based on its own assessment of the companys current and future value as well as relative risk for investors investing in similarly situated companies the crowd notes may convert to equity securities of the company in the future if the company engages in future equity financings at that time the valuation of the company will be determined through negotiations with prospective investors those prospective investors may determine the value of the company through one or multiple methods which includeliquidation value — the amount for which the assets of the company can be sold minus the liabilities owed book value — this is based on analysis of the company’s financial statements usually looking at the company’s balance sheet andearnings approach — this is based on what the prospective investor will pay the present value for what the prospective investor expects to obtain in the futuremarket landscapethe us coffee market was  billion in  according to the specialty coffee association of america cremaco is targeting the  billion home and  billion office segments with a particular focus on the specialty subcomponent of each estimated to be  billion and  million respectively for a total addressable market of  billion in the uspremiumization trendmuch like craft beer before it the last few years have seen a gentrification of coffee its even been given a name thirdwave coffee distinguishing it from the stuff out of a tin can first wave and the ubiquity of national chains second wave fanatical attention to quality a cultivation of connoisseurship and an emphasis on traceability and sustainability are central values to the third wave movement and its millennial coffee drinkers and artisanal roasters who are the driving forces behind this premiumization “the latest data shows a market shift toward highquality premium beverages with younger demographics driving this change” the national coffee association nca wrote in a recent blog postthe shift has been a dramatic one “between  and ” the nca found “pastday consumption of gourmet coffee beverages soared from  to  among  year olds and from  to  for those ”market response  consolidationin response to coffees shift upmarket craft roasters have received renewed attention—for instance san franciscos blue bottle coffee attracted over  million in venture capital according to crunchbase—and large coffee companies have either launched new initiatives or made acquisitions to enter this growing segment howard schultz announced late last year for instance that he was stepping down as starbucks ceo to focus on opening more starbucks reserve stores which he described as “a new premium retail coffee format offering customers the finest assortment of exclusive microlot coffees sourced from around the world”other coffee giants have made acquisitions to ensure their seat at the thirdwave table jab holdings a private equity firm which has rapidly consolidated the worlds largest coffee empire acquired stumptown coffee roasters portland and intelligentsia coffee chicago two thirdwave darlings in late  through peets coffee and tea a jab subsidiary the rational given by dave burwick peets ceo is telling “as the super premium coffee category further explodes and fragments due to more consumers –yearolds demanding variety and highly specialized coffee experiences it’s important that we offer differentiated craft coffee brands with unique propositions and appeal”in response to these acquisitions ross colbert a beverage strategist at rabobank international told the wall street journal “we can expect further consolidation among toptier craft roasters in coffee like beer small is beautiful”cremas approachour approach embodies the values of the thirdwave movement discovery of artisan roasters appreciation of quality and subtlety and commitment to sustainability all underpinned with authentic storytelling our insight is that the way to succeed with the modern coffee drinker is not to take one product and make it ubiquitous but rather provide a platform through which many curated products from craft brands can be savored and become a trusted ally in the coffee drinkers own journey of connoisseurshiprisks and disclosureswe are selling convertible notes that will convert into shares or result in payment in limited circumstances these notes do not have a maturity date and only convert or result in payment in limited circumstances  if there is a merger buyout or other corporate transaction that occurs before a qualified equity financing investors will receive a payment of the greater of two times their purchase price or the amount of preferred shares they would have been able to purchase using the valuation cap  if there is a qualified equity financing an initial public offering registered under the securities act or a financing using preferred shares the notes will convert into a yet tobedetermined class of preferred stock the notes will convert at a discount of  or based on a valuation cap meaning investors would be rewarded for taking on early risk compared to later investors but you won’t know how much your investment is worth until that happens the outside investors at the time of conversion if any might value the company at an amount well below the  million valuation cap so you should not view the  million as being an indication of the company’s value further the interest on the notes is accrued interest therefore you will not receive interest payments on these notes  if you choose to invest you should be prepared that your notes will never convert and will have no value we have not assessed the tax implications of using the crowd note the crowd note is a type of debt security that does not include a set maturity date and is not interest bearing as such there has been inconsistent treatment under state and federal tax law as to whether the crowd note can be considered a debt of the company or the issuance of equity investors should consult their tax advisersany valuation at this stage is difficult to assess unlike listed companies that are valued publicly through marketdriven stock prices the valuation of private companies especially startups is difficult to assess and you may risk overpaying for your investment in addition there may be additional classes of equity with rights that are superior to the class of equity being soldthe crowd note contains dispute resolution provisions which limit your ability to bring class action lawsuits or seek remedy on a class basis by purchasing a crowd note this offering you agree to be bound by the dispute resolution provisions found in section  of the crowd note  those provisions apply to claims regarding this offering the crowd notes and possibly the securities into which the crowd note are convertible under those provisions disputes under the crowd note will be resolved in arbitration conducted in delaware  further those provisions may limit your ability to bring class action lawsuits or similarly seek remedy on a class basis you may have limited rights the company has not yet authorized preferred stock and there is no way to know what voting rights those securities will have  in addition as an investor in the regulation cf offering you will be considered a nonmajor investor under the terms of the notes offered and therefore you have more limited information rights and you will not have the right to automatically participate in future offerings and therefore not have the same antidilution protections as major investorsyou will be bound by an investment management agreement which limits your voting rights as a result of purchasing the notes all nonmajor investors including all investors investing under regulation cf will be bound by an investment management agreement this agreement will limit your voting rights and at a later time may require you to convert your future preferred shares into common shares without your consent nonmajor investors will be bound by this agreement unless nonmajor investors holding a majority of the principal amount outstanding of the crowd notes or majority of the shares of the preferred equity the notes will convert into vote to terminate the agreementthe reviewing cpa has issued included a “going concern” note in the reviewed financials we may not have enough funds to sustain the business until it becomes profitable even if we raise funds through a crowdfunding round we may not accurately anticipate how quickly we may use the funds and if it is sufficient to bring the business to profitabilityyou can’t easily resell the securities there are restrictions on how you can resell your securities for the next year more importantly there is no market for these securities and there might never be one it’s unlikely that the company will ever go public or get acquired by a bigger company that means the money you paid for these securities could be tied up for a long timethis is an early stage company it has limited history clients and revenues if you are investing in this company it’s because you think this is a good idea that the founders can execute it better than their competition that they can price products right and sell it to enough people that the company will succeed you are taking all these things on faith because it’s impossible to know what will happen we are dependent upon additional capital resources for the continuation of our principal operations and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure funding to reach a stage when we profitably operate the businessthe company has realized significant operating losses to date and expects to incur losses in the future the company has operated at a loss since inception and these losses are likely to continue our net loss for  was   and the net loss for  was   until the company achieves profitability it will have to seek other sources of capital in order to continue operationswe have a small management team we depend on the skills and experience of our cofounders and management who are both integral to the business if the company is not able to call upon them for any reason its operations and development could be harmedthe online coffee market is a crowded place there is a lot of activity in the online coffee sales space—many different coffee roasters or ‘coffee curators’ are selling coffee subscriptions similar to ours the market has not yet seen significant consolidation and no leaders have emerged so far we believe that our offering and business strategy will help us capture a significant portion of the marketplace but there is no guarantee this will happen it is possible that one or more of our competitors will be more successful which could negatively impact our potential for growth and ability to turn a profitsome of our competitors have significantly more resources than we do some of our competitors are clearly established large coffee companies such as starbucks and blue bottle these big companies have significantly more resources at their disposal than we do and there is a chance that they will be able to squeeze out smaller companies like ours from the online coffee marketplacethe market trends we are anticipating in the specialty coffee industry may not happen there is no guarantee that predictions on growth in the gourmet subcomponent of the coffee market outpacing the growth of the market as a whole particularly among millennials will continue while we have seen significant growth in specialty coffee consumption in the past few years you cannot be sure that these trends will continue or that we will be able to capture a larger percentage of the market general risks and disclosuresstartup investing is risky investing in startups is very risky highly speculative and should not be made by anyone who cannot afford to lose their entire investment unlike an investment in a mature business where there is a track record of revenue and income the success of a startup or earlystage venture often relies on the development of a new product or service that may or may not find a market before investing you should carefully consider the specific risks and disclosures related to both this offering type and the company which can be found in this company profile and the documents in the data room belowyour shares are not easily transferable you should not plan on being able to readily transfer andor resell your security currently there is no market or liquidity for these shares and the company does not have any plans to list these shares on an exchange or other secondary market at some point the company may choose to do so but until then you should plan to hold your investment for a significant period of time before a “liquidation event” occurs a “liquidation event” is when the company either lists their shares on an exchange is acquired or goes bankruptthe company may not pay dividends for the foreseeable future unless otherwise specified in the offering documents and subject to state law you are not entitled to receive any dividends on your interest in the company accordingly any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends or income from an investment should not purchase any of the securities offered on the sitevaluation and capitalization unlike listed companies that are valued publicly through marketdriven stock prices the valuation of private companies especially startups is difficult to assess and you may risk overpaying for your investment in addition there may be additional classes of equity with rights that are superior to the class of equity being soldyou may only receive limited disclosure while the company must disclose certain information since the company is at an earlystage they may only be able to provide limited information about its business plan and operations because it does not have fully developed operations or a long history the company may also only obligated to file information periodically regarding its business including financial statements a publicly listed company in contrast is required to file annual and quarterly reports and promptly disclose certain events — through continuing disclosure that you can use to evaluate the status of your investmentinvestment in personnel an earlystage investment is also an investment in the entrepreneur or management of the company being able to execute on the business plan is often an important factor in whether the business is viable and successful you should be aware that a portion of your investment may fund the compensation of the company’s employees including its management you should carefully review any disclosure regarding the company’s use of proceedspossibility of fraud in light of the relative ease with which earlystage companies can raise funds it may be the case that certain opportunities turn out to be moneylosing fraudulent schemes as with other investments there is no guarantee that investments will be immune from fraudlack of professional guidance many successful companies partially attribute their early success to the guidance of professional earlystage investors eg angel investors and venture capital firms these investors often negotiate for seats on the company’s board of directors and play an important role through their resources contacts and experience in assisting earlystage companies in executing on their business plans an earlystage company may not have the benefit of such professional investorscremacos form cthe form c is a document the company must file with the securities and exchange
