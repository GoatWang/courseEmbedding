real estate founded  headquarters oak brook illinois website httpinlandinvestmentscominlandresidentialtrust inland residential properties trust inc residential properties trust is a nontraded real estate investment trust reit sponsored by affiliates of oak brook illinoisbased the inland group the trust was founded in december  and started selling common stock on february   residential properties trust will invest in stabilized class a and b multifamily properties in the top  metropolitan statistical areas in the united states residential properties trust is a nontraded reit which is a company whose shares are not listed on an exchange the shares therefore have limited or no liquidity residential properties trust will be managed by external managers who charge fees or commissions when the trust buys holds or sells real estate external managers for residential properties trust are controlled by affiliates of the inland group and charge fees paid to inland affiliates in this respect the trust’s structure shares similarities with the initial setup of its sister vehicle inland american real estate trust now known as inventrust properties corporation inland american shareholders have been charged  billion in relatedparty fees a march  wall street journal article described inland american as a “zombie reit” noting its failure to unwind the plunge in value of its holdings and the drastic cut to shareholder distributions all of residential properties trust’s executive officers staff or direct at least one of its external managers and they also split their time acting as directors or staff of other inland vehicles in its sec filings the company disclosed that residential properties trust’s officers will have conflicts of interest due to the competing demands for the time they spend between different funds and that these might lead to them violating their fiduciary duties the sec filings further acknowledge that the trust’s external managers will face conflicts of interest because of their compensation arrangements such actions could include purchasing assets that are not in shareholders’ best interests or negotiating higher purchase prices for assets than they otherwise would if they were not compensated based on the purchase price among other things contents  fund management  fees  competition for deals  apartment reit sector  notes  external links fund managementedit in contrast to most publiclytraded reits residential properties trust relies completely on external managers it has no paid staff and is managed by five executive officers who all staff or direct one or more of the trust’s feebased external advisors the external advisors are owned by the inland group and extract fees or commissions when residential properties trust buys holds or sells real estate due to this setup the fund has inherent conflicts of interest the external advisors are tasked with running the business of the trust including selecting potential real estate investments negotiating contracts managing properties and advising the board of directors on asset acquisitions and sales among other things in return they will earn fees through schedules laid out in agreements with residential properties trust the contracts were not negotiated at arm’slength for example mitchell sabshon is the ceo president and a director of residential property trust he is also the president and ceo of residential property trust’s business manager and a director of the trust’s dealer manager the business manager receives acquisition fees real estate sales commissions and a host of other fees for its activities the dealer manager receives commissions and fees on every share investors buy residential properties trust’s structure is very similar to the initial structure of inland american at inland american relatedparty transactions have contributed to litigation and regulatory scrutiny these include a finding of breach of fiduciary duty by inland american’s special litigation committee a subpoena by the illinois securities division and problems regarding its securities renewal in california inland american withdrew its request for
