ogp on facebook  nil zacharias cofounder  editorinchief one green planet february  0 i sensed it the moment i stepped inside sweet earth natural food’s  square foot facility in moss landing california it was almost instant undeniable and omnipresent i’m not referring to the smell of spicy hickory and sage smoked “benevolent bacon” and burritos lingering in the air although that was great too what i’m talking about is a positive vibe that encapsulates the place and the people that work there i wondered was it the quintessential california location after all sweet earth is located along an idyllic stretch of highway one on the california central coast one of the most abundant agricultural regions in the world with the crashing waves of the pacific ocean merely a stone’s throw away or was there more to it   sweet earth’s website proclaims that the most important ingredients are ones they don’t list on the package “sweet vibes” “rolling surf” and “pure sunshine” within minutes spent at sweet earth’s hq it became clear that the “sweet vibes” was not just clever branding by a couple of seasoned marketing executives coo brian swette was board chairman of burger king cmo at pepsi and coo at ebay and ceo kelly swette held senior marketing roles at calvin klein and pepsi from the smiling employees to the energy and enthusiasm of the swette’s themselves this place seemed genuinely infused with positivity and passion for food from the labs of burger king and pepsi to the farms of california wikimedia  “we value tradition over science” said the swette’s as they explained the philosophy behind what sweet earth is trying to do not words you would expect from a couple that built their very successful careers in companies like burger king and pepsi both giant food corporations that grew their bottom line without much regard for the environment or human health but the way the swette’s see it everything they did in their careers and their lives before sweet earth lead up to this very moment they realized that something had to change in the food industry and they could either wait for it to happen or help to propel the change themselves brian has always been interested in sustainability he is on the board of directors of arizona state university’s global institute of sustainability and kelly on the other hand was passionate about nutrition health and food so three years ago this husband and wife team decided to combine these interests and dedicate their energy to sweet earth which they proudly refer to as their “legacy project” the emphasis on sweet vibes and real foods could easily mislead some into believing that sweet earth is merely the couple’s way of giving back after incredibly successful careers in the corporate world and while creating products that are environmentally friendly and nutritious is what drives the swette’s the natural and plantbased food space also happens to be going through an incredible phase of growth as the leading online publication on the forefront of the conscious consumerism and sustainable food movements we here at one green planet have written extensively about this growth and how we are in the midst of an important shift that will forever transform the future of food in america and potentially across the world conscious consumerism with food choices at the fore is not just challenging outmoded food habits and trends but currently redefining entire industries we get millions of visitors flocking to one green planet every month hungry to learn about how to make healthier and more sustainable food choices and we know this is just indicative of a much larger trend meat consumption in the us has been in steady decline over the past few decades driven by reasons ranging from health concerns over animal welfare to environmental factors recent studies estimate that nearly onethird of americans roughly  million people are consciously choosing to keep meat off their plates more often and millennials are transforming the american consumer marketplace by demanding fresh healthy and plantbased options yet americans want more protein in their diets so the question is how are they getting this while keeping meat off their plates you guessed it products offered by companies like sweet earth naturals beyond meat and others so while sweet earth’s food may be the antithesis of what burger king and pepsi have been selling to the public for years the company’s mission still makes very good business sense the future of protein nprorg  meat at least the kind that actually comes from an animal and other animal products are starting to face some stiff competition in the grocery aisles from plantbased products that aspire to replicate the exact taste and texture of meat to testtube burgers and even veggie burgers that bleed the race is undoubtedly on to develop the protein of the future venture capitalists are pumping millions of dollars into businesses that are trying to make good on the promise of recreating the taste texture and nutrition of animal meat minus all the health problems environmental destruction and cruelty my recent conversations with ethan brown from beyond meat josh tetrick from hampton creek and now the swette’s have only further solidified my belief that we are collectively not just part of a new trend or a passing fad but a real movement by having the ability to influence and shape the food choices of millions of americans we stand at the precipice of a tremendous opportunity one that offers us a real glimmer of hope for a more sustainable and healthy future  sweet earth is playing a part in this movement in their own unique way “we’re not trying to create fake foods” explains brian “we want to focus on authentic ancient proteins that stand the test of time” sweet earth’s products feature combinations of nutrientdense vegetables proteinrich grains seeds and legumes all topped with herbs and exotic spices like za’atar “we have a passion for cooking and want to take people on culinary adventures” says kelly “that’s why we incorporate bold global flavors that can surprise and delight people who are yearning for high quality healthier alternatives that don’t compromise on taste”  i tried a few of their products and noticed that protein is a dominant nutrient and a focus on flavor seems to be a consistent theme their “righteous meats” product line includes an array of interesting plantbased protein options in fact their tuscan savory grounds are one of the most flavorful plantbased grounds i’ve tasted but what i found especially interesting is that sweet earth’s frozen burritos are currently their most popular product the breakfast foods market is undergoing a significant and muchneeded shift at the moment as consumers move away from sugary cereals and processed carbs to foods that are convenient to eat onthego and high in healthy protein armed with breakfast burritos sweet earth has a very exciting opportunity to disrupt the entire category projected to reach  billion by  winning hearts and tastebuds in the grocery aisles the swette’s are onto something not only do they understand that americans’ interest in global flavors is increasing they know that consumers want leaner healthier greener protein sources in convenient packages while we should continue to encourage people to slow down shop for fresh produce and prepare homecooked meals the reality is that in today’s faced paced world convenience is indispensable but what if every time someone tried to make a convenient choice they didn’t have to compromise on taste or nutrition imagine the impact on the health of our nation where  percent of the population are obese and  percent are overweight imagine the impact on the environment kelly swette acknowledges that their goal is incredibly challenging but believes that sweet earth’s authentic commitment to offering real flavorful nutrientdense foods at an affordable price point makes them tough to beat in the packaged food space   sweet earth seems to be in the early stages of its evolution from a laid back natural food company to a national food brand but how easy will that leap be in other words can sweet earth really help transform people’s perceptions of food their eating habits and their health moreover can they stay true to their focus on simplicity and  sustainability and yet become a real contender in the future of the food industry  there’s no debating that the future of food will be shaped by companies that are bold enough to try and my guess is with the swette’s at the helm and “sweet vibes” under their sails sweet earth undoubtedly stands a fighting chance lead image source sweet earth natural foods do you have a business that is a game

scaramucci’s wife has reportedly filed for divorcecourtesy sweet earth foodsentrepreneursfrom burger king chair to naturalfoods mavenanne fisherjul  brian swette’s resume reads like a who’s who of huge american consumergoods companies a former chief operating officer and head of marketing at ebay he was chief marketing officer of pepsico’s beverage division and a brand manager at procter  gamble before taking the nonexecutive board chairman seat at burger kingso what was he doing in march 0 tramping across strawberry fields in moss landing calif to break into an empty warehouse“we needed a place to manufacture our products which we were making in a small kitchen in a storefront” recalls swette pronounced sweetie “i saw this building in the middle of miles of farmland that i heard was in foreclosure i had to break the lock on the door to look inside but it was perfect for us”six months later the squarefoot space opened its doors as sweet earth natural foods’ new factoryit’s a long way from burger king the company launched in late 0 makes allnatural vegetarian foods including veggie burgers burritos and a new line of something called benevolent bacon made of buckwheat red beans vital wheat gluten and  spices “it’s earth friendly heart healthy and crueltyfree” swette says “i’ve always had an interest in sustainability this business is redemption for me”it’s also growing like mad sweet earth started with just swette and his wife and cofounder kelly swette formerly a pepsico marketing executive and then head of global marketing for calvin klein the startup now has 0 employees and swette says a  monthly run rate he expects to reach  million by year’s endwhat would swette advise aspiring entrepreneurs about quitting the executive suite to start their own ventures he says he’s learned three big things from his experienceit’s a lot harder than you think “this isn’t the hardest thing i’ve ever done” says swette “but it comes pretty darn close in the corporate world people talk about hard choices but every decision is magnified in a small company where you have no backup and no history there’s a lot more ambiguity”he especially misses having a human resources department recently swette came up with a plan to give all sweet earth’s employees many of whom are native spanishlanguage speakers some equity in the company “i had to figure that out myself then get it translated into spanish and present it” he says he then had to deal with employees’ initial suspicion “they were skeptical like ‘why is he giving us something for nothing there must be a catch’” swette says “i really could have used some help with that”everything is handson “in a big company you spend most of your time in meetings but with a startup your survival is based on action” says swette in his old job as a top marketing executive at pepsico he recalls “i would set strategy and once in a while go along on a sales call” now he knows every distributor that carries sweet earth products and answers their emails himself“most consumer goods managers don’t taste their products or see them made every day” he adds “we do” he’s also haggled with suppliers picked up a hammer to fix a recalcitrant machine on the factory floor and driven a delivery truckthink fast turning that abandoned warehouse in moss landing into a running factory in just six months “could never have happened in a large company” says swette “but in a startup you can move quickly and make adjustments on the fly in fact you have to”benevolent bacon for example took just a few months to develop from prototype to store shelves it’s in 0 stores now swette says and will be in about 0 by the end of “in a big company a new product would take twice that long just to get to test markets and that’s with a huge staff and lots of support” he says “here it’s usually kelly and i and maybe one other person cooking up different versions of a new product in our kitchen at home until three in the morning”swette has no regrets about exchanging the boardroom for the burrito business but he does sometimes miss the executive perks he once took for granted “big companies’ private jets are overrated” he says “but the middle seat in coach on a nofrills airline is really a drag”customer servicesite mapprivacy policyadvertisingad choicesterms of useyour california privacy rightscareers

march  0  am sweet earth natural foods over the past three years kelly and brian swette have grown their modest company into a 0 million business building mainstream appeal when veteran consumer products marketer brian swette turned entrepreneur four years ago building an organic vegetarian food business was the farthest thing from his mindmaybe a boutique hotel or a restaurant thought swette pronounced “sweetie” a 0yearold former pepsico executive ebay coo and burger king chairman some more advisory positions perhapsbut nothing seemed quite right until his wife and business partner kelly and his vegetarian daughter planted the seed for sweet earth natural foods“it was an environmental epiphany” he saidjust three years later the pacific grove calif company has blossomed into a 0 million business the organic food purveyor recently recorded its first  monthsweet earth’s frozen burritos and veggie burgers are sold nationally by target and almost as widely by whole foods the company has become a champion of seitan an alternative source of wheatbased protein with roots in sixth century china and last year its plantbased “benevolent bacon” was voted best new product by readers of a frozenfood trade journalswitching gearssweet earth was founded in part as a reaction to the heavy environmental impact caused by meat production —  something brian swette understands intimately given his yearlong stint on fastfood giant burger king’s boardbut the swettes are equally focused on satiating the appetites of millennials who crave unique ingredients as well as complex and global ingredients that can be traced to specific sourcestechnically speaking kelly shapes product development and merchandising — a natural fit given her background at calvin klein brian spearheads sales and operations which include a squarefoot facility in the coastal farm belt between santa cruz and monterey“as much as we are driving the sustainability piece our primary message is that we make great food brian swette said if you position your food as mainstream you can attract the mainstream consumer”close to half of us consumers with children younger than  are ”very familiar” with the organics movement compared with  percent just six years ago according to figures released in early march by the organic trade association more than 0 percent buy at least some organic productswhile the trade group hasn’t calculated figures for  annual sales of organic products grew  percent in 0 to  billioncost concernsone reason sweet earth’s visibility at target is so important perhaps the biggest enduring obstacles for scaling the organics movement has been the cost premiumcustomers will pay slightly more for organic products versus nonorganic alternatives swette said that’s partly because of the real expenses still associated with sourcing fruits and vegetables that are free of genetically modified organisms and certifying that status independently with the nongmo projectthe company works with more than 0 ingredients which makes this an extremely complex process“we need to ensure we know where everything comes from but the cost for us to do this is immense” swette said “it makes innovation harder”does swette’s food industry resume help open doors for sweet earth perhaps but the company’s knack for creating foods that are quick to prepare and healthy to eat is what seals deals“they like to see that someone can reinvent themselves — that someone can do something at a later stage of life swette saidtopics food  agriculture supply chain business models
