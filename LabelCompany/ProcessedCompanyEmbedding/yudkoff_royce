business and running it as ceo purchasing a small company lets you become your own boss and reap financial rewards without the risks of founding a startup still there are things you need to know ruback and yudkoff are the authors of the hbr guide to buying a small business download this podcast sarah green carmichael welcome to the hbr ideacast from harvard business review i’m sarah green carmichael there you are in your downtown office tower as the sun goes down it’s where you’ve worked countless hours and late nights and from your window you can see other offices with the lights on across the street other people burning the candle at both ends for the corporation just like you not everyone with a deserving resume ends up on the executive team and not everyone can be the ceo except maybe you think to yourself a little dreamily but those kids dropping out of college starting startups and running their own companies with big valuations changing the world but entrepreneurship that’s a big risk for you at this stage in your career if only there were a third way if only there were a way to be in charge be the leader you know you are get more value out of your experience but do so without the roller coaster ride of a high growth startup that’s more likely to fail than not well there is another way an open path rarely taken that is laid out in a new book the hbr guide to buying a small business the authors are rick ruback and royce yudkoff they’re here with me now to talk about it rick and royce thank you guys so much for coming on the hbr ideacast royce yudkoff it’s a pleasure to be here thank you for having us  sarah green carmichael so you’re both professors at harvard business school where you teach an enormously popular class on this topic of buying a small business and i have to say i’m a little surprised to know that so many harvard mba students are interested in this path because i associate them with this stereotype of oh they want to go into finance or consulting or maybe go out to silicon valley and start some highgrowth startup why do you think so many of your students are really interested in this topic royce yudkoff one of the factors that has excited our students about this is the opportunity to have a leadership role very early in their career not  or  years out as they’ve climbed the ranks in someone else’s company and also it avoids the tremendous risks of starting something from scratch and proving that you have a working business model instead they’re able to buy a proven business and become the ceo and within a year or two they’re really fully functioning as an entrepreneur ceo richard ruback there’s also the sense of building the world you want to live in so people want to be home with their families people want to be able to build the work environment that they want employees to live in and work in and by buying your own company you get to shape it in a way that allows you to both thrive as a human being executing the responsibilities you have as well as making a great living so you get sort of the best of both sarah green carmichael i was interested to see in the book and in your hbr article some of the examples of things that your students have gone on to do could you just maybe give us a couple of examples of the kinds of businesses that they’re running now royce yudkoff sure both rick and i can do that great small businesses operate in small offtherunniches in other words they’re not small because people don’t want to buy their product or competitors take away their products they’re small because they are a terrific competitor in some small defensible niche so our students have bought businesses like companies that process the insurance claims for local emergency ambulance services companies that clean the windows on highrise skyscrapers companies that test the fire hoses for safety at firehouses in large regions of the country richard ruback yeah there’s just lots of examples these are businesses that are small for the right reasons not the wrong reasons and by the way i should say what we mean by small we don’t mean your corner grocery store we mean businesses that have profits of about  maybe  to upwards of a  million and there are businesses of that size probably  of them royce in the united states and hundreds of thousands more throughout the world and we have students at the harvard business school from everywhere and our students go out to buy businesses all around the world we have a student who was in subsaharan africa royce yudkoff yes richard ruback who bought a yogurt– royce yudkoff manufacturer richard ruback a yogurt manufacturer in subsaharan africa royce yudkoff and we have many students who’ve done it in latin america we have many students who’ve done it in western europe we have some students in southeast asia because the phenomenon is universal– founders create these businesses they build them over  or  years and inevitably they approach retirement and for many of these people they don’t have a daughter or son who wants to take over the business and they need to sell the business because the business not only needs to give them the capital they need to retire but it also needs to have a successor ceo sarah green carmichael i think of the examples we’ve talked about yogurt might be one of the more exciting ones and i don’t mean that disparagingly richard ruback we think dull is really good sarah green carmichael dull is good richard ruback being dull is really good you want a business that is dull in the sense that there’s no exciting growth it’s growing by a little bit every year a business where customers come back and purchase from you year after year because you’re providing a great product or a great service they have no desire to look for somewhere else you’re not a big part of their business that is to say your service isn’t a big part of the costs of their business so it doesn’t pain them to shop so it’s kind of dull but dull is really good sarah green carmichael and dull is good because it’s predictable royce yudkoff exactly so the customers will buy from you year after year after year because it’s in their interests not to switch and it’s a lot of work to switch there’s some risk involved and so the financial performance of that business is really secure i’d add one more thing to rick’s comments our students who go off and do this or who examine this divide in two groups there are some students who are passionate about a type of product or service they want to be associated with but there are many students that are really passionate about being ceos and managers and they’re somewhat agnostic about the service itself in other words what excites them is that every one of their skills is tested every day as a manager they’re hiring people and teaching people and selling to customers and negotiating with vendors and handling finance issues and at the end of the day they walk out and feel today i used all of my capabilities and that’s what’s exciting to them not the particular product or service sarah green carmichael as a reality check are there downsides are there things people should think about maybe before they decide if this path is right for them richard ruback sure and one of the biggest things i think people need to think about is whether they really want the independence and responsibility that comes from running your own small business most of us believe we would like to set our own agendas but most of us really like having a boss deep down inside we like having that person that says this is what you should be doing we don’t want to tell you exactly how to do it but generally this is what you should be doing and try to get that done in the next couple weeks that level of direction everybody likes a boss to set broad agenda items and when you run your own small business the most important part of your day is setting your own todo list and it’s up to you you have to decide what’s important and how you allocate your time and you’ll either succeed or fail based on your decisions and your ability to execute that todo list and some people that’s too blank a sheet of paper and that’s too much flexibility some people like to know that work starts at  am or  am and ends at some time it just doesn’t always go with you because you’re always thinking about what the next thing you’re going to do so it’s not for everybody sarah green carmichael yeah if you’re running a business with  employees it’s not just you who’s unemployed if you mess up it’s  other people too royce yudkoff that’s a good point sarah i think that when you’re an entrepreneur the responsibilities really do end with you in a way you don’t feel they do when you’re part of a large organization and responsibility is on many people’s shoulders so when you’ve had a bad day you’ve made everybody you care about’s life worse– yourself your family your investors your employees and that really feels terrible now conversely when you’ve had a good day you really feel like you’re at the center of it all and so these emotional ups and downs that entrepreneurs report having are really big and you have to be able to handle that as an entrepreneur you have to look inside yourself and say yeah the great offsets the bad and i am perfectly comfortable managing those emotional oscillations sarah green carmichael i don’t think of people who go into these businesses or even acquire them and run them as entrepreneurs and i’m just curious to know why that is a word that you do use royce yudkoff rick and i feel like this space has been overlooked by many people who thought of their choices as being i can go work in someone else’s company or i need to come up with an idea and rub two sticks together to make fire which is of course fraught with risk but here overlooked are thousands and thousands and thousands of businesses all over the world that have been around for  and  and  years and have an enduring profitability and when you buy that company and run it you are in every sense an entrepreneur you’ve just skipped the part with no scale and where you had to prove out whether you could create a business model so what they do every day is exactly what an entrepreneur does richard ruback and if you think about a startup most startups maybe begin with blank sheets of paper but for us the most interesting part of a firm’s life is taking an idea that is proven and scaling it making it reach out to many people making it to be at the scale where you can actually employ those  people you talked about so having it be a secret enterprise with you and your buddies eating potato chips is perhaps a wonderful activity lord knows there’s nothing wrong with potato chips maybe they upgrade them to french fries in the winter but it’s that next step which i think is extraordinarily entrepreneurial sarah green carmichael if you’ve decided this is the right path for you how do you search for one of these businesses to acquire royce yudkoff well the very first step is probably creating a budget for yourself so that you can afford to do this and there are two broad paths one is that you have some savings or a working spouse who can fund this activity as you proceed to source opportunities to buy almost everyone needs to raise money for the actual acquisition from investors we can talk about that later and in this path you raise that money when you’ve found a specific opportunity but there are also many people who don’t have those resources to search and they’re not stopped because it turns out there is a network of active investors who will invest in funding a search in return for a first look at the right to invest when that opportunity comes up so one of the early decisions is do i need some backing to fund my search and the advice that comes with it or can i afford to actually go out on my own and look for a companies to buy richard ruback i think it actually starts even a little bit before that you have to put yourself in the right mindset and the right mindset is to tell yourself this is a fulltime job that is searching for a company to buy is a fulltime job it’s not something you can do occasionally on the weekends like refurbishing your playroom in the basement it’s not like that it’s fulltime and the reason it’s fulltime is one it’s an enormous amount of work so to find a company to buy most people report that they work   hours a day sourcing potential acquisitions so it’s not something you do casually so it’s really a mindset it says you have to say to yourself self i’m giving up the rest of my working life i am focusing on this activity this is going to be my passion the other thing about the mindset that’s really hard if you think about it you may be searching for a year or two to find the right business it takes that long and for every day that you don’t find the right business the day sort of kind of ends in failure sarah green carmichael oh no richard ruback because when you go home and you talk to your loved one even if it’s just a dog– maybe it’s best if it’s just a dog– and you say to the dog you know i left at  o’clock this morning or i started work in my bathrobe on my desk at  o’clock this morning and i’ve been working for  hours and i haven’t bought a company today i haven’t even talked to somebody who wants to sell to me today or i talked to somebody who might be interested in taking another phone call in two weeks and i’m calling that a victory so in the end there’s a big victory but it’s a victory that’s made up of lots and lots and lots of failure along the way if you call it failure sarah green carmichael so one of my really basic questions here is how do you even find these companies because there’s not like an ebay or a craigslist where you can just find them royce yudkoff well actually are there is let me start with the united states but what i’m going to describe is replicated in virtually every developed market around the world and many emerging markets so in the united states there are about  small business brokers so one of the first steps most searchers do is they do outreach to several of hundred of these and very quickly you’ll find that you’re getting a flow into you of somewhere around  opportunities a week of companies that are currently for sale in addition there are a couple of electronic databases where brokers or sellers will list their companies and you can go to those portals and access this too but within a couple of months of starting your sourcing you should be seeing at least  companies a week that are for sale and filtering those and rick some searchers actually supplement that by direct outreach to sellers richard ruback right so sometimes you’ll decide you really want to buy a business in a particular geography two searchers who are searching together former students whose spouses were both tied to new york city so they knew they had to buy a business in new york city so they drew a circle and said we’re just going to visit every chamber of commerce meeting we’re going to talk to every business we can within that circle and we’re going to buy a business within that circle and they did they bought a business– what was it two or three years ago– and they’re doing great– a travel business other searchers decide that there is an industry they really want to be in we’ve had examples where people fall in love with odd businesses the porta potty business had somebody fell in love with the porta potty business really wanted to buy a porta potty company and you can see why by the way right they’re a lowcap– sarah green carmichael not immediately richard ruback really really it’s an exciting business they’re plastic so they’re not very expensive to buy they’re a quick service item right– somebody services them i think we saw it was like a minute per porta potty to clean and whatever it’s like an essential thing right it’s not nobody’s going to say– sarah green carmichael when you got to go you got to go richard ruback right right and nobody’s going to renegotiate the price of the porta potty if you think about what you want in a porta potty you want it clean and available sarah green carmichael and there richard ruback and there right and so people don’t shop for porta potty providers so it’s a great business sarah green carmichael so this is interesting to me say you find a business like that that is desirable in many respects how do you start doing the research to know that this company is a good buy richard ruback well first of all let me answer the question we started this porta potty excitement one which is well ok suppose you fall in love with porta potties what do you do and the answer is you get on google or some other search engine and you find out all the porta potty service providers in the place you want to live in and you research them all and see how much they all charge and how big they are and how many trucks they own and all this stuff and pretty soon you’ll know a lot about the porta potty business by then you’ll know how much they cost you’ll know what the profit rates are you’ll know what the market penetration is you’ll know how many competitors there are in the region you’ll know a lot about the porta potty business just in a particular region with a couple of hours on a search engine maybe less so that’s how you begin to discover and then you’re going to get a list of companies and you’ll figure out which are the biggest and which are the best and you’ll start calling them and you’ll say hi this is sarah i used to host podcasts or the like but now i’ve decided to become an entrepreneur and i really want to buy one business to run and i’m really excited about your business because i’ve always wanted to own a business that services porta potties and what’s it going to feel like when you go to that cocktail party and everybody else is talking about whatever else they do and they’ll say what do you do and you’ll say– sarah green carmichael i am the porta potty queen of greater boston richard ruback i’m the porta potty queen of greater boston sarah green carmichael yes i love it ok i’m starting to see why this actually is appealing richard ruback and suppose you made  million a year as the queen of porta potties in greater boston sarah green carmichael that would be a really good feeling royce yudkoff and answer to no one sarah green carmichael yeah royce yudkoff right you’ll answer to no one this is one of the things rick and i have found as we’ve traveled across the country meeting with a lot of entrepreneurs– is in any small city there are many of these people who lead these quiet lives of great independence in businesses you might not give a second look to and they’re making  million  million a year for their families and doing work that they actually love– disassociated from whether the product is a humble one or an intensely exciting dramatic one– and they find great satisfaction in that sarah green carmichael so let’s say you’ve found the business you’re really excited about it it looks like a business where the fundamentals are strong and you call them up and maybe they’re not interested in selling maybe they are how do you have that conversation in a way that starts the negotiation how do you get the ball rolling with a business you’re serious about buying royce yudkoff there are at least a couple of early steps because you’re trying to screen down to a small number of businesses that are likely prospects from the large number of businesses that will be flowing into you and so one of the early conversations is actually about the seller’s price expectations because just like you’re a first time buyer your seller is likely to be a first time seller and some of these sellers understand what market prices are for smaller firms and some have an imaginary price that most might be associated with how much they want to have for when they retire and it’s very important that you husband your time so that it’s spent with people who have a realistic sales price so early on getting a sense of price expectations is very important and then second you really want to be buying a business which rick has used the phrase– enduringly profitable smaller firm and that means you want to be finding out some basic facts like over the last half decade has the business been steadily profitable is it cyclical or noncyclical do the customers recur from yeartoyear so as a year starts i can count on almost all of my revenues being repeated basic questions like this will quickly clue you in to whether this is a transaction you’re likely to close on sarah green carmichael ok richard ruback to royce’s very good list i would add that you want some evidence that convinces you the seller is really serious about selling and you can imagine what might compel somebody to sell– they’re ill their spouse is ill they fall in love and they want to go off to a different place with their new love lots of reasons why people do this but nobody does it unless there’s an outside reason because people who say maybe i want to do something different and they’re in their s seem to be in good health you want to be suspicious of that and the reason you want to be suspicious of that is you don’t really want to spend three months of your life pursuing an acquisition when the person can at the last moment say you know i’ve been thinking about this you’re so excited about the business maybe i should get excited about the business again i’m not going to sell sarah green carmichael yeah that’s good advice let’s say you make the deal happen– that and it doesn’t fall through it actually happens– what are some things to be aware of as you’re transitioning into the leadership role at that company royce yudkoff almost always part of the negotiated deal is that the seller will stick around for three to six months to help in the transition that means teaching you the specifics of the business the history making sure you have introductions to important clients and vendors and just smoothing that take over of the business so that eases a lot of the learning process the second thing to be aware of is that it’s a very good idea when you go into one of these businesses not to make any big changes early on because you’re going to be learning that business over the first year you’ll still make lots of decisions little decisions will come up every day and if you’ve bought the kind of business that rick and i recommend which is a sturdy enduringly profitable business these businesses are very resilient and will permit you a gradual patient period of learning richard ruback yeah i would say that the other thing to think about is just the people management as you walk in so it’s really important to be very respectful of the people who are working there they know more about the business than you do and it’s really important to be humble when we teach our class we have maybe  or so first time ceos come in to visit the class and one of my common questions is what did you wear on your first day and they all talk about if they’re buying a business that has a blue collar workforce in the midwest they’re getting rid of their designer jeans and they’re buying carhartts or levi’s or whatever is the appropriate jean for the region they’re in and they’re probably not coming in with a multicolored powerpoint presentation their first day there they’re trying to be respectful of the culture of the place and they’re trying to show that they’re going to fit in because just as you’re afraid your employees are going to quit and you’re going to be left with a hollow shell they’re afraid you’re going to fire them so you need to build some trust and credibility a couple of other things that are really important you need to be willing to do everything one of our graduates talks about how he bought a very blue collar business in nebraska and it was a business that put threads on pipes that are used in oil wells odd business right very profitable business it turns out and so the guys are on the lathe cutting the threads and the toilets won’t work and he went out to the hardware store and bought a plunger or a snake or whatever you do to unplug a toilet and unplugged all the toilets and became the hero suddenly he got enormous credibility because he was willing to do that and nobody else could do that so i think you have to do whatever it takes and the other thing i would add is that’s building credibility inside you also should build credibility outside so certainly within the first month as royce mentioned you have the seller staying with you for a transition period you and that seller need to go out how to visit all your major customers and get a proper introduction and say we’re going to maintain all the quality we’re going to keep the services exactly the same we’re all committed to providing you at least as good a business as you had before we really respect the legacy of the seller all those right things that people say as well as what is it we could do for you that we don’t do for you that would be appreciated in what you pay for and that’s how you cement those relationships which are key both inside and outside sarah green carmichael pipe threading businesses porta potty businesses– why do you think this profitable worklife balance relatively friendly way of working does not get more attention from the business press why does this fly under the radar royce yudkoff well one reason is that these businesses don’t change rapidly so there’s an absence of newsworthiness about them right they’re not introducing new products they’re not growing from  million in sales to  million in sales they are steady profitable fascinating businesses to run but they lack the newsworthiness of hightech or giant companies opening new markets richard ruback the other thing is small business owners crave confidentiality if you think about what it’s like to be a competitor in a big business if you’re competing with a company that’s a public company and you’re a public company one of the things you see is your competitor’s strategy you read it in analyst’s reports you read it in the company’s annual reports you read it in the transcripts of the conference calls but if you’re a private company you don’t have to tell anybody anything you have to tell your investors but it’s all private there are no filings that are public it’s between you your bankers your investors so you could have a tremendously profitable business that nobody knows is tremendously profitable and think about how valuable that is right because your workers don’t say wow you know joe the ceo and owner is making  million a year and i know everything joe does and i’m making  a year i think i’ll go be joe i’m going to set up my own business i’m just going to move across the street and set up my own business i’ll know the clients i’ll be able to compete if that general manager who’s getting paid  doesn’t know how profitable the business is he can’t really do that competitors can’t come in our students who are always looking for startup opportunities can’t say wow i just read in the magazine how profitable that local business is i think i’ll go do that so there’s a real economic incentive to keep that information confidential so they generally don’t seek this out royce yudkoff and so the profitability of many of these small businesses is extraordinary the highrise window washing business i referenced earlier makes  million in profit a year this regional insurance billing company for emergency ambulance services–  million a year so all over the world these private proven profitable businesses exist discretely flying below the radar screen sarah green carmichael people seem to obsess over growth both at the business level and the national level is it important for these businesses to grow or do they just have to sustain royce yudkoff well most of them grow modestly although some new entrepreneurs who buy them revitalize them and take them to the next level and that’s very exciting but let’s talk about the economics of owning one of these businesses the most magical thing about buying a small firm is the price at which you get to buy it because these firms sell for about four times their annual pretax profit so if you buy a business with  million of profit you’ll pay  million for it and so every year your investment will earn a  dividend even if you don’t grow one bit most people buy these businesses using about  debt and  equity and because of that the dividend on the equity piece they’ve put up becomes around  a year because so much of the purchase price was paid for by debt so before you start to grow this business you’re earning a return on either your money or your investor’s money or both of about  a year if you’re able to grow the business it gets even better quicker but it takes a lot of the pressure off in terms of having to reinvent the business or hit high growth targets because you’re experiencing huge success just through purchasing and running richard ruback just remember with growth comes risk right so the dollar is really good having most of your customers be customers who purchased from you before is really good because you don’t have to market very much you keep costs low you know what they want you can satisfy them they stick they’re sticky if you’re growing rapidly many of your customers are new and they don’t have that longterm relationship with you you have to build that relationship it’s a much more difficult business to run it’s much more stressful so a highgrowth business isn’t always a highrisk business but it’s much riskier because you have these new customers that don’t have this preexisting sticky relationship with you coming all the time so it’s a much harder business to get this unbreakable enduringly profitable business sarah green carmichael so this is all sounding very very appealing is there anything else about the personality or the type of person that we haven’t touched on about the kind of person who should really think about these opportunities royce yudkoff sure because entrepreneurship through acquisition isn’t for everybody the people who are drawn to it tend to be people who want a high level of professional independence they like being in a world where they make many decisions and they are happy being on their own in the sense they won’t have a lot of people like them in their small firm but for many people they crave other things in life they want to be surrounded by colleagues who have the same educational background aspirations they want to be part of a brand that they can tell people i work for harvard business school press or i work for google and that matters a lot to them and as rick said earlier in the interview that they in some sense have their professional life more structured by a larger organization and those are perfectly legitimate feelings so going down this path in a way begins with a selfassessment of what’s really important to you richard ruback right who do you like to have lunch with because if you’re the owner sarah the porta potty queen of boston is going to have lunch most of the time by herself at her desk if she even gets lunch and that’s very different than the social interactions that you get in a more established larger enterprise that have lots of successful professional welldressed people hanging around sarah green carmichael what are some of the things that might go wrong with buying a small business what are some of the things people might have to watch out for royce yudkoff of all the people we see who march down this path about  succeed in acquiring a small firm of the type we describe and usually they accomplish that in about a one to two year period so  of those people accomplish this the remaining quarter don’t and usually go back and get a job that’s similar to the job they had before they did this when they buy these businesses what we observe is that if they’re buying the kind of enduringly profitable small firm rick and i describe it’s very hard to find anyone who has gone out of business or failed because these companies are so resilient although some of them of course will face a downturn like marching through a big recession but it is a pretty resilient economic opportunity in our observation can i just add one thing to this when you ask about risks i feel compelled to remind us about the alternative which is that when you go to work in someone else’s company that’s not without risk you can be denied the promotion you think you deserve the division you work in can be shut down for any particular reason your boss can take a disliking to you and you could find your self shoved out of that company richard ruback or if i may interject your boss’s boss may take a disliking to your boss and that won’t be good for your career too and that has nothing to do with you sarah green carmichael yeah richard ruback so the real truth about any career in which you have aspirations is there are no guarantees if you want a guarantee buy a toaster sarah green carmichael excellent it’s been great doing the podcast all these years but i think i’m going to go start my business now no seriously
