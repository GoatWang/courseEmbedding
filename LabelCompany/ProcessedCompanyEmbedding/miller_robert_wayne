candidates in response to the question what do you hope to achieve if elected to the school board the candidate stated on february   “ i hope to help move the school board and school system toward being more open transparent accountable and responsive to our community i hope to help develop an atmosphere where everyones thoughts including those of employees can be expressed and accepted respectfully without fear of negative consequences i hope to help reduce the time students take standardized tests drastically change the teacheradministrator evaluation system and remove obstacles from teachers so they will be more enabled to assist students meanwhile i would like to steer attention toward providing more oneonone assistance to students who need it to learn hierarchical skills and toward training students to be organized from the early elementary school grades id like to work on increasing family involvement and student engagement id like to contribute toward modifying the way we implement special education revising the way we implement student service learning and the positive behavioral intervention supports programs are also areas i would like to address i hope to implement ways we can be more financially efficient i would like to enable us to devise a more coherent and effective plan for using technology in our schools i would also like to adjust the new elementary school model especially as it relates to the world language program in the secondary grades as well as related staffing and equity issues and to concerns with reduced related arts and technology education time ” ranking the issues the candidate was asked to rank the following issues based on how they should be prioritized by the school board with  being the most important and  being the least important each ranking could only be used once education policy click here to learn more about education policy in maryland education on the ballot issue importance ranking candidates ranking issue  balancing or maintaining the districts budget  closing the achievement gap  improving relations with teachers  improving postsecondary readiness  improving education for special needs students  expanding arts education  expanding school choice options “ assuming that this text box refers to question  and not  as stated i would like to comment on my responses first the categories can overlap and are situational and i feel that all of the categories with the possible exception of expanding school choice options are important i ranked the budget as first as the other initiatives would generally require funding i ranked closing the achievement gap as second because i think that it could have the most profound effect on our society and providing quality educational opportunities to all students should be a cornerstone of our public educational system i chose improving relations with teachers as third because i believe that many of our teachers do not presently feel supported by the our school board and i feel that our board can serve them better improvement in these areas can increase the effectiveness of teachers essentially across the board i chose improving postsecondary readiness fourth as it will apply to a large percentage of students and their future successes in college career and life i chose improving special needs education fifth as it is somewhat more focused though for that subset of students the effect of improvement could be felt more than would be for other subsets there is sometimes overlap between this concern and that of the achievement gap and it is an important matter i chose expanding arts education sixth because though there are still many opportunities to improve in this area our county is further along than most overall it is still an important concern though for some students because of careers and for others because of beneficial effects on their lives i chose school choice last because i dont see this as a need for the great majority of students presently in our county though there are occasions where it might be applicable in general potential negative consequences could result providing quality educational opportunities at all of our schools is a higher priority ” —robert w miller february   positions on the issues the candidate was asked to answer nine questions from ballotpedia regarding significant issues in education and the school district the questions are highlighted in blue and followed by the candidates responses some questions provided multiple choices which are noted after those questions the candidate was also provided space to elaborate on their answers to the multiple choice questions should new charter schools be approved in your district not all school boards are empowered to approve charter schoolsin those cases the candidate was directed to answer the question as if the school board were able to do so no if there was one that applied and provided a significant reason for its existence and it met the necessary qualifications i would not be opposed to giving it consideration otherwise they can be an unproven distraction and cause negative complications for regular public schools and the overall school system that said if the above qualifications are met i would keep an open mind charter schools that would be more effective than public schools are conceivable but appear to be rare in practice which statement best describes the ideal relationship between the state government and the school board the state should always defer to school board decisions defer to school board decisions in most cases be involved in the district routinely or only intervene in severe cases of misconduct or mismanagement the state should only intervene in severe cases of misconduct or mismanagement school board members should be specialists in their county regarding public education concerns so the school board members should generally be making the decisions affecting their schools if there are severe cases of misconduct or mismanagement the state should intervene are standardized tests an accurate metric of student achievement no actually it depends they probably have varying degrees of accuracy based on the test that is used the students being tested the subject being tested etc there are too many variables past knowledge mental state of the student on testing day type of test method of scoring etc to base important decisions exclusively on standardized tests they can have some general uses but unfortunately not only are decisions made based on standardized tests that are probably inaccurate but the results are sometimes used improperly for example i believe that standardized test scores reflect the socioeconomics of a school more than the quality of instruction that occurs in the school yet they are sometimes used to measure the latter also if standardized tests are used at all it should be in combination with other measures of achievement as some students perform better with some types of assessment than others what is your stance on the common core state standards initiative my feelings are mixed in general i think that it holds some value and promise though i think it was not implemented with sufficient input or training i think there is enough substance to be worth pursuing and tweaking at this point but it should be reevaluated at a later time how should the district handle underperforming teachers terminate their contract before any damage is done to students offer additional training options put them on a probationary period while they seek to improve or set up a mentorship program for the underperforming teacher with a more experienced teacher in the district offer additional training options put them on a probationary period while they seek to improve set up a mentorship program for the underperforming teacher with a more experienced teacher in the district though this question is difficult to answer by selecting from limited options my general feeling is that while there may be situations where teachers may have to be terminated before doing this opportunities for additional training and participation in a mentorship program while they are on a probationary period are reasonable in most cases furthermore i believe that placement options such as with students at a different age andor achievement level or at a school with a different atmosphere might be worth considering should teachers receive merit pay no if a system of merit pay was devised that was objective practical and fair i would probably be supportive of it since i know of none that has met these requirements and dont foresee any due to the variables involved in the evaluation of teachers i do not believe that one should be implemented it could result in many negative consequences which could include skewing of the curriculum teaching to tests and a focus on statistics and evaluations instead of the teaching of students should the state give money to private schools through a voucher system or scholarship program no generally the state should use public money for public schools public money should not be siphoned off to go to private schools parents may choose to send their students to private schools if they so choose but they should pay for that option taking money from public schools would likely reduce the quality of public schools public schools have been one of the most beneficial developments in making our country what it is also all other things being equal there is not proof that private schools are more effective than public schools as a whole and voucher programs have not been proven to produce superior results aside from other considerations such as the doctrine of separation of church and state public money should go to public schools which essentially any student can attend how should expulsion be used in the district though there are cases where expulsion is appropriate especially when student and staff safety are involved in general i would like to see alternatives used though there are many options including inschool or after school options i think that a special site with specialized staff would also be worth considering at least in some cases especially in a school system the size of ours whats the most important factor for success in the classroom studentteacher ratio the curriculum teachers parent involvement or school administration teachers i believe they are all important but the intersection between students and teachers is the most important overall additional themes millers campaign website listed the following themes for  “ standardized testing though standardized testing can have some valid uses ie providing possible insight into the “achievement gap” and providing possible insight into individual student achievement and skill attainment relative to other students during the past few decades it has often been misused and overused an example of misuse would be when schools are compared by evaluating standardized test scores with the mistaken assumption that the quality of a school can be determined by examining scores there are a multitude of variables affecting test scores including differences in demographics transiency prior school and environmental experiences etc which are also reasons that standardized tests should not be relied upon when evaluating teachers please see the “teacher evaluation” link regarding overuse the amount of instructional time students spend taking standardized tests and preparing for them is far out of proportion to the amount of useful information derived from the tests the valid uses of standardized testing should not require the testing of all students in almost every grade every year in addition to instructional time that is lost standardized testing causes many tangential problems during standardized testing windows resources are often used for testing instead of for learning and educators are often used for administering tests instead of for providing instruction so students who are not testing are still negatively affected when other students in their school are testing the normal functioning of the school is disrupted testing days are commonly blocked from activities and testing and makeup testing add instructional challenges when only some of a class is pulled for testing sometimes for days furthermore instructional time is lost while students practice andor prepare for the standardized tests money that could be used for instructional purposes is instead being used to purchase the standardized tests pay for the operation of the schools during the testing and compensate the staff members who administer the tests when they could be teaching though a great deal of student and staff time and money is spent on standardized testing every year from early elementary school through high school there appears to be little direct benefit to the students themselves they are not even able to see what they answered correctly and incorrectly on the tests some of the tests ie parcc are mandated by state and federal governments so we must do what we can to reduce the negative impact of overtesting while trying to bring about change at the state and federal levels until that is accomplished other countybased standardized tests ie map tests which are generally administered three times every year to most students should be reduced or eliminated as teachers often lack the time andor resources to use the results to tailor their instruction to the specific needs of their students please see “basic skills” link i imagine that for most adults the most important things they learned in school aside from the “three r’s” could not be measured by a standardized test ie creativity effort ethical reflection time spent on these tests is time taken from the other instruction furthermore excessive concern with test scores can lead to “teaching to the test” and “scheduling to the test” distorting the curriculum in order to achieve higher scores basing teacher evaluations on the tests will only make matters worse please see “teacher evaluation” link standardized testing as presently executed is a disproportional and unsatisfactory use of student and staff time and effort and of taxpayer money i would like to do what i can to change this situation by reducing the amount and frequency of standardized testing as well as by researching the possibility of using standardized tests that would provide for increased student learning by enabling students to obtain informational feedback regarding their specific test responses teacher evaluation typically the teacher evaluation system in howard county is a poor use of time and resources problems with the evaluation system include the temptation to lower standards because teachers receive a score based upon their students improvement on a task throughout the year concern that an overlychallenging task might be harmful to their evaluation score could tempt teachers to select goals that are not appropriately challenging for students a lack of validity as often teachers are grading their students with subjective tools with the grades being used in the teachers’ evaluations misuse of students’ time often by testing them on material teachers know the students don’t know in order to obtain a baseline score and then potentially spending more time on the taskobjective than would be normally spent in order to produce a better teacher evaluation score thus skewing the curriculum misuse of teachers’ time often by requiring a large amount of documentation paperwork as well as online documentation conferences with administrators and professional learning time largely devoted to the evaluation system itself all of which could be better used otherwise helping students learn misuse of administrators’ time requiring them to conference with teachers about the teachers’ evaluations and maintain documentation about them instead of observing and supporting teachers and students insufficient accounting for other variables ie students’ past experiences recently transferred students teachers abilities to work with students of different backgrounds socioeconomic intellectual parental support level etc expectation of student literacy progress even from teachers of primarily nonliteracyrelated subjects to an extent good teaching is an art not easily measured by an instrument and the present system is ineffective inefficient and often wasteful regarding time resources and money if there are teachers who are struggling administrators should be aware of this and provide teacher supports andor alternatives quickly so students are not victims of the system because of parent student and peer feedback administrators and supervisors should be well aware of educators who could use more assistance in fact there should be more articulation between administrators supervisors and educators themselves regarding the quality of instruction students have previously received the present evaluation system deprives administrators of time to evaluate and assist more effectively deprives teachers of options and instructional time and thus deprives students of learning atmosphere of enabling educators educators should feel enabled trusted and supported by school system personnel and at their individual schools yet this is often not the case procedures should be designed in ways that will minimize roadblocks in the paths of educators who are trying to do their best for their students respecting educators’ time would help to enable educators do more for their students teachers and administrators are not “hourly employees” and most put far far more time into their jobs than is required by contract insisting that they do work in their buildings that they could do just as well at home insisting that they attend meetings that are not relevant to them just because others need to attend and not treating them as professionals this is the case more in some schools than others all contribute to reducing staff morale and engagement and are antithetical to enabling central office and schoolbased administrators should see themselves as serving schoolbased teachers and instructional staff who should see themselves as serving students who should in turn be taught by families to appreciate the efforts of their educators and their education sometimes this does not appear to be occurring educators often have to jump through unnecessary hoops to comply with central office edicts when efforts should instead be made to reduce impediments to teaching and learning efforts by school personnel local media and community leaders to encourage parental support of educators where it is lacking would contribute greatly to more effective and efficient teaching and learning please see the “family involvement and student engagement” link for more about the importance of the alliance of parents and educators we need to focus efforts and resources at the “intersection of teachers and students” as that is where the rubber meets the road additionally when educators are fairly compensated as professionals they can focus on educating students without having to hold second jobs to make ends meet or travel long distances because they cannot afford to live in howard county having our educators live in our communities would be a good thing for our educators our students and our communities the best investment that our school system can make is to get and keep the best educators it is reasonable for our educators to receive salary step increases for longevity as well as costofliving increases this should essentially be a given and should be supported by our board of education also open lines of communication between board of education members central office members and schoolbased educators are important for obtaining input that will allow the best decisions to be made for our students and for the school system as a whole an atmosphere of trust should be encouraged throughout the system  ” —robert wayne miller   what was at stake  board fault lines over superintendent superintendent renee foosehoward county superintendent renee foose and a fivemember majority on the school board faced scrutiny in  over the availability of district information during fooses tenure foose was appointed to a second fouryear contract by a  vote in february  despite a petition signed by  district residents requesting a vote against renewal christine oconnor sandra h french ellen flynn giles janet siddiqui and ann delacy voted for contract renewal while bess i altwerger and cynthia l vaillancourt voted against a new contract the board majority indicated that foose met or exceeded their expectations of the superintendent altwerger and vaillancourt said that they voted against renewal because foose had damaged the publics trust in the district by failing to provide information on important district matters public frustration with foose stems from allegations that the district failed to tell parents and students about mold issues at glenwood middle school critics also challenged the districts failure to provide a full version of a special education report that cost  additional complaints cited exorbitant costs quoted by district officials to fulfill public information requests foose received backing from school system employees during
