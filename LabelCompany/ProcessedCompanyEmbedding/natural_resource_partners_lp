resource partners lp nysenrp just eviscerated its distribution cutting the payout  thats painful and investors reacted in predictable fashion sending the units sharply lower but step back for one moment now that the damage is done is this partnership finally ready to grow a changing corein  just a couple of years ago natural resource partners business was all about coal in fact roughly  of its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda came from coal related operations coal has been a rough business and natural resource partners was keenly aware of this fact so it started to diversify nrp was built on coal but its future rests elsewhere source amcyrus via wikimedia commons the effort to move away from coal has had a big impact at the end of  the partnerships noncoal business went from  of ebitda to  or so and this year that number is expected to be between  while a drop in coal revenues is partly responsible for this shift several acquisitions in oil and gas and the aggregates space were bigger contributors building off of coalthe basic idea of the shift was to use coal to build a broader portfolio of assets in theory thats a smart move in fact consol energy nysecnx basically did the same thing shifting from coal to natural gas consol started the process much earlier however and exited its least desirable coal operations in late  that changed the company from a coal miner with gas assets to a gas company with some relatively wellpositioned coal assets late start aside natural resource partners efforts to diversify relied on a drastic increase in its debt load putting numbers on that it started  with around  million in debt on the balance sheet at the end of last year that number had ballooned to nearly  billion explained another way debt is  higher than it was just a few years ago its too bad that coal prices didnt cooperate and the expansion into oil and gas has come at a time when those commodities are facing downward pressure too retrenching for the futureso at a time when the partnerships interest payments have increased nearly  the new businesses acquired have only increased the top line around  or so over  levels something had to give eventually and since coal oil and natural gas dont seem ready to rebound it was the distribution that took the hit twice this is actually the second distribution cut in the last  months with that damage done what does the future look like for the company for starters based on natural resource partners projections for the year the current distribution is covered four times over so yes the current payout should hold and a third cut seems highly unlikely but whats the company doing with the  million its saving by cutting the distribution ceo corbin robertson summed it up nicely after several years of accelerated growth and diversification through acquisitions we need to focus our attention on reducing our debt and improving our balance sheet and it looks like acquisitions are off the table too with the company noting that  organic growth of its aggregates industrial minerals and oil and natural gas assets is how it will continue to diversify thats a lot more positive than it sounds historically natural resource partners has focused on owning assets that it leases to others however its most recent acquisition in the aggregates space vantacore partners actually operates mines since natural resource partners has a whole bunch of aggregates properties that arent currently being worked all it needs to do is let vantacore have at them so growth potential could easily be rosier than it at first appears investor takeawaywhat does that mean for you natural resource partners isnt a materially different company than it was before the dividend cut in fact its likely to get more diversified and financially stronger over the next few years these things will just happen slowly if you are looking for tax losses this could be a good candidate you should have plenty of time to buy back in after  days or so that said if you are looking for a company that invests in natural resources and is expanding its reach into new areas now after the dividend cut sell off could be a
