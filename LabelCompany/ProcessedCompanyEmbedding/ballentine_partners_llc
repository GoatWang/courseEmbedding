with ballentine partners  copyright  ballentine partners client stories  ballentine partners skip to content login introduction these stories describe our work on a variety of different engagements the summaries focus on our findings and activities in the first few years of each engagement a common theme in the stories is that many of our clients had very experienced attorneys accountants investment advisors before engaging us yet we were still able to find many untapped opportunities  occasionally we also found mistakes and not because their specialty advisors had given poor advice but because they were working in silos without the benefit of the whole picture or the visibility to analyze the interactions among the different planning areas investments tax estate planning family dynamics etc prior to our becoming involved the families lacked a comprehensive strategy for managing their wealth the planning that was done was a series of individual decisions that lacked a cohesive strategy and direction in many cases the families’ prior investment advisors were subject to conflicts of interest that affected the quality of advice that the family received—for example the investment portfolios were heavily invested in proprietary products that were not performing well but generating extra fees for the advisor another recurring theme is our focus on the financial skills of the next generation ceo of a public company this family has a large and complex balance sheet and they had the benefit of excellent advisors for many years before bringing us in to lead the team we were able to add value in the following ways wealth management strategy – we worked with the ceo and his family to define a customized and comprehensive wealth management strategy for the family’s assets we also showed them how to measure their progress and test recommendations investment strategy and risk management – the family had many investment managers but no overarching investment strategy and no investment risk management strategy now they have a comprehensive investment strategy and improved net returns from their investments tax optimization – the family had no system for collecting and analyzing tax information throughout the year consequently tax planning was based on guesswork and was being done too late to be effective we designed and implemented a comprehensive tax planning system that we now use throughout each year longterm planning – based on our recommendations the family has made many changes to their estate plan to better align the plan with the family’s long term wealth management goals private investments – the family has made more than  private investments in various companies and real estate ventures many lacked proper documentation we created an electronic document library that the family office staff and all of the client’s advisors can access all documentation is now uptodate business agreements – the buysell agreements for many of the family’s private investments contained provisions that were no longer suitable we recommended a completely different approach to deal with this problem and we managed the implementation of new agreements family compound – the family vacation compound which includes very valuable real estate lacked an adequate longterm financial plan and governance structure we recommended and implemented a strategy to address these needs charitable giving – we worked with members of the next generation and the staff of the family’s private foundation to involve the next generation in the foundation and develop their financial skills in the process family meetings – the family’s key advisors now meet regularly with the family to discuss strategy and identify opportunities the ballentine partners’ client advisor assigned to the family prepares the agendas chairs the meetings and manages the family’s team of advisors members of the next generation are starting to participate in these meetings as part of their education process to learn more about how we can work with you and your family contact us sale of a privatelyowned company this client engaged us in anticipation that she would try to sell her privatelyowned company within three years she wanted to take advantage of financial planning opportunities before the sale and prepare to live off portfolio income after the sale prior to the sale of the privatelyowned company we helped her to identify and engage an investment banker who later found a buyer who paid more for the company than our client ever expected worked with our client’s tax attorney and life insurance agent to completely overhaul the client’s estate plan and life insurance arrangements helped her to transfer a sizeable chunk of the privatelyowned company’s value to a trust for the benefit of family members without incurring any gift tax worked with the investment banker to structure the sale so as to maximize our client’s aftertax wealth and to maximize the portion of the sales price that would be paid in cash restructured our client’s investment portfolio by terminating managers who were not producing any value in excess of their fees and improving the risk management process within the portfolio and helped our client to prepare for the transition from living on earned income to living on portfolio income since the sale we have overseen the management of our client’s total investment assets including assets being managed by various investment firms helped our client to smoothly transition to living on portfolio income helped our client to evaluate a wide range of direct investment opportunities and worked with an attorney who specializes in negotiating executive employment agreements to negotiate a new employment agreement for our client to learn more about the services we offer to our client families read more details about what we do inherited wealth the family is a member of the third generation in an inherited wealth situation most of the family’s wealth is now held by longterm trusts that were established by previous generations we have added value to this family with inherited wealth by redesigning the investment strategies of various trusts to make the trusts far more taxefficient when we began working on this inherited wealth situation the taxefficiency of the investment portfolios was quite poor

example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisorhow many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money it is best to find someone with plenty of experience advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the stormwhat is your strongest focus area in financial planning some advisors are experts in retirement others have expertise in estates and trusts others still are best suited to help you pay for your childs education some financial advisors focus on people who are selfemployed be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need not what someone else needswhat is your budgeting philosophy every familys budget is unique budgets can be very detailed or more general some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals others take a more balanced approach find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yourshow are you compensated some financial advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjectivedo you like the person do you trust

rosenberg january   choosing a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research
