fulltime more than  yearspros free monday lunch people are friendly majority of the company doesnt have to work too late sorry fit not you new office is really nice old officenot so much good exposure thru update meetings etc to some of the major players in pecons most middle management heavy place i have ever worked at     i feel like every department has surplus vps people who have been at the company for  years make really good money this is where the major pay bump comes into play  and yet really dont do anything a lot of vps rely heavily on their senior associatesassociatesanalysts to perform the bulk of the work and given the fact the vps easily make x what their juniors make and most analysts and associates will never make vpwell you do the math unequal treatment across departments    product and bd people seem to have it pretty well  the vps and above fit gets worked to the bone and many stay until pm regularly writing memos other investment teams ci secondary and research seem to burn thru their analysts and associates pretty quickly client services is totally unorganized and relies heavily on temp labor out of touch executives   friendly and well spoken people but poor managers becoming obvious that they have their innercircle and probably dont know the names of anyone hired in the last  years generally out of touch have their inner circle of vp and senior folk that they focus on developing problem is the vps dont care to develop their associatesanalysts feedbackreview process    genuinely the most frustrating feedback mechanism i have ever experienced if you are not drinking the hl kool aid you wont be moving up any time soon most vp people are focusing on climbing the ladder and not developing their junior talent for that reason the turnover across the junior ranks is spiking all the culture talk   some of the other reviews mentioned the guitars the excessive talk of culture etc etc this is spot on  i have never seen a place devote so much lipservice to its amazing culture and its unique environment fact its a typical cubefarm with guitars on the wall and meeting rooms named after rock stars in the middle of a bland office park  mins outside of philly and no one hangs out after work maybe the firstyear analysts but thats it because they all live in the city anyway and despite said amazing culture no one will admit there is a legit turnover issue amongst analystsassociatesadvice to managementthe company has grown significantly and you are not keeping up fit is mired in redundant processes and bureaucracy that is demoralizing people weed out some of the surplusincompetent vps  its getting ridiculous allow real room for advancement for analystsassociates and stop telling me how lucky i am because i get

been working at hamilton lane advisors fulltime more than a yearprosmost of the people who work there are relatively nice employees receive free lunch every monday also most holidays are off the new office boasts nice architecture and sleek office furniture as well exposure to various clients within the industry can be rewarding finally most of the people who work there are fairly youngcons this company seriously lacks diversity of any type there are very few women and even less people of color most of the individuals working here lacked better options so they settled for a grossly underpaid finance gig as a result most conversations lack substance and exhibit acute knowledge of private equity or finance compensation was dreadfully low one could liken the pay to working at a retail store in the mall or working at a fast food restaurant many people will gloat about the free lunches on monday however most of hamilton lanes industry peers offer free food every just about every day the company is poorly structured and flooded with inefficiencies and redundant practices in some cases you may not receive effective training on projects you are expected to complete additionally getting effective feedback is toughespecially when you dont fit the hamilton lane prototype the companys leadership can be extremely petty that leads one to wonder how a company that does so little for its employees could earn a spot as one of the best places to work in philadelphia also how does one win such an accolade being outside of the confines of philadelphia there are also very few opportunities to move up and advance in the company again how can one be content as a something year old associatemy final words are proceed with caution there will always be a better option than staying at this deadend companyadvice to managementmy advice to management would be to build actual management skills and plan strategically you will continue to thwart talented people from joining your firm if continue to run in a manner without coherent structure also decide whether or not you want entrylevel positions to be outsourced overseas or fulfilled by college graduates in the united states you

get by on its reputation as a nice place to work which is based on when it was a much smaller firm quite frankly that is getting stale the firm has growing pains caused by weak middle managers and supervisors neither upper management nor hr will change anything so it is either follow along or get out the culture’s nice but you can get the same culture elsewhere without the backstabbing and melodrama a “have” vs “have not” clique mentality is growing hr also spends a great deal of time getting on those “best places to work” list if you have to ask your employees to vote for the best place to work you probably aren’t one of those placesthe firm is famous for its conference rooms named for guitars or guitar legends whoopee it is work do you real need to have your coolness bona fide
