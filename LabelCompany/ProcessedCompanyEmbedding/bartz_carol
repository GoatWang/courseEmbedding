trump jack welch carol bartz producer notes daniel acker  bloomberg  getty images carol bartz former president and chief executive officer of yahoo inc autodesk the san francisco based software company is not exactly a household name but if you know an architect animator product designer or engineer theres a good chance they are working with autodesk software right now carol bartz is executive chairman of autodesk after  years as chairman president and ceo during that time company revenues grew from about  million to over  billion she is still one of the few women at the top of a major technology company in person her optimism and energy is contagious she likes to quote her grandmothers motto get over it and when she says we should not be daunted by a tough economy it is not from a lack of awareness or empathy she has faced tremendous personal and professional obstacles and seems only to have grown more enthusiastic she isnt dwelling on her past or her difficulties shes still looking ahead eager to figure out whats next video interview thats just irresponsible for all of us    sunday  jun    am et ‹ thats just irresponsible for all of us      am et they want a cell

business i actually like what gates did these people have done special things what personal qualities do you admire in businessconfidence humor humbleness and the ability to say you were wrong are you doing anything for the environmentautodesk both has an opportunity to itself reduce carbon footprint for the company but also to help all of our customers reduce carbon footprint so we have a dual role it’s fun what was your greatest moment in businessanytime i see the employees so excited jazzed up when a time was good a product was good there’s no better feeling it’s like your child it’s like when they succeed when the company succeeds because we’re all in it together what is your dreammy dream is that people can talk things out be logical and be willing to change their mind do you have a mottoone that i really like is “get over it and move on” what is your present state of mindexcited i’m always excited i’m kind of a junkie on what’s going to happen next transcript cnbcso tell me a little bit about what you’re doing when you travel to different countries what is the role that you play carol bartzim busy traveling to the emerging countries or as i call it the exciting growth countries because that’s where a lot of the action is for autodesk infrastructure builds recently i was in brazil poland and the czech republic there is a lot of excitement there those people are on the move so i get to talk to universities which are where the engineers of the future are coming from and i talk to the government officials obviously our customers and our partners just to get a sense of whats going on and how we can be involved in those countries i wish everybody would have the chance to travel like i do because it gives you such a broad perspective on people not that they’re taking our jobs away or this or that but theyre just people in their own right trying to make their way and it would help the world if we all understood that better cnbcyou are talking to people who are building the infrastructure carol bartzthey’re doing the railroads the transportation systems the ports the airports they’re talking about putting roads in areas that now only have very tough paths almost not roads they’re also putting in electricity and water im going to africa in a month and south africa to talk a lot about whats going on there which i think is going to emerge faster than most of us think cnbcwhat are some of the most active countries carol bartzactually what’s interesting is the polish students are the fourth largest surfers of our student web sites behind the us uk and germany i got there and said “wow these kids are with it” i was able to speak with a group of them and their questions were outstanding i could have closed my eyes and been at stanford it was just fantastic however africa is still dark for a lot of reasons and a lot of it’s frankly the electricity cnbcwhere do you think the real growth opportunities are carol bartzwell the real growth opportunities are where the middle class is coming on what do i mean they’re coming on strong they’re past food and basic shelter now they want a cell phone then they want to be entertained and then they get serious about other things to purchase that they’ve always wanted that means more factories and transportation systems which in turn means infrastructure of all sorts which means better power and better water supply so when you have the move from rural to urban in countries like that youre seeing more opportunity its just a fact cnbccan you give us some examples carol bartzfrankly anywhere in eastern europe the former soviet india china the indonesia’s of the world and the middle east my gosh whats happening in the middle east and seeing a picture of dubai does not accurately represent the excitement that’s going on there the very fact of the matter is that there are a lot of people coming into a different kind of lifestyle in these places that again require goods and services it shouldnt be a frightening concept to us citizen it should be part of the excitement of serving the whole world and taking economic advantage of these growth places the real growth opportunities in the world are where there’s mass movement from rural to urban just like by the way there was in us at the beginning of this century those people are going for opportunity theyre joining the middle class and they’re joining the world purchasers which is an opportunity for every company in the us it’s not a threat it’s an opportunity and we just need to see it that way cnbccan you talk a little bit about the flat world economy and what companies need to do to stay relevant in the flat world economy carol bartzi love the concept of the flat world and i think perhaps i jumped on it pretty quickly because as i travel i really see the fact that were much more the same than were different all of us should take advantage of what the whole world has to offer because we all are getting access to the same information the same kind of goods and services of course tailored to the things we like but why not take the opportunity when it exists in front of us the opportunity now is all over the world things arent that different anymore in fact it irritates me because i cant find good shopping anywhere anymore because it’s all the same i used to go and find these really special things and you still can find special things but it’s starting to have a sameness that just shows us that there’s opportunity for all of us that’s why i have a good feeling about what can happen in india and africa because i think they will have information access which i think means better understanding hopefully better temperament and a better place cnbcso let’s talk about the role technology serves in emerging economies carol bartztechnology is very important in emerging economies everything from the technology that serves up medicine to the technology that helps build infrastructure which of course autodesk is part of the technology of communication and information such as cell phones and the internet are using most of these places to leapfrog they’re not going to land line phones theyre going right to mobile they’re going to the latest systems because they want to be on the latest and greatest and get as quickly as they can up to standards so the opportunity for a technology company is fantastic in the emerging economies cnbchow is autodesk taking advantage of that whats your strategy carol bartzautodesk is in a wonderful position in the emerging world because our products build the world and our customers build the world which includes everything from a building to a water treatment plant to energy plants to roads bridges airports transportation systems and houses i like to say if god didnt do it our customers did because frankly the built world is what we do and i just think that’s thrilling i think it’s thrilling to go when people proudly show a new building this is the plan for a manufacturing plant and this is our new ring road around the city i just sort of puff up it’s almost like it’s been part of autodesk to do that so it’s wonderful cnbchow have you seen things change carol bartzwhen i was in poland and i hadnt been there in ten years and they said what are the differences i said i cant even begin to tell you the difference how first of all the temperament of the people the first time i went there i didnt see that many smiles im a big smiler and i didnt see that many smiles people were actually quite stern now they were smiling and the business people were well dressed they were energetic and they were excited about their future it doesnt mean that it’s going to be an easy future you still have governments to deal with you have funding to deal with you have political situations but they can see better ahead and you just feel that the first time i went our sales rep had one suit it was this thick wool suit now he looked like he walked out of the most wonderful men’s shop everyday he had a different suit everyday had a different shirt and tie and i thought to myself how far he has come with big smiles on his face and i just felt just wonderful you can’t believe the difference it’s really thrilling im actually a student of the world i think you can only really understand people and places by going there and doing as much reading as you can when i go to india i read history books about the moguls and all the different periods just to understand how they think how can i think and how can i actually join in on the conversation when you go and you actually know something about the history the people really appreciate it they say “oh you’re not just coming here to bestow some american knowledge on us you’re actually interested in what were about” frankly it just is fun to do that i always say “if you’re not an interested person you’re not an interesting person” in other words if you’re not interested enough to read to talk to people to listen then why does anybody want to listen to you what do you have to say do you just talk about your golf game yesterday who cares do you talk about just your issues what about everybody else’s issues and so i think you have to stay interested cnbcwhat’s your perspective on business cycles carol bartzi have a very basic concept of business cycles and that is that they just will happen you dont know how long they will be or how good or how bad after an up there will be a down it’s a fact these people that believe it will always get better i dont think they actually have stopped to think it’s always interesting to understand that this is going to be a really deep time down or really bubble going up and try to get that under examination and consideration to believe that we dont have business cycles to believe we dont have personal cycles political cycles weather cycles it’s just not understanding how things work so we have to get over moaning about the fact that things have changed and talk more about how we can change it the other way if it’s down how we can get up if it’s up how can we keep it up for a little longer but not the fact that it will never change that’s just irresponsible for all of the press the politicians the business people and us on the street to somehow believe that things will stay perfect business cycles will happen they always have and i promise you they always will cnbcthat’s actually reassuring carol bartzwell it is reassuring i wish people would understand and have the confidence to buck up and say things are tough now but you know what were going to work out of it that’s america so this idea somehow america is not relevant and that were going down sure the is dollar weak oil is bad but let’s get over it and do we have to do to make it better and solve it i think this time what’s got people so freaked is the word bank i think that the average person thinks oh my god the banks are in trouble that takes them back to  and all of what was going on back then and its just another transition for banking the good news is usually every industry isn’t in transition at the same time so you have a little bit of what i call the buoys or floats under the dock this time somehow we’ve convinced ourselves that the whole dock is sinking it’s just not credible cnbcdo you feel that when a business is hurting another one is benefiting carol bartzbusinesses always benefit look at the agriculture now the farmers who grew up on a farm that have sucked the wind for so long and now somebody actually wants to buy their stuff in fact more than they can make so yes when somebody’s hurting somebody else is benefiting somebody wins and somebody temporarily loses but you know what maybe they win next time and somebody else temporarily loses cnbcwhat do you think businesses should do in a down cycle carol bartzwell i think what businesses employees and people should do in a down cycle is use that as an opportunity to really get good to really take a look at what your products are what you’re doing get really close to your customers and get ready to just get market share also to drive out of there as quickly as you can rather than wallowing and feeling sorry for yourself corporations can feel sorry for them selves not just individuals and instead use that as the time to get enough paranoia to change change is so important to everybody to governments to people to corporations the ability to use the change muscle to say”time to change” i call it kind of the heart attack syndrome that is if you’ve had a heart attack the doctor says “oh you have to stop eating this and that and salt and red meat” people get all energized and you do that until you get comfortable again then you say “oh that hamburger would be good” and you forget that change was important and so you have to kind of use downturns to create the opportunity and the tension for change cnbcbecause there will be another up cycle carol bartzthere will be another upside and franklywhat do you need to change to take advantage of the upside so any time you’re feeling too comfortable i call it kind of the boring period that’s when you start saying uhoh if we dont do some change here maybe change is going to happen to us the kind we dont like so always feel a little unsettled i call it being on the balls of your feet most athletes dont stand flatfooted companies shouldnt stand flatfooted what are you going to do to be ready to move i mean you dont stand like this you stand ready to go if you’re like this you’re going to get caught you dont have the right products or the right services or something happened you always have to be ready cause that way you can go any direction if you’re flat footed somebody can push you over if you ever try standing flatfooted once and see if somebody can push you you fall if you’re on the balls of your feet you actually have some resiliency it’s a very interesting metaphor but it works cnbcwhat do you think is the best use of a down cycle carol bartzwell the absolute best use of a down cycle is to get ready for the up cycle because it’s coming cnbcdo you think that businesses get defensive as opposed to taking the offense carol bartzabsolutely cnbchow did autodesk go from one product to a huge number of products carol bartzwhen i started autodesk had one product albeit a wonderful product autocad and we looked at what our customers did and said “what they need to do in manufacturing in building construction in infrastructure is very diverse and goes beyond one product” so we started thinking about better ways to serve them now it takes a long time and you dont just snap your fingers and say “oh were going to have another good thing to sell we’re getting our customers into the world of d modeling how can you get a product that you know is ready to go so instead of making a real world prototype you can make a digital prototype you can actually understand through the modeling analysis and simulation that the building’s going to be good that its going to be ecofriendly that it’s going to work for the people that the part you want to manufacture can be manufactured instead of wasting time so we went from one product to multiple products to a really great strategy of allowing our customers to do digital prototyping not to sound too technical because the concept is simple but rather than making a lifesized car why can’t you do that model in a computer and we really moved to products that were very specific to bridges the entertainment field gaming to creating movies to buildings mechanical parts almost anything in the built world or the entertainment world is done with an autodesk product we’ve been very fortunate to move and be a yearold company that actually is just hitting its stride cnbccan you talk a little bit about d animation carol bartzwell the whole d thing now is just going to be wild it’s just wild i mean people want to be entertained it’s the same thing they want comfort in meatloaf and mashed potatoes and a good movie cnbchow is software helping with energy conservation carol bartzfrom an energy point of view and a conservation point of view we’re all trying to understand how to make buildings building construction uses forty percent of the world’s carbon consumption and twelve percent of energy in the building so fiftytwo percent of the energy consumption in the world is from buildings cnbchow come nobody says this carol bartzbecause they are all worrying about an ethanol car and nobody realizes that forty percent of the world’s energy is consumed by buildings people dont understand how important it is to design the building correctly and to understand what it’s going to do with heat transfer fresh air and all the things that happen in the building so we focus a lot on gasoline and cars but we really need to focus on our buildings cnbcso how do you integrate that into your software carol bartzpart of the strategy in our software is to help our customers really analyze how the product’s going to work so in a building is it going to be energy efficient in a manufactured product can i actually manufacture it so in other words can i do this correctly the first time and not waste so analysis in our software simulation within our software is very critical cnbcis there greater interest in energy conservation right now carol bartzmost of our architects now say that customers are asking them for sustainability concepts in their building by the way it’s happening all over the world that’s another part of this wonderful flat world is this is not just a us phenomenon in fact europe’s ahead of us asia’s very interested because these products use so much energy cnbcso in this case technology really can promote conservation carol bartztechnology in this case is the only thing that can help buildings get more energy efficient because it really can do the upfront analysis and simulation cnbchow important is education carol bartzthe only thing i want to say is that to make sure we’re encouraging our young folks our kids and especially our girls to stay with math and science so they have an option to be an engineer they have an option to build the world because i’ve seen young women turn on when they really understand but if we don’t keep them interested in fourth grade or fifth grade we’re going to lose them and that’s not good for us it’s not good for future generations it’s not good for our world it’s not good for our country so get our kids into science and math dont shy away from that related links httpwwwautodeskcom more from i am american business i am american business julie aignerclark i am american

article from feature qa former autodesk ceo carol bartz on the past present and future of construction tech author by hallie busta halliebusta • published march   construction technology is taking off as developers large and small seek digital solutions for challenges across the job site and investors respond in kind the rise of cad and later bim in the aec industry saw a similar trend and the factors that drove its growth — such as the need to customize platforms for different user groups and new hardware options — are mirrored in the uptick in thirdparty apps and the growth of mobile and the cloud carol bartz   to put the current constructiontech trend in context construction dive spoke with former autodesk ceo carol bartz who led the company from  to  as it grew from one of many digifab software options to the undisputed leader of the pack in the us today bartz is the lead director on the board of cisco systems and a member of the board of san francisco–​based aec tech startup plangrid whose mobile app digitizes project documentation construction dive talked with bartz about how autodesk handled segmentation the current landscape for construction tech and the potential for mobile this interview has been edited and condensed autodesk grew during your time there into the market leader for design and construction software to set up the conversation about these new smaller software providers what were some of the factors to which you attribute that growth bartz we really worked hard to stay on the technology curve we had open apis which was not considered a standard concept back in the s and early s we had thousands of independent software developers providing software that enhanced what autocad and some of the other products did that was unique and we developed a strong channel we went out and found architects and people in civil engineering and construction to represent and support our product to their peers that was not a standard it practice in the ’s and early ’s you want to say its because we had the best technology not true you have to have the entire ecosystem package which is how do you partner with people how do you actually get your product to market and how do you support the product once its in the market its changed today because you get your product to market online you get support online your channel everything online it doesnt matter what the period is you still have the same basic questions you led autodesk under the fail fast forward mantra what effect did that have bartz in the late ’s and early ’s autodesk was essentially a oneproduct company autocad whether you were a mechanical engineer or a civil engineer or an architect or a construction company you figured out how to make autocad work for what you needed because we didnt do that for you the internet came in the late ’s and everybody froze and said well our engineers our architects would never use the internet because its not secure not safe they dont need it thats when we had to kick into motion the fact that we have to try some things and we have try them fast and its ok to fail try to figure out quickly that whatever youre trying isnt going to work and hopefully it moves you forward try it again try something else the idea was to start looking at segments and figure out how to enhance the product so that the vertical markets felt the product was specialized toward their needs back then we worried about what the box looked like for heaven’s sake fail fast forward was getting people away from the idea that the only thing they had to do was add  new features for every autocad release what about the cloud and the rise of more portable and eventually fully mobile devices did that make a difference bartz it’s the same concept any time you dramatically change either how you get the product or how you support or service the product — for example you go from a subscription service to a cloudbased delivery service or you go from a box to downloading the software from the internet — you have to get out of your comfort zone is there a relationship between when autodesk started tailoring autocad for different segments in the ’s and what’s going on in the constructiontech space today around the emergence and development of smaller thirdparty software providers bartz theres a total relationship you could look at a database company for example and say theyre missing a b and c i could do a b and c and people will really want that thats all true but sometimes it doesn’t make it a whole company this will go on and on and on but not one company is interested in every tiny little aspect of what their customers do in the early days autodesk paid no attention to landscaping now why would you well every time a building is put on this earth something happens around it called landscaping we were happy as heck that there were over  companies that provided landscaping design software that coordinated well with autocad we didnt want that business but the customer needed a solution and small developers out there could make money by providing it voila it all works how can those thirdparty software companies today best determine whether they’ll fill a gap or be redundant  bartz look at the size of the market and the time thats wasted the real money thats wasted any time you have that kind of a problem you need answers to me getting my laundry delivered is not a real problem companies like plangrid are looking at the construction process and seeing where the holes are and are coming up with mobile solutions fix these kinds of problems in an integrated seamless way that everybody trusts and could use — youve got a huge opportunity with autodesk and other players so prevalent in the space what advice do you have for startups looking to provide these specific solutions bartz when you have a behemoth like autodesk you have to pay attention to where that giant puts its foot next you have to integrate with them hopefully you integrate with their blessing and if not you do as good a job as possible then you figure out later on whether you are truly going to be able to be a standalone public company or youre acquired or you merge with a couple others your size — there are so many options but they are real options everybody doesnt have to bang a gong at the new york stock exchange thats its own set of problems if you can gainfully employ people that are making good money and coming to work satisfied every day working on a realworld problem in conjunction with autodesk and other companies thats wonderful when you started at autodesk what did you have to do to get yourself up to speed on the needs of architects contractors and engineers that were using the software bartz i did a lot of listening more important i had a great group of people working for me that knew what they were doing and could teach this new inexperiencedinthefield ceo what the hell to talk about i give them all the credit if you dont go and find out how your customers are truly using the product and listen very carefully to what they like and dont like — and they are very happy if you sit and shut your mouth for a while and not appear defensive — you learn so much what would be an example of that bartz i wanted to visit all the main verticals so the first time i sat down with an architect i asked him what he thought about cad and autodesk and the normal stuff and he goes well i use autocad but i dont really like it because its for the engineer then i went and talked to an engineer what did i hear i use autocad but i dont really like it because its designed for the architect i thought well who the heck thinks this product is for them it had become so generalized they all indicated it was important because they were frustrated that it wasnt specialized enough for what they really wanted and they didnt feel that they were the main reason the product existed thats one trip and you already have three years worth of action to do to your earlier point about solving specialized problems plangrid as one example addresses the issue of paper project documentation with a mobile digital solution what are some other areas in the space today where smaller software providers can help provide a solution bartz we have only begun to understand what mobility means there still aren’t enough mobile devices out in the field job site phones were a big deal gps came along and you could more easily figure out if you should dig a hole or if youd run into cables mobility in the field is in its infancy as far as what its going to be able to do and so you dont have to go much further than that then you have to say what kind of mobility who needs it how do you make using mobile technology reasonably efficient so that instead of adding to users’ workloads it actually enhances their work that still has to happen follow hallie busta on twitter share
