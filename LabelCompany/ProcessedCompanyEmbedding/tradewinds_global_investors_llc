tradewinds’ aum falls  in  months lagging performance adds to the bad news for parent nuveen by randy diamond · december   assets under management at tradewinds global investors llc are down more than twothirds since the announcement in march that star money manager david iben was leaving tradewinds data show the company was managing  billion as of sept  compared with  billion at the end of february two weeks before mr iben the firms chief investment officer announced he was leaving consultants say two factors are primarily at work mr ibens strong identification with tradewinds and a heavy reliance on natural resources stocks that have underperformed in recent months related coverage former vinik exec starts kopernik global investors ill winds for nuveen subsidiary tradewinds tradewinds to shutter global all cap plus strategy  portfolio managers to leave tradewinds global investors tradewinds global cio moving to vinik asset performancewise the firm ranks at the bottom of the heap among value managers its asset collapse also has wider implications for chicagobased nuveen investments tradewinds parent nuveen which is made up of seven boutique investment affiliates had more than  billion in assets under management as of sept  tradewinds was among the most profitable units several informed sources say it was second in aum among the seven affiliates before the outflow behind nuveen asset which has more than  billion the sources said but while nuveen asset management is oriented toward fixed income tradewinds is an equity shop with average fees double those for fixed income parent nuveen has been struggling with its overall debt load which increased to  billion from  billion following a debt restructuring in september the debt resulted from madison dearborn partners llc chicago taking the company private in a leveraged buyout in  the company however now faces a new debt maturity wall of  billion in  “it will be difficult to earn their way out of this debt load” said rory callagy an analyst with moodys investors services new york mr callagy said company officials can do an initial public offering that would raise cash to pare debt or another financing if an ipo isnt feasible the september refinancing was nuveens fourth since the lbo nuveen spokeswoman kathleen cardoza said no one at nuveen or tradewinds would comment change in plans several informed sources say madison dearborn officials were hoping they could take nuveen public again this year but mr ibens departure for vinik asset management scuttled that idea glen richter chief operating officer at nuveen said in a nov  earnings call that while outflows stabilized somewhat in the third quarter he still expected more outflows this quarter he also notedthe two major wire houses that distribute tradewinds products to retail investors — ubs financial services inc and wells fargo advisors — were not adding new business while they reviewed tradewinds he said the review could take up to a year ubs officials didnt return phone calls a spokeswoman for wells fargo said no one would comment mr richter acknowledged that tradewinds aum and revenue were “significantly lower” but added that inflows at other affiliates offset the tradewinds declines nuveen reported  billion in aum at its seven affiliates as of sept  flat from the previous quarter and the third quarter of  but last quarters numbers also include  billion from gresham investment management llc a commodities manager in which nuveen purchased a  stake last december investment consultants attribute much of tradewinds asset drain to the fact that no other star was waiting in the wings when mr iben left “its great to have a star to be the signature person associated with a strategy but the danger is if the star stumbles or leaves” said consultant charlie waibel managing director of sellwood consulting llc portland ore jeffrey maclean los angelesbased ceo at wurts  associates said tradewinds and mr iben were synonymous mr iben was the sole portfolio manager for tradewinds largest strategies and mutual funds and was also in charge of overseeing the stock selection for all offerings nuveen replaced mr iben with other tradewinds investment staffers including portfolio managers but none had amassed the track record of mr iben to guard against more turnover sources say nuveen signed the roughly two dozen remaining investment personnel to twoyear contracts they say they believe nuveen remains committed to tradewinds for now but if assets were to continue to drop other actions might have to be considered tradewinds was spun out of another nuveen equityinvesting affiliate nwq investment management in  one possibility might be to reunite the two firms the sources saysubadviser outflows while initial asset withdrawals after mr ibens announcement were attributed largely to institutional clients that had a keyman clause in their contracts companies that had used tradewinds as a subadviser have followed suit northern trust co ntrs ing investment management and guidestone financial resources all terminated relationships with tradewinds in recent months resulting in the loss of more than  million in assetsjohn oconnell a spokesman at northern trust declined comment officials at ing and guidestone did not return phone calls but the firms investment performance had been challenged even before mr iben left according to data provider evestment alliance marietta ga mr ibens largest institutional strategy by assets global allcap value had strong performance in  but by the end of  the strategy lagged its benchmark the msci all country world index net of dividends by  basis points according to evestment alliance year to date through sept  the strategy has severely underperformed returning  compared with the benchmarks  the global allcap strategy separate account had  billion in aum on feb  according to nuveen data but dropped to  billion as of sept  evestment alliance reported wurts mr maclean said he believes tradewinds could rebuild its institutional client list if the firm can show a severalyear track record of solid performance sellwoods mr waibel agreed it will take time for the new team to rebuild performance but said its not impossible “the san francisco giants have won two world championships after barry bonds retired”
