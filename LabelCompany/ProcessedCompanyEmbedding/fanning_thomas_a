georgia tech foundation his executive education includes programs at the international institute for management development in lausanne switzerland the harvard university school of business and the university of virginia’s darden school of business company synopsiswith more than  million customers and approximately  megawatts of generating capacity atlantabased southern company is the premier energy company serving the southeast through its subsidiaries a leading us producer of clean safe reliable and affordable electricity southern company owns electric utilities in four states and a growing competitive generation company as well as fiber optics and wireless communications southern company brands are known for excellent customer service high reliability and affordable prices that are below the national average through an industryleading commitment to innovation southern company and its subsidiaries are inventing america’s energy future by developing the full portfolio of energy resources including nuclear st century coal natural gas renewables and energy efficiency and creating new products and services for the benefit of customers the company is continually ranked among the top utilities in fortune’s annual world’s most admired electric and gas utility rankings stem narrativeour business energy touches the lives of every family in america and stem touches every part of our business so supporting stem education is simply fundamental to our mission of providing clean safe reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we’re privileged to serve we see our jobs as about more than selling a product energy supports the economy and gives us a way to play offense to grow jobs grow personal incomes and make lives better as the energy industry continues to transform itself in an era of widespread technological innovation and changing customer expectations we need to make sure the next generation of employees has the imagination and skills necessary to thrive in a world of new challenges and opportunities stem is indispensable for preparing america’s youth for that world despite some obvious benefits to pursuing a stemrelated career – for example according to  data from the us bureau of labor statistics the average wage for all stem occupations is  nearly double the average for all other occupations – there continue to be obstacles to getting young people interested in stem not the least of these is lack of awareness or negative perceptions about the reality of working in stem fields that’s why so much of the stem outreach conducted across the southern company system involves handson experienceoriented activities that also put students — from prek to college — up close and personal with people who do the real work of improving lives through the better use of energy and we emphasize to students that a stem career offers a diversity of opportunity in the electric utility industry alone that could include among other things working as a chemical electrical mechanical civil computer environmental nuclear or industrial engineer biologist chemist programmer data and information manager environmental scientist geologist forester physicist line worker plant operator welder or instrumentation and controls technician across our primary service area of alabama florida georgia and mississippi we support stem programs by engaging students and providing educators with resources to motivate them toward pursuing stemrelated careers southern company system employees regularly visit classrooms to talk with students about their careers we host career expos camps technology demonstrations robotics teams and competitions we partner with schools to develop curricula and award teachers who develop creative and effective approaches perhaps most important our employees serve as mentors and role models these and other efforts have helped expose thousands of young people to the opportunities presented by stem while also letting them in on a little secret – stem is fun we are encouraged when we hear as one yearold in florida told us recently after attending a career expo cosponsored by our gulf power subsidiary that the experience had for the first time sparked an interest in someday having a job in the energy industry at a time when men still outnumber women in stem fields we are especially committed to help clear the path for girls to reach their full potential many of our efforts are targeted to overcoming the notion that stem is “not for girls” michele jordan a southern nuclear engineer working on the plant vogtle  and  construction project in georgia — which is leading the revival of nuclear power in america — is among those who have given their time to be positive examples for girls “i love having the opportunity to talk to young girls and encourage them to go into technical fields” she said “when i was in college i had professors telling me i couldn’t do it and i want them to hear that they can” as important as it is for southern company’s continued success to create a pipeline of qualified stem workers within our own ranks the real priority is to connect stem outreach with our larger mission of making the communities we serve better off because we’re there we continually ask ourselves what do our communities need to succeed and how can we help supporting education and stem in particular just makes good sense there is a direct link between stem which prepares young people for good wellpaying jobs and broader economic development that can help improve the standard of living for everyone in the southeast the manufacturing defense and hightech industries are vitally important and stem learning aligns perfectly with their ongoing need for highly skilled workers the growing new marketplace of jobs in the digital economy only underscores the importance of stem science technology engineering and math have been so fundamental to the energy industry’s ability to make lives better through advances that made the simple act of turning a switch to light and heat our homes an everyday reality that we often take for granted today stem is leading the use of robotics unmanned aerial systems and other amazing new technologies that are ushering in the future of energy we at southern company are proud to support stem education and are excited to think about what those students in stem classrooms today will come up with tomorrow thomas fanning   stemconnector type and press “enter” to search x thomas a fanning atty  ronks pa
