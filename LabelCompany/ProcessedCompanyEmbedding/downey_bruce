has expired but you can still read the transcript below  email susan dentzer how will a generic version of prozac or fluoxetine be priced bruce downey generally the–a sole source generic is discounted  to  percent off the brand price susan dentzer so consumers could expect to see substantial savings then bruce downey they can see–their savings will come in two steps the first step is when we’re on the market as an exclusive generic it will be less expensive than the lilly product and then once that six months of exclusivity expires additional competitors are authorized to enter the market and there’ll be another substantial discount at that time so their discounts will be seen over two periods one now and one six months from now susan dentzer and how much competition are you expecting to come in in that time bruce downey i think there are seven or eight companies ready to to enter the market once the exclusivity runs so there’ll be substantial competition at that point in time susan dentzer and at that point what happens to this product in terms of what it does for your profitability bruce downey well it’ll reduce it we expect–we do however expect to remain the sort of the dominant player in the prozac generic prozac market we’ll be in every drug store in america we’ll be defending that market share against competitors and and we’ll continue to be the market leader in the product susan dentzer what lessons does this whole experience tell us about–there are many large drugs which are about to come off patent in future years and lilly’s behavior as you said has been somewhat unusual what what–what do you think what lessons can we derive from this whole experience about future patent expirations bruce downey well i would expect in future expirations expiries you’ll see companies more aggressive than lilly’s been i mean that’s my expectation in terms of preserving their market but i think this shows a couple of things one a determined generic company in this market does have the resources and the will to take on these challenges and bring the products to market and i would expect not only barr but many of our larger competitors to to continue to press these issues and bring products to market and so i think consumers can rest assured that they’ll get access as they expect to i’d add one other lesson is that it shows that the provision of the law that grants six months of exclusivity as a reward for successfully challenge the patents–whoops–i mean if it wasn’t for that reward period there’d be no willingness on our part or any other large company’s part to invest all of the money and time and effort into the patent challenge you’d simply pursue other product opportunities and and sit back and wait for the patents to expire and that would allow these strategies of getting addon patents to be successful so the reward system here really is the key to what’s happened and i think it shows that that it works susan dentzer why is this a less challenging issue converting people now over to the generic formulation bruce downey well i think that there are two reasons one they’re such–so so visible and so wellpublicized that people understand the availability of the product earlier in the product life cycle than a normal generic launch so the awareness of pharmacists and patients of its being on the shelf will bring them to accept the the you know to ask for the generic product or dispense it and there’s a corollary to that because it’s such a large product there are financial incentives on in the pharmacies to ensure the patients are aware of the product and dispense the generic because pharmacists frankly earn a higher margin or higher profit on on generics than they do brand products and so i think that those two factors combined will make this substitution easier than most susan dentzer so for the cvs’s of the world the rite aids of the world– bruce downey they have they have–you know it’s a great service to their patients and their customers to offer the equally good product at a lower cost and it’s good business sense for them to do that because they earn a higher profit so– susan dentzer you don’t think that the name prozac is going to be of such power that it’s going to block any of this transition to the generic formulation bruce downey i think it will have very little impact yes susan dentzer you’re gonna earn a fair amount of money for at least six months off of this product bruce downey yes susan dentzer what are you going to do with the proceeds of that bruce downey well we have a very active rd program particularly on our proprietary side we also are in a proprietary business and we have a number of clinical studies underway or planned in the future and this is going to allow us to accelerate our development in that area and i think we’ll be able to make very good use of the proceeds susan dentzer and in general terms what areas of drug development are you engaged in bruce downey for the most part our efforts are centered on women’s health care we have a proprietary oral contraceptive currently in development we’re looking at some other–we just agreed to merge with duramed they have a hormone replacement product that we think’s a very good product and some addon products yet that that need funding for the clinical trials so we’re gonna continue to focus our proprietary efforts for the timebeing in women’s health care and that’s where the proceeds will go share on facebook share on twitter share via text are you aware of our comment policy pbs newshour

such as adoption or inheritance documentsquestions one should ask a lawyer before hiring themto ensure you find a competent attorney who wont abuse your trust or drain your finances you have to make the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle the more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs the bettertop reasons to hire a lawyeryou may keep a lawyer on retainer or

decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution this is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the lineits not just a matter of legal knowledge lawyers have access to numerous resources you do not they have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserveyou cant be impartial during times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of levelheaded thinking for example divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners

  to the extent today’s statements made by management during the company’s discussions contain information that is not historical these statements are essentially forward looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified consequently actual results may differ materially from those expressed in today’s call i would also like to remind investors that we

sec today on form k at  am and in our most recent annual report on form k in quarterly report on form q and filed with the sec all of which are available on the investor relations portion of the barr

that we deem to be strategic to our competitive position the company’s press release was issued at  am eastern time and subsequently faxed or emailed to all of you who have requested to be added to

of the call will be available from  noon eastern time today through  pm eastern time on april  details on accessing the replay will be provided at the end of today’s call i would like to introduce our chairman bruce downey   bruce downey  barr pharmaceuticals  chairman and ceo   thank you carol good morning everyone we had a very strong quarter again  cents earnings per share on a split adjusted basis that is also a gaap adjusted basis versus  cents a year ago for the nine months ended march  we earned  postsplit per share on an adjusted gaap basis versus  a share a year ago the adjustments to the gaap earnings are all detailed in our press release but for the most part relate to four  different product acquisitions the product line we acquired last fall plan b in generics acquisitions which were completed this quarter and the acquisition of the transactional ring or the acquisition of all of the remaining rights to that product which also occurred in this past quarter our revenues also were very strong  million for the quarter versus  million a year ago for the nine months ended march  our revenues were approximately  billion versus approximately  million a year ago bill will go through many of the individual financial items in the press release and the financial statements but there are two that i think are particularly noteworthy that i want to call your attention to first our manufacturing margins were again in the high  range i think they remain the highest in the industry we’re very proud of that accomplishment and we continue to focus on high margin products and also our rd spending is at an alltime high again i think something we’ve prided ourselves in that we’ve developed a very large number of attractive products and we think the level will continue to produce the products and allow us to continue to grow our business   on the generic side of the house we had a very good quarter we currently have  applications pending at the fda we’ve had  approvals this year which it’s not the highest in the industry it certainly is among the top two or three in the industry in a quarter we launched our th oral contraceptive product and have three more pending at the fda we have  products in development approximately of those are  capsule products that incorporate not only just immediate release technologies but our sustained release technology our liquid fill capabilities and the like we also have now  products in development that uses other forms of drug delivery totaling as i said over  in all the three items i’d like to call your attention to actually that has occurred this quarter or will occur later this quarter that i think are noteworthy and we should bring to your attention first i’d like to remind everyone that our exclusive distribution agreement on ciprofloxacin ends june  therefore you could expect sales of that product to decline in this quarter and decline very significantly beyond this quarter   second just this week in fact i think the release went out yesterday we received approval for our generic avcon products and we’ve optioned that as we disclosed in an earlier press release and now have  days to exercise that option and license the product on the exclusive basis for five years if they decline to exercise that option we will be launching the product either late this quarter or early next quarter and finally we’ve also announced we’ve settled the two cases tim herd and extra step cases which we had against a company for two patents of course it provides no obstacle to anyone else who might want to challenge the product or the patents on those products and we think this was a very fair and good settlement good for us and good for our shareholders   our proprietary business also remains very strong we had record sales in the quarter and a proprietary side of the business we recognized the remaining revenue from the stocking orders to seasonale which were shipped last fall the scripts on seasonale to continue to grow nicely they continue to track ahead of the launches of ortho tricycle on a basis therapy basis we are very proud of that and we think the launch is going extremely well we began our director consumer print media campaign in march it’s continued  continues to this day we’ve so far had ads appearing in “people” “glamour” and “cosmo” and “in style” and a number of magazines where we think the readership would be interested in the product we will begin our radio and tv director consumer ad program later this summer we think that  and our market research has shown  that when women go to their physician asking or inquiring about a particular contraceptive product there is a very high probability they will leave the office with a prescription for that product so we want to make this option well known and well understood by women so they can consult a physician about the product and we think that will help us increase significantly our market share over time i also mentioned in the comments about the adjustments to the gaap earnings two of the acquisitions were finished this quarter the plan b acquisition and oxytrans vaginal ring acquisition on the plan b front we are currently selling a product as an rx product the produce date for the switch application date is may  we think not all of the questions at the fda has asked about the product following the very successful advisory panel meeting and we are very optimistic and hopeful that we will receive approval on that date or approvable on that date as is often the case when you get an approvable they are still labeling issues to be negotiated particularly on a no tc switch application so an outright approval is probably not likely but an approvable subject to labeling negotiations is i guess the more realistic outcome   we continue a very aggressive development program in our proprietary side of the house we will be  have completed or will be finishing shortly dp  extended oral contraception study and the vaginal estrogen cream study the cream products should be filed in this quarter with the fda the dp  products will be filed next quarter the first  quarter of fiscal  and we continue to have a full portfolio of our products going through our pipeline so we’re very pleased with our progress in that area   finally as we have said in our press release we want to reaffirm guidance so that we have provided for this year a  to  increase over the record year that we had in fiscal  this translates poststock split into  to  cents for the current quarter when you do the math based on performance to date or on an annualized basis  to  for the year and if you go back presplit that translates to  to  as earnings per share on the basis they were originally computed when we first gave the guidance last summer   with that i’ll turn the call over to bill to provide more detail on the financial statements after which we’ll take questions from the audience being mindful that we have a commitment up here at cibc has a conference at  so we might not be quite as chatty today as we normally are bill i want you to take the financial statement   bill mckee  barr pharmaceuticals  cfo ok thank you bruce good morning everyone i wanted to just take a minute and go through the adjustments which are described in the press release there were essentially two adjustments that affected the third quarter bruce mentioned one that affected also the nine months but in the quarter essentially two charges the first of which was a  share charge resulting from the company’s decision to acquire schering ag’s rights and obligation under the product development and license agreement with enhanced pharmaceuticals that barr assumed in our june  acquisition of enhanced at the time of that acquisition and based on the terms of that product development agreement we had signed a fair value of approximately  million to that agreement at the end of march when barr and schering agreed barr would acquire back the worldwide right to the product we also agreed to forego remaining expense reimbursements milestone payments and royalties and agreed to assume back all the remaining responsibilities for the development filing and marketing of the product as a result of that a change in the terms of that product development agreement even though we ultimately believe that the product is more valuable to us under the new terms because of the change in the terms we were required to write down write off the remaining unamortized value of that product development agreement which amounted to about  million on a pretax basis and resulted in a  cent charge in the quarter the second charge relates is a combined charge of  cents in the quarter resulting from our two transactions in the emergency contraception category namely our acquisition of women’s capital corporation and the acquisition of certain assets of gynetics   about  cents of that cent charge relates to the ip rd value we assigned to the pending application for the overthecounter version of plan b and the remaining two cents arises from expensing the  million payment we made pursuant to our asset purchase agreement with gynetics both of those transactions the women’s capital and the gynetics transactions were previously disclosed in a press release as was the charge and as well the schering transaction also was previously disclosed and so people looking for perhaps some additional information i would ask you to check the previous press releases on that   turning to the product sales area leading the  increase in year over year sales or sales of ciprofloxacin which totaled  million in the quarter as we discussed at our analysts’ conference a sequential decline in cipro sales was expected and reflects the shift in customer buying patterns as we approach the end of bayer’s pediatric exclusivity period in early june bruce mentioned in his opening comments things to think about as you think about the fourth quarter and really continues to be consistent with what we anticipated and described at our analysts’ conference a few weeks back   generic product sales increased  to  million of that total our generic cline generated  million in sales which was an increase of  over the prior year our other generic product sales increased  climbing to  million contributing to that increase were sales of metazerpin which we launched in december  and our sales of generic acutane which we launched in mayproprietary product sales increased more than  year over year to  million led by about  million in seasonale revenue which we launched in november contributions from products we acquired from wyeth and higher year over year sales of cenestin which totaled  million in the quarter   as bruce mentioned our seasonale sales for the quarter includes about  million that had been deferred at the time of launch the year over year increase in cenestin sales reflects a higher pricing and the unusually lower sales we recorded in the march quarter last year due to customer buying patterns for the ninemonths cenestin sales totaled approximately  million and we now expect cenestin sales for fiscal  to exceed the high end of the range we previously had given of  million to  million development development and other revenue increased  million from the prior year to  million included in our development revenue this quarter is a  million payment made to us by galen ph for their option to license our generic product and bruce talked a little bit about that in his opening remarks also included in development and other revenue are reimbursements from schering under our product development agreement and in line with my earlier comment those reimbursements will cease beginning in the fourth quarter an offset to that loss of revenue will be the fact that we have been incurring about  million of amortization charges on the intangible that has been written off so there will be an offset to the lost development revenue from schering which had been running about  to  a quarter   proceeds from our patent challenge settlements are down year over year as expected and i think as most of you know those were proceeds we received under our distribution agreement relating to the settlement of our ciprofloxacin and patent challenge and we  those payments ended when we began distributing the products so we no longer recognize those proceeds from the patent challenge   margins on product sales the overall margin on product sales for the quarter was about  compared to  the prior year the decline year over year resulted from sales of ciprofloxacin which is both a distributed product and a product subject to a profit split carries a lower margin than our other products our margins on products other than cipro contributed margins in the high  range as bruce mentioned earlier up slightly compared to the same period a year ago rd expenses in the quarter were approximately  million up about  million from the prior year that increase was driven by a  million writeoff on the product development and licensing agreement i previously mentioned and the  million ip rd charge related to women’s capital corp excluding those charges our rd spending still increased  compared to last year’s levels reflecting the higher costs associated with our increased product development activities including increased thirdparty product development costs higher raw material purchases and an expansion in our proprietary product development staffing areassga costs for the quarter were approximately  million up  or  from last year this year over year increase was led by increasing advertising and promotional costs for seasonale higher selling costs associated with our march  expansion of our women’s healthcare sales force higher legal costs primarily related to solve the arbitration and an increase in business development and other intellectual property matters the sga also included the  million writeoff related to gynetics which i mentioned earlier and also contributing to the increase for higher information technology costs including the initial costs of developing and implementing our new ertsystem a tax rate in the quarter our effective tax rate increased to  as compared to about  in the prior year the tax rate for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by the writeoff of the ip rd costs associated with the women’s capital acquisition which is not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes excluding the impact of that nondeductible ip rd amount the effective tax rate in the quarter was about    turning to the balance sheet cash and marketable securities totaled  million at march  cash from operations for the three months ended march was about  million operating cash was generated principally by our net income adjusted for noncash charges including depreciation and these items more than offset our increases in working capital our higher working capital in the quarter was primarily attributable to higher inventories including higher ciprofloxacin inventories which result due to the timing of our purchases from buyer these increases were offset by lower receivables due to cipro sales in the quarter and the timing of sales within the quarter   capital spending was about  million in the quarter led by investments in our information technology product including the new erp system and also include the costs to expand our smma production capabilities and packaging capacity bruce mentioned the outlook reiterating our guidance for  to  resulting in a range on a split adjusted basis an adjusted basis of  cents at  and implied range of  to  cents for the quarter ending june  as we always remind everyone that the range for the year and for the quarter don’t include any potential costs or revenues associated with any business development activities or legal settlements and so forth that may be completed by june  with that i’ll turn it back over to carol   carol cox  barr pharmaceuticals  vp of investor relations thank you bill we’d like to open it now to a question and answer period
