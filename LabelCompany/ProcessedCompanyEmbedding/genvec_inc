therapies download pdf gaithersburg md march   prnewswire  genvec inc nasdaq gnvc today announced that it has formed a collaboration with therabiologics to develop cancer therapeutics leveraging both genvecs proprietary gene delivery platform and therabiologics proprietary neural stem cell nsc technology    in exchange for an economic participation in the products being developed under the collaboration genvec will contribute technology knowhow vector construction and technical and regulatory support to the program  therabiologics will be responsible for all other development costs the initial goal of this collaboration is to generate a nextgeneration product candidate to therabiologics tbx tbx utilizes an established nsc line engineered to express a modified carboxylesterase enzyme that converts the prodrug cpt irinotecan to the potent chemotherapy agent sn which is x more toxic to cancer cells than cpt  genvecs proprietary adenovectors will be used to provide important manufacturing and potency advantages to other adenovirusderived vectors and will utilize welldefined production methodologies that have already produced clinical trial material for over  study patients nscs offer an unprecedented advantage of therapeutic specificity over conventional cancer treatments as a result of their inherent tumortropic properties stated therabiologics founder and chief scientific officer karen s aboody md the nscs selectively target invasive cancer sites resulting in tumorlocalized chemotherapy production sparing the rest of the body from toxic side effects  genvecs technology provides us with a wellvalidated process for modifying these cells to reach their full therapeutic potential therabiologics has demonstrated the promise of nscmediated approaches to treat cancer and we believe that genvecs technology will greatly facilitate the development of these novel treatments stated douglas j swirsky genvecs president and chief executive
