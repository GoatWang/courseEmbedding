growth over the coming years harvard business school professor gary loveman joined harrahs as chief operating officer in  and would go on to serve as chief executive officer from  to  in  the company moved its headquarters from memphis to las vegas purchase of caesars entertainmentedit harrahs made its largest single expansion in  when it acquired caesars entertainment inc for  billion negotiations were spurred on by news of a merger agreement between mgm mirage and mandalay resort group the two companies sold several properties ahead of the merger to assuage antitrust concerns including harrahs east chicago and harrahs tunica the acquisition increased harrahs portfolio to  casinos plus four cruise ship casinos the deal furthered harrahs goal of gaining a larger presence on the las vegas strip where caesars owned four casinos and improved its ability to market to high rollers harrahs began to push for a larger international presence in  announcing joint venture agreements to build casinos in spain slovenia and the bahamas and applying for a license to build a major resort in singapore though none of these projects would come to fruition harrahs also acquired london clubs international in  and the macau orient golf club in  from  to  the company consolidated control of a long stretch of the east side of the las vegas strip acquiring the bourbon street

ownership of harrahs real estate as a separate real estate investment trust reit hoping to attain the higher pricetoearnings ratios at which hotel companies traded compared to gaming companies in  the discussions evolved toward the idea of a leveraged buyout of harrahs by bondermans company tpg capital another private equity firm apollo global management approached loveman about a buyout and he encouraged them to collaborate with tpg by the end of the year an agreement was announced for the two companies to buy harrahs for  billion in cash plus  billion in assumed debt the transaction closed in january  leaving harrahs with  billion in debt the linqedit it was widely announced in previous years that the company planned to implode properties and build new ones from scratch but after the market downturn the company conceded that it had little experience in building major resorts instead it developed project linq in  which calls for retaining and improving all existing buildings while adding a collection of about  restaurants and bars to be built along a winding corridor between the companys imperial palace osheas and flamingo casinos on the east side of the strip it is an attempt to create the kind of entertainment district that has developed organically in cities such as los angeles memphis and new orleans yet is lacking on the strip with its enclosed casinocentric zones if this new zone is successful it will provide competition for the fremont street experience new las vegas arenaedit the anschutz entertainment group first tried to build an arena in las vegas in association with harrahs entertainment in  the joint venture announced they would build a  seat stadium behind the ballys and paris casinohotels caesars entertainment inc had previously envisioned using the location to build a baseball park but the companys buyout by harrahs cancelled the plans through the following year harrahs got uncertain on continuing with the project not knowing if aeg would split the costs and whether building a major leagueready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring financial crisis the original plans were to break ground in june  and finish the arena in  but by  it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection in  the plans were changed to use an area behind the imperial palace however given the financing would require a special taxation district opposition from clark county regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further aeg eventually backed out completely by  once mgm resorts international came up with their own project using a terrain behind the new yorknew york and monte carlo resorts this attracted aeg primarily for not relying on public funding the acquisition of planet hollywood provided harrahs with a contiguous acre  ha property bordering the strip the vacant lots behind the casinos had been slated for a sports arena large enough to hold a professional basketball or hockey team the three casinos will have over  rooms which can be directly connected to the arena it was announced in august
