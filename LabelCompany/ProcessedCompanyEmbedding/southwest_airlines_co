business model based on southwests system include malaysias airasia the first and biggest lcc in asia indias indigo australias jetstar a subsidiary of qantas although jetstar now operates two aircraft types philippiness cebu pacific thailands nok air mexicos volaris indonesias lion air and turkeys pegasus airlines although southwest has been a major inspiration to many other airlines including

business model based on southwests system include malaysias airasia the first and biggest lcc in asia indias indigo australias jetstar a subsidiary of qantas although jetstar now operates two aircraft types philippiness cebu pacific thailands nok air mexicos volaris indonesias lion air and turkeys pegasus airlines although southwest has been a major inspiration to many other airlines including ryanair airasia lion air and jetstar the management strategies for example of ryanair airasia lion air and jetstar differ significantly from those of southwest all these different management
