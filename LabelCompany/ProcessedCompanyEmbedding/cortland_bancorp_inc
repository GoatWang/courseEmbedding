compensation programs cortlands compensation programs for its executive officers are generally administered by or under the direction and supervision of cortlands compensation committee which is responsible for reviewing and recommending to the independent members of the board of directors for approval the salary bonus and all other compensation and benefits to be provided to cortlands chief executive officer and other executive officers the companys chief executive officer and human resources manager annually review the compensation and performance of each executive officer of cortland other than the chief executive officer whose compensation and performance is reviewed by the compensation committee the results of these reviews are communicated to the compensation committee along with recommendations regarding compensation adjustments for the ensuing year the compensation committee either approves the recommended compensation adjustments or makes modifications in its discretion the compensation committee then makes its final recommendations to the independent members of the board of directors for approval in setting salaries for cortlands executive officers the compensation committee and human resources manager use pay ranges that are established based on publicly available market data regarding compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers at other companies pay ranges are established and adjusted periodically with reference to market data from publicly available compensation surveys for each employee position or category within cortland the pay range that is established includes a minimum a midpoint and a maximum salary although the compensation committee generally does not target a specific point within the pay range for executive officer salaries the compensation committee strives to ensure that its executive officer compensation remains competitive with the compensation provided by other financial institutions with which cortland competes for executive talent annual incentive plan for executive officers  at its march   meeting the board adopted the annual incentive plan for executive officers the plan is a shortterm cash incentive plan paying additional cash compensation of a maximum of  of salary if specified annual objectives are achieved the plan objective is to align the interests of management to that of the shareholders by paying out only upon achieving an acceptable shareholder return the performance objectives can include bankwide performance objectives business unit goals and individual performance goals adopted by the compensation committee at its october   meeting the six bankwide performance goals in effect for  and  were based on return on equity return on assets net interest margin efficiency ratio noninterest expense divided by the sum of taxequivalent net interest income and noninterest income asset quality net chargeoffs as a percentage of average loans classified asset coverage meaning assets classified substandard or doubtful as a percentage of the sum of tier  capital and the allowance for loan and lease losses and loan loss exposure meaning nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans and each executives individual performance evaluation with each of the six goals having its own assigned weight if targeted performance is achieved a participating officer will receive a cash bonus ranging from  to  of base salary depending on the level of goal achievement assuming targeted goals are achieved for a calendar year cash distributions under the plan    table of contents occur in the first quarter of the immediately following year it is not necessary to achieve each of the performance goals to become entitled to a cash incentive bonus under the plan ceo james m gasior coo timothy carney senior vice president and chief lending officer stanley p feret and senior vice president and chief financial officer david j lucido are participants in the annual incentive plan the annual incentive plan may be terminated by the board of directors at any time severance agreements  cortland is a party to severance agreements with messrs gasior carney and lucido messrs gasior and carney are entitled by their severance agreement to an immediate lumpsum cash payment if a change in control occurs the amount of the payment is  times the sum of their base salary and the most recent annual bonus if the executives employment terminates involuntarily but without cause or voluntarily because of an adverse change in employment circumstances to which he did not consent in advance in either case with termination occurring within  months after a change in control he would also be entitled to continued medical dental accident disability and life insurance coverage for up to three years mr lucidos severance agreement is similar to that of messrs gasior and carney except that  x  the changeincontrol benefit of mr lucido is  times compensation and  y  the changeincontrol benefit is payable if and only if mr lucidos employment is terminated within  months after a change in control whether because of involuntary termination by cortland without cause or voluntary termination by mr lucido because of a material adverse change in employment circumstances to which he did not consent in advance the severance agreements prohibit competition with cortland in trumbull portage or mahoning counties in ohio for one year after employment termination the executives are entitled to a payment equal to  times compensation after employment termination in exchange for the agreement not to compete unless  x  they also receive or are entitled to receive changeincontrol benefits under the severance agreement or  y  their employment termination occurs after age  or on account of retirement the severance agreements of messrs gasior and carney provide that the postemployment prohibition against competition does not apply if a change in control occurs the severance agreements protect the executives against a challenge by cortland after a change in control occurs providing the reimbursement of the executives legal expenses to enforce the agreements against cortland after a change in control the agreements have threeyear terms extending at each anniversary for one additional year a copy of the severance agreement of each of messrs gasior carney and lucido is attached as an exhibit to the form k current report filed by cortland with the sec on december   if a change in control occurs and the total benefits or payments to which an executive is entitled constitute socalled excess parachute payments and are therefore subject to the  excise tax under irc sections g and  whether under the severance agreement or under any other compensation arrangement cortland must by the terms of the severance agreements also make an adjusted grossup payment to messrs gasior carney and lucido compensating them for the excise tax as well as for income payroll and excise taxes imposed on that parachute payment excise tax reimbursement payment a  excise tax is imposed under section  if the value of an executives aggregate changeincontrol benefits  calculated according to procedures specified in section g and accompanying irs regulations  equals or exceeds three times the executives fiveyear average taxable compensation the fiveyear average is known as the base amount if the value of the aggregate changeincontrol benefits equals or exceeds three times the base amount a  excise tax is imposed on all benefits exceeding the base amount and the employer forfeits its compensation deduction for those same benefits the total adjusted grossup payment to messrs gasior carney and lucido would consist of  a payment equal to the initial excise tax and  a grossup payment that is equal to  of the difference between  x  the amount that would fully compensate the executives for all income payroll and excise taxes imposed on the excise tax reimbursement payment and  y  the excise tax payment itself the grossup benefit is not deductible compensation salary continuation agreements  messrs gasior carney and lucido are also parties to salary continuation agreements with the cortland savings and banking company the salary continuation agreements provide messrs gasior carney and lucido with an annual normal retirement benefit payable for  years beginning at age  and payable regardless of whether the executives continue working past age  the annual benefit amount is  for mr gasior  for mr carney and  for mr lucido a reduced benefit is payable for termination before attaining age  the amount of the reduced benefit being the amount that amortizes over  years the liability accrual balance existing when termination occurs mr lucidos early termination benefit is also subject to a vesting requirement vesting in equal  increments on the first ten anniversaries of the agreements june   effective date but becoming fully vested if a change in control first occurs for termination before full vesting mr lucidos early termination would be based on the vested accrual balance if a change in control occurs before attaining age  instead of an annual retirementage benefit mr gasior and mr carney would be entitled to an immediate lumpsum payment equal to the liability accrual balance projected to exist at their age  normal retirement age but the payment would be discounted to present value after a change in control mr lucido would be entitled to a lumpsum payment equal to the existing liability accrual balance but only if within  months after the change in control mr lucidos employment termination occurs involuntarily but without cause or voluntarily on account of an adverse change in employment circumstances to which he did not consent in advance the salary continuation agreements employ the definition of the term change in control that is contained in irc section a and implementing regulations    table of contents like the severance agreements the salary continuation agreements provide for reimbursement of legal expenses for the executives if the agreements are challenged by cortland after a change in control occurs the salary continuation agreements of messrs gasior and carney prohibit them from competing with the bank for two years after employment termination the prohibition against competition is void if a change in control occurs however finally although the salary continuation agreements do not commit cortland to changing the executives benefit amounts in the future as amended in late  the agreements require cortland to review every three years whether the retirement benefits payable under the agreements continue to be sufficient to provide the intended retirement income security for the executives a copy of the agreement of mr gasior and mr carney  the november   seventh amended salary continuation agreement  is included as an exhibit to the form k current report filed with the sec on december   a copy of mr lucidos november   amended salary continuation agreement also is included as an exhibit to the form k if messrs gasior carney and lucido die before age  in active service to the bank instead of salary continuation agreement benefits payable to messrs gasior carney and lucido their beneficiaries will receive a life insurance death benefit in a fixed amount as informal financing for the salary continuation agreement payment obligation arising out of an executives death before retirement the cortland savings and banking company purchased life insurance policies on certain officers lives including messrs gasior carney and lucido the life insurance policies are owned by the bank but the bank entered into endorsement split dollar arrangements allowing the executives to designate the beneficiary of a portion of the policy death benefits the bank will receive the remainder of the death benefits messrs gasiors carneys and lucidos split dollar agreements provide that the split dollar life insurance benefit expires when the nonqualified deferred compensation obligation is fully accrued at age  even if the executive is still working for the bank although the bank expects the split dollar life insurance policy benefits to finance the expense for the payment obligations under the salary continuation agreements of messrs gasior carney and lucido the executives contractual entitlements under the agreements are not funded and remain contractual liabilities of the bank a copy of the agreement of mr gasior and mr carney  the april   fourth amended split dollar agreement and endorsement  is included as an exhibit to the form k current report that we filed with the sec on april   a copy of the agreement of mr lucido  the march   endorsement split dollar agreement  is included as an exhibit to the form k annual report that we filed with the sec on march   group term carve out plan   in december  the bank purchased with a single premium payment approximately  million in life insurance on the lives of  officers adopting a group term carve out plan that allows those  officers to designate through a split dollar life insurance endorsement the beneficiary of a portion of the life insurance proceeds the bank is entitled to all proceeds other than the portion allocable to the officers designated beneficiaries a number of the original  officers have since terminated but those who remain include messrs gasior and carney the group term carve out plan was amended and restated as of november   a copy of the november   amended and restated group term carve out plan is included as an exhibit to the form k current report filed with the sec on november   as amended and restated the group term carve out plan provides that  unless an individual participating officers split dollar life insurance endorsement states otherwise  an executives beneficiaries are entitled to one of the following death benefit amounts preretirement death benefit  if the executive dies before retirement the death benefit is the least of a  b twice the executives current annual salary at the time of death less  or c  of the life insurance policy net death proceeds meaning total death proceeds minus policy cash surrender value or postretirement death benefit  if the executive was no longer employed by the bank at the time of death but had terminated employment within one year after a change in control or due to disability or on or after the early retirement age of  the death benefit is the least of a  b the executives most recent salary at the time of death or c  of the life insurance policy net death proceeds meaning total death proceeds minus policy cash surrender value the bank receives the remainder of the life insurance policy death benefits which should be sufficient to recover in full the banks life insurance investment no benefits are payable under the plan to any executive whose employment terminates before the age of  unless termination is due to disability or unless termination occurs within one year after a change in control benefits are payable to the executives beneficiaries in a lump sum when the group term carve out plan was amended and restated effective november   the split dollar life insurance endorsements of participating officers were also replaced by new endorsements the new endorsements eliminate the preretirement death benefit as a result the designated beneficiary of a participating officer will be entitled to a life insurance death benefit under the group term carve out plan if and only if the officer dies after employment termination and only if employment termination occurred on account of disability or within one year after a change in control or after attaining age  the benefit amount is limited as described under the heading postretirement death benefit above    table of contents employees also have life insurance benefits under the banks group term life insurance program paying benefits up to twice the executives current annual salary at the time of death to the executives beneficiaries if the executive dies while employed by the bank profit sharing program  the bank maintains a profit sharing plan designed to provide incentives to eligible employees to contribute toward the achievement of superior performance eligible employees are those in good standing and who do not participate in other incentive programs executive management is not eligible the board performance criterion for  was return on assets based upon the level of  return on assets the board approved a profit sharing pool that paid  of salary for eligible employees employee benefit plan k  the bank maintains a traditional k retirement plan for employees in general the bank matches participants voluntary contributions up to  of gross pay employee contributions and matching contributions under the plan accumulate tax free until distributions begin at the employees normal retirement age the goal of the k plan is to enable employees to provide for their own retirement and combined with social security benefits to ensure that their aggregate postretirement income is maintained at a percentage of preretirement income sufficient to sustain a longterm retirement perquisites and other compensation  the compensation committee annually reviews the perquisites that the management team receives in the case of messrs gasior carney and lucido membership in a golf or social club is encouraged to provide an appropriate forum for entertaining existing customers developing and promoting new business and generally interacting with influential members of the local community irc limits   cortland considers tax and accounting implications in the design of its compensation programs section m of the irc places a limit on the tax deduction for compensation in excess of  million paid to the chief executive officer and four most highly compensated executive officers of a corporation in a taxable year all of the compensation cortland paid in  to the named executive officers is expected to be deductible under section m the executive compensation committee retains the flexibility however to pay nondeductible compensation if it believes doing so is in the best interests of cortland transactions with related persons the board is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the procedures designed to identify related party transactions that are material to cortlands consolidated financial statements or otherwise require disclosure under applicable laws and rules adopted by the sec and the board has the authority to approve such related party transactions in addition each director and executive officer of cortland must complete a director and officer questionnaire that requires disclosure of any transaction arrangement or relationship with cortland or the bank during the last fiscal year in which the director or executive officer or any member of his or her immediate family had a direct or indirect material interest any transaction arrangement or relationship disclosed by a director or executive officer in the questionnaire is reviewed and considered by the board in making independence determinations with respect to directors and resolving any conflicts of interest that may be implicated during the companys  fiscal year the bank entered into bankingrelated transactions in the ordinary course of business with certain executive officers and directors of cortland including certain executive officers of the bank members of their immediate families and corporations or organizations with which they are affiliated it is expected that similar transactions will be entered into in the future all loans made to directors and executive officers i were made in the ordinary course of business ii were made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to cortland and iii did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features the outstanding principal balance of loans to directors executive officers and principal shareholders of cortland including certain executive officers of the bank and their associates as a group at december   was  million as of the date of this proxy statement all of these loans were performing loans     table of contents outstanding equity awards the following table shows as of december

executive compensation  proposal two  we are subject to section a of the securities exchange act of  which requires that we provide to our shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of the executive officers named in the summary compensation table commonly known as a sayonpay vote the shareholder vote required by section a is an advisory vote which means that the vote is not binding on us on our board of directors or on the compensation committee the sayonpay vote is intended to be a vote on the executive officer compensation that is disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the disclosure rules of the securities and exchange commission the goals of our compensation arrangements are to provide fair and competitive compensation to provide compensation that promotes the hiring and retention of the most talented personnel to create incentives for and to reward superior performance and to align the interests of our officers and employees with the interests of shareholders we seek to avoid creating incentives for unnecessary or excessive risktaking avoid creating incentives for excessive focus on stock price performance instead of fundamental business values avoid creating incentives to seek shortterm benefits at the expense of longterm results and avoid creating incentives to achieve shortterm benefits with longterm risks with the assistance of the compensation committee the board believes that cortlands compensation arrangements avoid these adverse incentives and instead reward performance promoting our longterm prosperity although the arrangements are continually evolving and are and will remain subject to ongoing review and evaluation by the board and by the compensation committee we are asking shareholders to vote on the following resolution at the  annual meeting resolved that the compensation paid to the companys named executive officers as disclosed in cortland bancorps proxy statement for the  annual meeting in compliance with item  of the securities and exchange commissions regulation sk including the compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby approved approval of a majority of the votes cast will constitute approval of this proposal to approve the named executive officer compensation disclosed in this proxy statement an abstention or broker nonvote is not counted as a vote cast and as a result will have no effect on the vote to approve the proposal a proxy that does not specify voting instructions will be voted in favor of this nonbinding advisory proposal although the results of the sayonpay vote will not be binding on us we expect to take the results into account in future compensation decisions the board recommends a vote for approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement    table of contents amendment of the code of regulations  proposal three  the board of directors has adopted declared advisable and is submitting for stockholder approval an amendment to the companys code of regulations to increase the mandatory retirement age for members of the companys board of directors the companys code of regulations currently imposes a mandatory retirement age of  the company proposes to increase this mandatory retirement age by making directors eligible for one additional term after they have first attained the age of  or above the adoption of this amendment requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock the second sentence of article two section  of the companys code of regulations currently provides as follows no person who has attained the age of seventy  shall be eligible for election as a director if the proposed amendment is approved by shareholders the second sentence of article two section  of the companys code of regulations will be amended to read as follows a director whose term expires after he has first attained the age of seventy  shall be eligible to serve one additional term as a director for the reasons set forth below the companys board of directors has adopted and is submitting for stockholder approval an amendment to this provision of the code of regulations to increase the current mandatory retirement age for directors the effect of the amendment as proposed will be to establish a mandatory retirement age of  to  depending upon the directors age when his or her term expires after he or she first attains the age of  the board believes that a more flexible mandatory retirement age for the companys directors is in line with other community bank holding companies in the companys market and is an appropriate and commonsense act of corporate governance the current mandatory retirement age could deter wellqualified candidates who are approaching the mandatory retirement age from agreeing to serve as directors and could result in the premature retirement of experienced directors who are valuable members of the board of directors with deep knowledge of the companys history and operations providing a degree of flexibility in director retirement would give the company the opportunity to benefit from the valuable expertise of directors for a longer time while maintaining a mandatory retirement age that is in line with the average retirement age of directors of other bank holding companies the company has surveyed twelve bank holding companies located in ohio that as of december   had securities registered under the securities exchange act of  and consolidated assets of between  million and  billion the company found that its current mandatory retirement age of  is on the low end of that survey based on the publicly available codes of regulations and corporate governance guidelines of the surveyed companies nine of the twelve companies have a mandatory retirement age higher than the companys current retirement age of  or have no mandatory retirement age at all   number of companies    mandatory retirement age          no mandatory retirement age        age         age         age     increasing the companys mandatory retirement age for directors will bring the company into better alignment with similarly situated bank holding companies in ohio and will allow the company to be more competitive with its peers in the recruitment and retention of experienced directors in  the company appointed two seasoned directors to the board each of whom had significant prior experience with publicly traded bank holding companies in the companys market areas the companys appointment of these experienced directors has had a positive impact on both business development and corporate governance the proposed amendment to the code of regulations would give the company the required flexibility to attract and retain additional directors of that caliber    table of contents if approved by the shareholders this amendment to the companys code of regulations will become effective immediately upon approval and the board of directors will also make conforming changes to its corporate governance guidelines regarding the retirement age for directors the board recommends a vote for the proposal to adopt amended section  of the code of regulations ratification of independent auditors

committee believes that the nonaudit services provided by sr snodgrass pc are compatible with maintaining the auditors independence to the best of cortlands knowledge none of the time devoted by sr snodgrass pc on its engagement to audit cortlands financial statements for the year ended december   is attributable to work performed by persons other than fulltime permanent employees of sr snodgrass pc cortlands code of regulations do not require the submission of the selection of independent auditors to shareholders for approval however the board believes it is appropriate to give shareholders the opportunity to ratify the decision of the audit committee to appoint sr snodgrass pc as cortlands principal accountant neither the audit committee nor the board will be bound by the shareholders vote at the annual meeting but may take the shareholders vote into account in future determinations regarding the retention of an independent auditor    table of contents recommendation

cortland believes such shareholders are members of the same family or otherwise share the same address or in which one shareholder has multiple accounts if in each case such shareholders have not opted out of the householding process each shareholder would continue to receive a separate notice of any meeting of shareholders and a separate proxy card the householding procedure reduces the volume of duplicate information that shareholders may receive and reduces cortlands expense cortland may institute householding in the future and will notify those registered shareholders who will be
