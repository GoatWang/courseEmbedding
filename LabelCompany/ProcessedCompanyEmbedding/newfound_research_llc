tearsheet and brochure for the multiasset income strategy are available in our document center outlook process design availability with historically high equity valuations and low interest rates forecasted returns for traditional us core asset classes are anemic  we believe that high income asset classes are not only more fairly valued but also offer a higher yield meaning they can be used not only for their income potential but also as an engine of growth within a portfolio beginning with a diversified universe of  global highincome asset classes the portfolio evaluates each asset class for its ongoing trend strength assets identified as exhibiting negative trends and therefore a potential risk to capital safety are removed from the portfolio after screening out asset classes exhibiting negative trends the remaining exposures receive an allocation in proportion to their riskadjusted income with single positions capped at  if  or fewer asset classes remain a position in

to provide turnkey access to a set of higher income generating vehicles in a risk managed frameworkpursue returnwhile the asset classes utilized in this portfolio are most often evaluated for their yield potential in an environment of high equity valuations we believe these asset classes actually have the potential to increase the total return of a portfolio due to their structurally higher
