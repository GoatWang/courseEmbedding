smith seemed to be the last of the oldline gm chairmen a conservative anonymous bureaucrat resisting change however propelled by industry and market conditions smith oversaw some of the most fundamental changes in gms history when smith took over gm it was reeling from its first annual loss since the early s its reputation had been tarnished by lawsuits persistent quality problems bad labor relations public protests over the installation of chevrolet engines in oldsmobiles and by a poorly designed diesel engine gm was also losing market share to foreign automakers for the first time deciding that gm needed to completely change its structure in order to be competitive smith instituted a sweeping transformation initiatives included divisional consolidation forming strategic joint ventures with japanese and korean automakers launching the saturn division investing heavily in technological automation and robotics and attempting to rid the company of its riskaverse bureaucracy however smiths farreaching goals proved too ambitious to be implemented effectively in the face of the companys resistant corporate culture despite smiths vision he was unable to successfully integrate gms major acquisitions and failed to tackle the root causes of gms fundamental problems a controversial figure widely associated with gms decline smiths tenure is commonly viewed as a failure as gms share of the us market fell from  to  and the company lapsed close to bankruptcy during the early s recession consequently cnbc has called smith one of the worst american
