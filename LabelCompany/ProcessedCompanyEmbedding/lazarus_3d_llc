any inconveniences as we upgrade and update our website recently featured on abc  news sorry for the ad ﻿welcom﻿e to lazarus d we have invented a unique technology allowing us to rapidly prototype soft models with properties similar to human tissue this is allowing doctors to rehearse difficult operations before they happen and to improve training in surgery and medicinewe are bringing this cutting edge d printing technology to the texas medical﻿ center and beyond from overnight models of human tissue to unique pieces of scientific equipment we work to empower scientists clinicians and legal teams with cutting edge d printing capabilities   are you looking for a d printing solution to your problem﻿ contact us for a quote heres what our clients are saying i believe your d model of my
